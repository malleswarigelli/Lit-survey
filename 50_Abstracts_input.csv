Title,Abstract
Metabolic engineering of volatile isoprenoids in plants and microbes,"The chemical properties and diversity of volatile isoprenoids lends them to a broad variety of biological roles. It also lends them to a host of biotechnological applications, both by taking advantage of their natural functions and by using them as industrial chemicals/chemical feedstocks. Natural functions include roles as insect attractants and repellents, abiotic stress protectants in pathogen defense, etc. Industrial applications include use as pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, fuels, fuel additives, etc. Here we will examine the ways in which researchers have so far found to exploit volatile isoprenoids using biotechnology. Production and/or modification of volatiles using metabolic engineering in both plants and microorganisms are reviewed, including engineering through both mevalonate and methylerythritol diphosphate pathways. Recent advances are illustrated using several case studies (herbivores and bodyguards, isoprene, and monoterpene production in microbes). Systems and synthetic biology tools with particular utility for metabolic engineering are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss the practical realities of various applications in modern biotechnology, explore possible future applications, and examine the challenges of moving these technologies forward so that they can deliver tangible benefits. While this review focuses on volatile isoprenoids, many of the engineering approaches described here are also applicable to non-isoprenoid volatiles and to non-volatile isoprenoids."
The nonmevalonate pathway supports both monoterpene and sesquiterpene formation in snapdragon flowers,"Terpenoids, the largest class of plant secondary metabolites, play essential roles in both plant and human life. In higher plants, the five-carbon building blocks of all terpenoids, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate, are derived from two independent pathways localized in different cellular compartments. The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP or nonmevalonate) pathway, localized in the plastids, is thought to provide IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate for hemiterpene, monoterpene, and diterpene biosynthesis, whereas the cytosol-localized mevalonate pathway provides C5 units for sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Stable isotope-labeled, pathway-specific precursors (1-deoxy-[5,5-2H2]-D-xylulose and [2,2-2H2]-mevalolactone) were supplied to cut snapdragon flowers, which emit both monoterpenes and the sesquiterpene, nerolidol. We show that only one of the two pathways, the plastid-localized MEP pathway, is active in the formation of volatile terpenes. The MEP pathway provides IPP precursors for both plastidial monoterpene and cytosolic sesquiterpene biosynthesis in the epidermis of snapdragon petals. The trafficking of IPP occurs unidirectionally from the plastids to cytosol. The MEP pathway operates in a rhythmic manner controlled by the circadian clock, which determines the rhythmicity of terpenoid emission."
A unified mechanism of action for volatile isoprenoids in plant abiotic stress,"The sessile nature of plants has resulted in the evolution of an extraordinarily diverse suite of protective mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses. Though volatile isoprenoids are known to be involved in many types of biotic interactions, they also play important but relatively unappreciated roles in abiotic stress responses. We review those roles, discuss the proposed mechanistic explanations and examine the evolutionary significance of volatile isoprenoid emission. We note that abiotic stress responses generically involve production of reactive oxygen species in plant cells, and volatile isoprenoids mitigate the effects of oxidative stress by mediating the oxidative status of the plant. On the basis of these observations, we propose a 'single biochemical mechanism for multiple physiological stressors' model, whereby the protective effect against abiotic stress is exerted through direct or indirect improvement in resistance to damage by reactive oxygen species."
Redirection of cytosolic or plastidic isoprenoid precursors elevates terpene production in plants,"Terpenes constitute a distinct class of natural products1 that attract insects2, defend against phytopathogenic microbes3 and combat human diseases4. However, like most natural products, they are usually made by plants and microbes in small amounts and as complex mixtures. Chemical synthesis is often costly and inefficient, and may not yield enantiomerically pure terpenes, whereas large-scale microbial production requires expensive feedstocks. We engineered high-level terpene production in tobacco plants by diverting carbon flow from cytosolic or plastidic isopentenyl diphosphate through overexpression in either compartment of an avian farnesyl diphosphate synthase and an appropriate terpene synthase. Isotopic labeling studies suggest little, if any, metabolite exchange between these two subcellular compartments. The strategy increased synthesis of the sesquiterpenes patchoulol and amorpha-4,11-diene more than 1,000-fold, as well as the monoterpene limonene 10–30 fold, and seems equally suited to generating higher levels of other terpenes for research, industrial production or therapeutic applications"
Volatile isoprenoids and their importance for protection against environmental constraints in the Mediterranean area,"Among plant secondary metabolites, volatile isoprenoids have received increasing attention because they are involved in a range of physiological and ecological interactions, often helping plants cope with abiotic and biotic stressors, and potentially affecting the chemistry of the troposphere once they are emitted in the air. We review evidence about the beneficial functions of volatile isoprenoids in leaves, principally as antioxidants and membrane stabilizing agents, avoiding heat damage. Because the Mediterranean environment is characterized by prolonged dry and hot seasons, and recurrent heat-waves, we surmise that volatile isoprenoids are particularly widespread, and play an important physiological role, in Mediterranean woody plants. Based on a review of available inventories, isoprene emission characterizes deciduous woody plants, whereas evergreens are more often monoterpene emitters. Monoterpene emitters may be better fit to the Mediterranean climate, and, in general, to climate conditions favoring evergreens."
Genome organization in Arabidopsis thaliana: a survey for genes involved in isoprenoid and chlorophyll metabolism,"The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway provides intermediates for the synthesis of a multitude of natural products which serve numerous biochemical functions in plants: sterols (isoprenoids with a C30 backbone) are essential components of membranes; carotenoids (C40) and chlorophylls (which contain a C20 isoprenoid side-chain) act as photosynthetic pigments; plastoquinone, phylloquinone and ubiquinone (all of which contain long isoprenoid side-chains) participate in electron transport chains; gibberellins (C20), brassinosteroids (C30) and abscisic acid (C15) are phytohormones derived from isoprenoid intermediates; prenylation of proteins (with C15 or C20 isoprenoid moieties) may mediate subcellular targeting and regulation of activity; and several monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and diterpenes (C20) have been demonstrated to be involved in plant defense. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genes coding for enzymes involved in the metabolism of isoprenoid-derived compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana. By combining homology and sequence motif searches with knowledge regarding the phylogenetic distribution of pathways of isoprenoid metabolism across species, candidate genes for these pathways in A. thalianawere obtained. A detailed analysis of the vicinity of chromosome loci for genes of isoprenoid metabolism in A. thaliana provided evidence for the clustering of genes involved in common pathways. Multiple sequence alignments were used to estimate the number of genes in gene families and sequence relationship trees were utilized to classify their individual members. The integration of all these datasets allows the generation of a knowledge-based metabolic map of isoprenoid metabolic pathways in A. thaliana and provides a substantial improvement of the currently available gene annotation"
My way: noncanonical biosynthesis pathways for plant volatiles,"Plant volatiles are crucial for various interactions with other organisms and their surrounding environment. A large number of these volatiles belong to the terpenoid and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid classes, which have long been considered to be exclusively synthesized from a few canonical pathways. However, several alternative pathways producing these plant volatiles have been discovered recently. This review summarizes the current knowledge about new pathways for these two major groups of plant volatiles, which open new perspectives for applications in metabolic engineering"
"Plant volatile terpenoid metabolism: biosynthetic genes, transcriptional regulation and subcellular compartmentation",Volatile terpenoids released from different plant parts play crucial roles in pollinator attraction
Both methylerythritol phosphate and mevalonate pathways contribute to biosynthesis of each of the major isoprenoid classes in young cotton seedlings,"In higher plants, both the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and mevalonate (MVA) pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. However, despite a significant amount of research on the activity of these pathways under different conditions, the relative contribution of each to the biosynthesis of diverse isoprenoids remains unclear. In this work, we examined the formation of several classes of isoprenoids in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). After feeding [5,5-2H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose ([5,5-2H2]DOX) and [2-13C]MVA to intact cotton seedlings hydroponically, incorporation into isoprenoids was analyzed by MS and NMR. The predominant pattern of incorporation followed the classical scheme in which C5units from the MEP pathway were used to form monoterpenes (C10), phytol side chains (C20) and carotenoids (C40) while C5 units from the MVA pathway were used to form sesquiterpenes (C15), terpenoid aldehydes (C15 and C25) and steroids/triterpenoids (C30). However, both pathways contributed to all classes of terpenoids, sometimes substantially. For example, the MEP pathway provided up to 20% of the substrate for sterols and the MVA pathway provided as much as 50% of the substrate for phytol side chains and carotenoids. Incorporation of C5 units from the MEP pathway was highest in cotyledons, compared to true leaves, and not observed at all in the roots. Incorporation of C5 units from the MVA pathway was highest in the roots (into sterols) and more prominent in the first true leaves than in other above-ground organs. The relative accumulation of label in intermediates vs. end products of phytosterol metabolism confirmed previous identification of slow steps in this pathway."
"Biochemistry of terpenoids: monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes","Terpenoids represent the largest class of secondary metabolites and usually do not contain nitrogen or sulfur in their structures. Many terpenoids serve as defence compounds against microbes and herbivores and/or are signal molecules to attract pollinating insects, fruit-dispersing animals or predators which can destroy insect herbivores. As a consequence, many terpenoids have pronounced pharmacological activities and are therefore interesting for medicine and biotechnology. The first part of the biosynthesis is the generation of a C5 unit, such as isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) or dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Two independent pathways have been discovered that can produce the C5 unit: the mevalonate and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Depending on the number of C5 units, we distinguish hemiterpenes C5, monoterpenes including iridoids (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), sesterterpenes (C25), triterpenes (including steroids) (C30), tetraterpenes (C40) and polyterpenes (>C40). The biosynthesis (including enzymes, genes and their regulation) of mevalonate and the methylerythritol phosphate pathway and the consecutive pathways leading to mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes are discussed in this chapter in detail."
Multiple stress factors and the emission of plant VOCs,"Individual biotic and abiotic stresses, such as high temperature, high light and herbivore attack, are well known to increase the emission of volatile organic compounds from plants. Much less is known about the effect of multiple, co-occurring stress factors, despite the fact that multiple stresses are probably the rule under natural conditions. Here, after briefly summarizing the basic effects of single stress factors on the volatile emission of plants, we survey the influence of multiple stresses. When two or more stresses co-occur their effects are sometimes additive, while in other cases the influence of one stress has priority. Further investigations on the effects of multiple stress factors will improve our understanding of the patterns and functions of plant volatile emission"
Multi-substrate terpene synthases: their occurrence and physiological significance,"Terpene synthases are responsible for synthesis of a large number of terpenes in plants using substrates provided by two distinct metabolic pathways, the mevalonate-dependent pathway that is located in cytosol and has been suggested to be responsible for synthesis of sesquiterpenes (C15), and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway located in plastids and suggested to be responsible for the synthesis of hemi- (C5), mono- (C10), and diterpenes (C20). Recent advances in characterization of genes and enzymes responsible for substrate and end product biosynthesis as well as efforts in metabolic engineering have demonstrated existence of a number of multi-substrate terpene synthases. This review summarizes the progress in the characterization of such multi-substrate terpene synthases and suggests that the presence of multi-substrate use might have been significantly underestimated. Multi-substrate use could lead to important changes in terpene product profiles upon substrate profile changes under perturbation of metabolism in stressed plants as well as under certain developmental stages. We therefore argue that multi-substrate use can be significant under physiological conditions and can result in complicate modifications in terpene profiles"
Metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways leading to isoprenoids: Mono-and sesquiterpenes in plastids and cytosol,"Isoprenoids are a large and structurally diverse family of compounds that play essential roles in plants as hormones, photosynthetic pigments, electron carriers, and membrane components as well as serving in communication and defense. Now it is unequivocally proved that two distinct and independent biosynthetic routes exist to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the two building blocks for isoprenoids in plants. The cytosolic pathway is triggered by Acetyl Coenzyme A where classical intermediate mevalonic acid is formed which, in turn, converts into IPP and DMAPP. These further combine to elongate into sesquiterpenes (C15) and triterpenes (C30); whereas the plastidial pathway provides precursors for the biosynthesis of isoprene (C5), monoterpenes (C10), diterpenes (C20), and tetraterpenes (C40). The pathway is initiated by the transketolase-type condensation of pyruvate (C-2 and C-3) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DXP), followed by the isomerization and reduction of this intermediate to 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP), formation of the cytidine 5'-diphosphate (CDP) derivative, phosphorylation at C2, and cyclization to 2-C-methylerythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (CDP-Me2P as the last defined step). The genes encoding each enzyme of the plastid pathway up to formation of the cyclic diphosphate have been isolated from plants and from eubacteria where the pathway exists. Studies on the complete biosynthetic pathways using radio-labeled substrates will help in characterizing and identifying the enzymes involved in each and every step of cyclization, isomerization, chain elongation, hydrogen shifts, oxidation and hydroxylation during the formation of many isoprenoid compounds present in food and flavor substances and are highly useful to human beings"
Biochemistry of plant volatiles,"Plants produce a plethora of volatile compounds for both general and specialized functions. Recent advances in instrumentation, coupled with our present ability to isolate and characterize genes and the enzymes they encode from many diverse plant species, have greatly enhanced our understanding of how plants synthezise such compounds and regulate their production. The next level of understanding should surely come from studying the significance of these volatiles for plant physiology and their impact on the ecological interac- tions of plants with their environment"
Plant volatiles: recent advances and future perspectives,"Volatile compounds act as a language that plants use for their communication and interaction with the surrounding environment. To date, a total of 1700 volatile compounds have been isolated from more than 90 plant families. These volatiles, released from leaves, flowers, and fruits into the atmosphere and from roots into the soil, defend plants against herbivores and pathogens or provide a reproductive advantage by attracting pollinators and seed dispersers. Plant volatiles constitute about 1% of plant secondary metabolites and are mainly represented by terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, fatty acid derivatives, and amino acid derivatives. In this review we focus on the functions of plant volatiles, their biosynthesis and regulation, and the metabolic engineering of the volatile spectrum, which results in plant defense improvement and changes of scent and aroma properties of flowers and fruits"
Biosynthesis of essential oils in aromatic plants: A review,"In aromatic plants species, biosynthesis of essential oils occurs through two complex natural biochemical pathways involving different enzymatic reactions. Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) are the universal precursors of essential oil biosynthesis and are produced by the cytosolic enzymatic MVA (mevalonic acid) pathway or by plastidic and enzymatic 1-deoxy-d-xylolose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway, also called the 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. In the particular plant cell part, prenyl diphosphate synthases condense isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) further to form prenyl diphosphates, which are used as substrates for geranyl diphosphate (GPP; C10) or for fernesyl diphosphate (FPP; C15). Essential oils are final terpenoid products and are formed by a huge group of enzymes known as terpene synthases (TPS). Essential oils are important secondary metabolites of plants and have been used not only in different industries but also in ethnobotanical medicines for centuries. Hence, considerable research has been undertaken to understand the essential oil biosynthetic pathways. This review will be a valuable source of information in the field of natural products, as we give detailed insights about biosynthesis of essential oils in plants and thus indicate also new unexplored horizons for further research"
Terpenoid biosynthesis and specialized vascular cells of conifer defense,"Defense-related terpenoid biosynthesis in conifers is a dynamic process closely associated with specialized anatomical structures that allows conifers to cope with attack from many potential pests and pathogens. The constitutive and inducible terpenoid defense of conifers involves several hundred different monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Changing arrays of these many compounds are formed from the general isoprenoid pathway by activities of large gene families for two classes of enzymes, the terpene synthases and the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases of the CYP720B group. Extensive studies have been conducted on the genomics, proteomics and molecular biochemical characterization of these enzymes. Many of the conifer terpene synthases are multi-product enzymes, and the P450 enzymes of the CYP720B group are promiscuous in catalyzing multiple oxidations, along homologous series of diterpenoids, from a broad spectrum of substrates. The terpene synthases and CYP720B genes respond to authentic or simulated insect attack with increased transcript levels, protein abundance and enzyme activity. The constitutive and induced oleoresin terpenoids for conifer defense accumulate in preformed cortical resin ducts and in xylem trauma-associated resin ducts. Formation of these resin ducts de novo in the cambium zone and developing xylem, following insect attack or treatment of trees with methyl jasmonate, is a unique feature of the induced defense of long-lived conifer trees"
Biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene germacrene D in Solidago canadensis: 13C and 2H labeling studies,"The biogenetic origin of the isoprenoid building blocks of the sesquiterpene germacrene D was studied in Solidago canadensis. Feeding experiments were carried out with 1-[5,5-d2]deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (D2-DOXP), [5-13C]mevalonolactone (13C-MVL) and [1-13C]-d-glucose. The hydrodistillate of a cut shoot fed with D2-DOXP was investigated by enantio-MDGC–MS and the volatile fraction of a shoot supplied with 13C-MVL was examined by GC–C–IRMS. The incorporation of [1-13C]-d-glucose was analyzed by quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy after isolation of germacrene D from the essential oil. Our labeling studies revealed that the biosynthesis of the C-15 skeleton of sesquiterpene germacrene D in Solidago canadensis proceeds predominantly via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway"
Sesquiterpene lactone engineering in microbial and plant platforms: parthenolide and artemisinin as case studies,"Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are one of the most diverse groups of secondary metabolites that mainly have been observed in the Asteraceae. They are composed of a C15 skeleton bearing functional groups, e.g., hydroxy, keto, or epoxy. Sesquiterpene lactones have been shown to display several biological activities; hence, their therapeutic effects are indispensable. To overcome low yield of sesquiterpene lactone content in native plants, manipulation of their biosynthetic pathway(s) has become an interesting approach for many researchers. Several genetic engineering strategies have been used in plants or microbial systems for elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway and high-level production of sesquiterpene lactones. Here, we will introduce ongoing research and perspectives about the manipulation of sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis by various non-traditional metabolic engineering strategies, along with successful examples of high-yield production of sesquiterpene lactones mainly focused on parthenolide and artemisinin in plants and microorganisms."
Involvement of compartmentalization in monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in plants,"Terpenoids play numerous vital roles in basic plant processes with volatile monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes contributing to plant defense and reproduction. The biosynthesis of terpenoids in plants occurs in different subcellular compartments, which until recently were believed to include the cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria. The plastidic MEP pathway and the cytosolic MVA pathway give rise to IPP and DMAPP, which are subsequently utilized by prenyltransferases to produce prenyl diphosphates. It has been accepted that GPP and monoterpenes are synthesized in plastids, whereas FPP and sesquiterpenes are produced in the cytosol. Here we discuss how compartmentalization contributes to the formation of terpenoid diversity in plants in light of recent reports on new subcellular localizations for some enzymatic steps as well as on bifunctional terpene synthases capable of producing both mono- and sesquiterpenes."
Terpenoid metabolism in wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis plants,"Volatile components, such as terpenoids, are emitted from aerial parts of plants and play a major role in the interaction between plants and their environment. Analysis of the composition and emission pattern of volatiles in the model plant Arabidopsis showed that a range of volatile components are released, primarily from flowers. Most of the volatiles detected were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which in contrast to other volatiles showed a diurnal emission pattern. The active terpenoid metabolism in wild-type Arabidopsis provoked us to conduct an additional set of experiments in which transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing two different terpene synthases were generated. Leaves of transgenic plants constitutively expressing a dual linalool/nerolidol synthase in the plastids (FaNES1) produced linalool and its glycosylated and hydroxylated derivatives. The sum of glycosylated components was in some of the transgenic lines up to 40- to 60-fold higher than the sum of the corresponding free alcohols. Surprisingly, we also detected the production and emission of nerolidol, albeit at a low level, suggesting that a small pool of its precursor farnesyl diphosphate is present in the plastids. Transgenic lines with strong transgene expression showed growth retardation, possibly as a result of the depletion of isoprenoid precursors in the plastids. In dual-choice assays with Myzus persicae, the FaNES1-expressing lines significantly repelled the aphids. Overexpression of a typical cytosolic sesquiterpene synthase resulted in the production of only trace amounts of the expected sesquiterpene, suggesting tight control of the cytosolic pool of farnesyl diphosphate, the precursor for sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. This study further demonstrates the value of Arabidopsis for studies of the biosynthesis and ecological role of terpenoids and provides new insights into their metabolism in wild-type and transgenic plants."
"Biosynthesis, function and metabolic engineering of plant volatile organic compounds","Plants synthesize an amazing diversity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that facilitate interactions with their environment, from attracting pollinators and seed dispersers to protecting themselves from pathogens, parasites and herbivores. Recent progress in -omics technologies resulted in the isolation of genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of many volatiles and contributed to our understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in VOC formation. In this review, we largely focus on the biosynthesis and regulation of plant volatiles, the involvement of floral volatiles in plant reproduction as well as their contribution to plant biodiversity and applications in agriculture via crop–pollinator interactions. In addition, metabolic engineering approaches for both the improvement of plant defense and pollinator attraction are discussed in light of methodological constraints and ecological complications that limit the transition of crops with modified volatile profiles from research laboratories to real-world implementation."
Biosynthesis of mono- and sesquiterpenes in carrot roots and leaves (Daucus carota L.): metabolic cross talk of cytosolic mevalonate and plastidial methylerythritol phosphate pathways,"The biosynthesis of the monoterpenes terpinolene and myrcene and the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene in roots and leaves of two carrot varieties (Daucus carota L. cultivars Bolero and Kazan) were investigated by in vivo feeding experiments with [5,5-2H2]-mevalonic acid lactone (d2-MVL) and [5,5-2H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose (d2-DOX). The volatiles of the tissues were extracted by stir bar sorptive extraction and analyzed using thermal desorption–multidimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The experiments demonstrate independent de novo-biosynthesis of terpenoids in carrot roots and in carrot leaves. In both plant tissues monoterpenes are biosynthesized exclusively via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose/2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathway, whereas sesquiterpenes are generated by the classical mevalonic acid pathway as well as by the DOXP/MEP route. A more detailed investigation of carrot root tissues revealed that the biosynthesis of terpenes is mainly localized in the phloem. Nevertheless, in xylem a de novo-biosynthesis of terpenes was detectable as well, even in the absence of oil ducts in this tissue."
Dynamic pathway allocation in early terpenoid biosynthesis of stress-induced lima bean leaves,"Two independent pathways contribute in higher plants to the formation of isopenteny1 diphosphate (IDP), the central building block of isoprenoids. In general, the cytosolic mevalonate pathway (MVA) provides the precursors for sesquiterpenes and sterols, whereas the plastidial methylerythritol pathway (MEP) furnishes the monoterpene-, diterpene- and carotenoids. Administration of deuterium labeled 1-deoxy-d-xylulose and mevalolactone to lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus), followed by gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric analysis of de novo produced volatiles revealed that the strict separation of both pathways does not exist. This could be confirmed by blocking the pathways individually with cerivastatin® (MVA) and fosmidomycin (MEP), respectively. Isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) at natural abundance levels demonstrated independently and without the need for labeled precursors a dynamic allocation of the MVA- or the MEP-pathway in the biosynthesis of the nerolidol-derived homoterpene 4,8-dimethy1-nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT). Insect-feeding upregulated predominantly the MVA-pathway, while the fungal elicitor alamethicin stimulated the biosynthesis of DMNT via the MEP-pathway."
Functional characterization of sesquiterpene synthase from Polygonum minus,"Polygonum minus is an aromatic plant, which contains high abundance of terpenoids, especially the sesquiterpenes C15H24. Sesquiterpenes were believed to contribute to the many useful biological properties in plants. This study aimed to functionally characterize a full length sesquiterpene synthase gene from P. minus. P. minus sesquiterpene synthase (PmSTS) has a complete open reading frame (ORF) of 1689 base pairs encoding a 562 amino acid protein. Similar to other sesquiterpene synthases, PmSTS has two large domains: the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal metal-binding domain. It also consists of three conserved motifs: the DDXXD, NSE/DTE, and RXR. A three-dimensional protein model for PmSTS built clearly distinguished the two main domains, where conserved motifs were highlighted. We also constructed a phylogenetic tree, which showed that PmSTS belongs to the angiosperm sesquiterpene synthase subfamily Tps-a. To examine the function of PmSTS, we expressed this gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. Two transgenic lines, designated as OE3 and OE7, were further characterized, both molecularly and functionally. The transgenic plants demonstrated smaller basal rosette leaves, shorter and fewer flowering stems, and fewer seeds compared to wild type plants. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the transgenic plants showed that PmSTS was responsible for the production of β-sesquiphellandrene."
Monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in glandular trichomes of peppermint (Mentha x piperita) rely exclusively on plastid-derived isopentenyl diphosphate,"The subcellular compartmentation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) synthesis was examined in secretory cells isolated from glandular trichomes of peppermint (Mentha x piperita L. cv. Black Mitcham). As a consequence of their anatomy and the conditions of their isolation, the isolated secretory cells are non-specifically permeable to low-molecular-weight water-soluble metabolites. Thus, the cytoplasm is readily accessible to the exogenous buffer whereas the selective permeability of subcellular organelles is maintained. With the appropriate choice of exogenous substrates, this feature allows the assessment of cytoplasmic and organellar (e.g. plastidic) metabolism in situ. Glycolytic substrates such as [14C]glucose-6-phosphate and [14C]pyruvic acid are incorporated into both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes with a monoterpene:sesquiterpene ratio that closely mimics that observed in vivo, indicating that the correct subcellular partitioning of these substrates is maintained in this model system. Additionally, exogenous [14C]mevalonic acid and [14C]IPP, which are both intitially metabolized in the cytoplasm, produce an abnormally high proportion of sesquiterpenes. In contrast, incubation with either [14C]citrate or [14C]acetyl-CoA results in the accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) with no detectable isoprenoids formed. Taken together, these results indicate that the cytoplasmic mevalonic acid pathway is blocked at HMG-CoA reductase and that the IPP utilized for both monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis is synthesized exclusively in the plastids."
"Diversity, regulation, and genetic manipulation of plant mono-and sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis","Among plant secondary metabolites, terpenoids are the most abundant and structurally diverse group. In addition to their important roles in pollinator attraction and direct and indirect plant defense, terpenoids are also commercially valuable due to their broad applications in the cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Because of their functional versatility and wide distribution, great efforts have been made to decipher terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, to investigate the molecular mechanism determining their structural diversity, and to understand their biosynthetic regulation. Recent progress on the manipulation of terpenoid production in transgenic plants not only holds considerable promise for improving various plant traits and crop protection but also increases our understanding of the significance of terpenoid metabolites in mediating plant-environment interactions."
A raison d'être for two distinct pathways in the early steps of plant isoprenoid biosynthesis?,"When compared to other organisms, plants are atypical with respect to isoprenoid biosynthesis: they utilize two distinct and separately compartmentalized pathways to build up isoprene units. The co-existence of these pathways in the cytosol and in plastids might permit the synthesis of many vital compounds, being essential for a sessile organism. While substrate exchange across membranes has been shown for a variety of plant species, lack of complementation of strong phenotypes, resulting from inactivation of either the cytosolic pathway (growth and development defects) or the plastidial pathway (pigment bleaching), seems to be surprising at first sight. Hundreds of isoprenoids have been analyzed to determine their biosynthetic origins. It can be concluded that in angiosperms, under standard growth conditions, C20-phytyl moieties, C30-triterpenes and C40-carotenoids are made nearly exclusively within compartmentalized pathways, while mixed origins are widespread for other types of isoprenoid-derived molecules. It seems likely that this coexistence is essential for the interaction of plants with their environment. A major purpose of this review is to summarize such observations, especially within an ecological and functional context and with some emphasis on regulation. This latter aspect still requires more work and present conclusions are preliminary, although some general features seem to exist."
"Volatile terpenoids: multiple functions, biosynthesis, modulation and manipulation by genetic engineering","Terpenoids are structurally diverse and the most abundant plant secondary metabolites, playing an important role in plant life through direct and indirect plant defenses, by attracting pollinators and through different interactions between the plants and their environment. Terpenoids are also significant because of their enormous applications in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics industries. Due to their broad distribution and functional versatility, efforts are being made to decode the biosynthetic pathways and comprehend the regulatory mechanisms of terpenoids. This review summarizes the recent advances in biosynthetic pathways, including the spatiotemporal, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, we discuss the multiple functions of the terpene synthase genes (TPS), their interaction with the surrounding environment and the use of genetic engineering for terpenoid production in model plants. Here, we also provide an overview of the significance of terpenoid metabolic engineering in crop protection, plant reproduction and plant metabolic engineering approaches for pharmaceutical terpenoids production and future scenarios in agriculture, which call for sustainable production platforms by improving different plant traits."
Strategies for transgenic manipulation of monoterpene biosynthesis in plants,"Monoterpenes, the C10 isoprenoids, are a large family of natural products that are best known as constituents of the essential oils and defensive oleoresins of aromatic plants. In addition to ecological roles in pollinator attraction, allelopathy and plant defense, monoterpenes are used extensively in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. The importance of these plant products has prompted the definition of many monoterpene biosynthetic pathways, the cloning of the relevant genes and the development of genetic transformation techniques for agronomically significant monoterpene-producing plants. Metabolic engineering of monoterpene biosynthesis in the model plant peppermint has resulted in yield increase and compositional improvement of the essential oil, and also provided strategies for manipulating flavor and fragrance production, and plant defense."
Plant terpenoids: biosynthesis and ecological functions,"Among plant secondary metabolites terpenoids are a structurally most diverse group; they function as phytoalex-ins in plant direct defense, or as signals in indirect defense responses which involves herbivores and their natural enemies. In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the investigation of the ecological role of plant terpenoids. The biosynthesis pathways of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes include the synthesis of C5 precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the synthesis of the immediate diphosphate precursors, and the formation of the diverse terpenoids. Terpene synthases (TPSs) play a key role in volatile terpene synthesis. By expression of the TPS genes, significant achievements have been made on metabolic engineering to increase terpenoid production. This review mainly summarizes the recent research progress in elucidating the ecological role of terpenoids and characterization of the enzymes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis. Spatial and temporal regulations of terpenoids metabolism are also discussed."
"Germacrene A synthase in yarrow (Achillea millefolium) is an enzyme with mixed substrate specificity: gene cloning, functional characterization and expression analysis","Terpenoid synthases constitute a highly diverse gene family producing a wide range of cyclic and acyclic molecules consisting of isoprene (C5) residues. Often a single terpene synthase produces a spectrum of molecules of given chain length, but some terpene synthases can use multiple substrates, producing products of different chain length. Only a few such enzymes has been characterized, but the capacity for multiple-substrate use can be more widespread than previously thought. Here we focused on germacrene A synthase (GAS) that is a key cytosolic enzyme in the sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis pathway in the important medicinal plant Achillea millefolium (AmGAS). The full length encoding gene was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), functionally characterized, and its in vivo expression was analyzed. The recombinant protein catalyzed formation of germacrene A with the C15 substrate farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), while acyclic monoterpenes were formed with the C10 substrate geranyl diphosphate (GDP) and cyclic monoterpenes with the C10 substrate neryl diphosphate (NDP). Although monoterpene synthesis has been assumed to be confined exclusively to plastids, AmGAS can potentially synthesize monoterpenes in cytosol when GDP or NDP become available. AmGAS enzyme had high homology with GAS sequences from other Asteraceae species, suggesting that multi-substrate use can be more widespread among germacrene A synthases than previously thought. Expression studies indicated that AmGAS was expressed in both autotrophic and heterotrophic plant compartments with the highest expression levels in leaves and flowers. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the cloning and characterization of germacrene A synthase coding gene in A. millefolium, and multi-substrate use of GAS enzymes."
Metabolic engineering of natural products in plants; tools of the trade and challenges for the future,"Plant natural products play essential roles in plant survivability and many of them are used as nutrients, colorants, flavors, fragrances, and medicines. Genetic engineering of plants for natural products can help alleviate the demands for limited natural resources. Successes in enhancing production capacities have included manipulating blocks of genes coding for segments of pathways, over-expression of putative rate-limiting steps in pathways, expression of transcription factors regulating the entire metabolic pathways, and the construction of novel branch pathways capable of diverting carbon to the biosynthesis of unique metabolites in unexpected intracellular compartments. Further enhancements are likely if more efficient pathways can be constructed, providing for the efficient channeling of intermediates to final products, and if the means for sequestering natural products in planta can be accomplished."
Two independent biochemical pathways for isopentenyl diphosphate and isoprenoid biosynthesis in higher plants,"In the early times of isoprenoid research, a single pathway was found for the formation of the C5 monomer, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), and this acetate/mevalonate pathway was supposed to occur ubiquitously in all living organisms. Now, 40 years later, a totally different IPP biosynthesis route has been detected in eubacteria, green algae and higher plants. In this new pathway glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate are precursors of isopentenyl diphosphate, but not acetyl-CoA and mevalonic acid. In green tissues of three higher plants it was shown that all chloroplastbound isoprenoids (β-carotene, phytyl chains of chlorophylls and nona-prenyl chain of plastoquinone-9) are formed via the GAP/pyruvate pathway, whereas the cytoplasmic sterols are formed via the acetate/mevalonate pathway. Also, isoprene, emitted by various plants at high light conditions by action of the plastid-bound isoprene synthase, is formed via the new GAP/pyruvate pathway. Thus, in higher plants, there exist two separate and biochemically different IPP biosynthesis pathways: (1) the novel alternative GAP/pyruvate pathway apparently bound to the plastidic compartment and (2) the classical cytoplasmic acetate/mevalonate pathway. This new GAP/pyruvate pathway for IPP formation allows a reasonable interpretation of previous odd results concerning the biosynthesis of chloroplast isoprenoids, which, so far, had mainly been interpreted assuming compartmentation differences. The novel GAP/pyruvate pathway for IPP formation in plastids appears as a heritage of their prokaryotic, endosymbiotic ancestors."
"Terpenoid biosynthesis: the basic pathway and formation of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes","Plants produce a large variety of lipids that lack fatty acid moieties and are often called nonacyl lipids. The largest single category of nonacyl lipids in higher plants is undoubtedly the terpenoids, an extremely abundant class of natural products with a common biosynthetic origin. Terpenoids all share a common construction pattern: the linkage of five- carbon units having the branched carbon skeleton of isopentane. Terpenoids are found in all living organisms, but achieve their greatest structural and functional diversity in the plant kingdom. This chapter considers each of the three stages of terpenoid biosynthesis, such as, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes. It describes the sequence of biosynthetic transformations of each stage and reviews what is known about the enzymology, mechanism, and regulation of various key steps of the pathway. The chapter examines the roles of subcellular compartmentation, multienzyme complexes, assimilate partitioning, and morphological differentiation in the overall control of plant terpenoid biogenesis."
Advances in fruit aroma volatile research,"Fruits produce a range of volatile compounds that make up their characteristic aromas and contribute to their flavor. Fruit volatile compounds are mainly comprised of esters, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, terpenoids and apocarotenoids. Many factors affect volatile composition, including the genetic makeup, degree of maturity, environmental conditions, postharvest handling and storage. There are several pathways involved in volatile biosynthesis starting from lipids, amino acids, terpenoids and carotenoids. Once the basic skeletons are produced via these pathways, the diversity of volatiles is achieved via additional modification reactions such as acylation, methylation, oxidation/reduction and cyclic ring closure. In this paper, we review the composition of fruit aroma, the characteristic aroma compounds of several representative fruits, the factors affecting aroma volatile, and the biosynthetic pathways of volatile aroma compounds. We anticipate that this review would provide some critical information for profound research on fruit aroma components and their manipulation during development and storage"
Engineering the plant rhizosphere,"Plant natural products are low molecular weight compounds playing important roles in plant survival under biotic and abiotic stresses. In the rhizosphere, several groups of plant natural products function as semiochemicals that mediate the interactions of plants with other plants, animals and microorganisms. The knowledge on the biosynthesis and transport of these signaling molecules is increasing fast. This enables us to consider to optimize plant performance by changing the production of these signaling molecules or their exudation into the rhizosphere. Here we discuss recent advances in the understanding and metabolic engineering of these rhizosphere semiochemicals."
Overproduction of isoprenoids by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a synthetic grape juice medium in the absence of plant genes,"The objective of this work is to demonstrate if the hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase Coq1p might be involved in monoterpenes synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although its currently known function in yeast is to catalyze the first step in ubiquinone biosynthesis. However, in a BY4743 laboratory strain, the presence of an empty plasmid in a chemically defined grape juice medium results in a statistically significant increase of linalool, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol. When COQ1 is overexpressed from a plasmid, the levels of the volatile isoprenoids are further increased. Furthermore, overexpression of COQ1 in the same genetic context but with a mutated farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (erg20 mutation K197E), results in statistically significant higher levels of linalool (above 750 μg/L), geraniol, α-terpineol, and the sesquiterpenes, farnesol and nerolidol (total concentration of volatile isoprenoids surpasses 1300 μg/L). We show that the levels of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that S. cerevisiae can produce, in the absence of plant genes, depend on the composition of the medium and the genetic context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest level of linalool produced by S. cerevisiae up to now. Further research will be needed for understanding how COQ1 and the medium composition might interact to increase flavor complexity of fermented beverages."
Biosynthesis and engineering of isoprenoid small molecules,"Isoprenoid secondary metabolites are a rich source of commercial products that have not been fully explored. At present, there are isoprenoid products used in cancer therapy, the treatment of infectious diseases, and crop protection. All isoprenoids share universal prenyl diphosphate precursors synthesized via two distinct pathways. From these universal precursors, the biosynthetic pathways to specific isoprenoids diverge resulting in a staggering array of products. Taking advantage of this diversity has been the focus of much effort in metabolic engineering heterologous hosts. In addition, the engineering of the mevalonate pathway has increased levels of the universal precursors available for heterologous production. Finally, we will describe the efforts to produce to commercial terpenoids, paclitaxel and artemisinin."
The non-mevalonate DOXP/MEP (deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate/methylerythritol 4-phosphate) pathway of chloroplast isoprenoid and pigment biosynthesis,"The plastidic pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and isoprenoid biosynthesis, the DOXP/MEP pathway, possesses an essential function in the biosynthesis of thylakoidal prenylllipids chlorophylls (phytyl side-chain), carotenoids, plastoquinone-9, phylloquinone K1 and α-tocopherol, as well as for monoterpenes and diterpenes. Here we review its detection, its enzymes, intermediates, genes, cofactor requirements and inhibitors. This plastidic isoprenoid pathway is also contrasted against the acetate/mevalonate(MVA) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis operating in the cytosol for the biosynthesis of sterols, sesquiterpenes and polyterpenes. The DOXP/MEP pathway can specifically be inhibited by fosmidomycin and the acetate/MVA pathway by statins (e.g. mevinolin). By applying specifically marked substrates (2H-deoxyxylulose, 14C-DOXP, 3H-MVA or 14C-MVA) and specific inhibitors a cross-talk between both IPP yielding cell pathways was detected that operates preferentially in the chloroplast-to-cytosol direction. The DOXP/MEP pathway is also involved in the biosynthesis of the volatile hemiterpenes isoprene and methylbutenol. The distribution of the DOXP/MEP pathway in photosynthetic organisms (bacteria, algae, higher plants) and its putative origin in anoxigenic photosynthetic bacteria is reviewed. The DOXP/MEP pathway does not occur in Archaea, fungi or animals. The use of etiolated seedlings with their light-induced pigment accumulation as a test system for inhibitors of the DOXP/MEP pathway in the search of active ingredients against pathogenic bacteria and the malaria parasite Plasmodium is discussed."
"The Sesquiterpenes(E)-ß-Farnesene and (E)-α-Bergamotene Quench Ozone but Fail to Protect the Wild Tobacco Nicotiana attenuata from Ozone, UVB, and Drought Stresses","Among the terpenes, isoprene (C5) and monoterpene hydrocarbons (C10) have been shown to ameliorate abiotic stress in a number of plant species via two proposed mechanisms: membrane stabilization and direct antioxidant effects. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (C15) not only share the structural properties thought to lend protective qualities to isoprene and monoterpene hydrocarbons, but also react rapidly with ozone, suggesting that sesquiterpenes may similarly enhance tolerance of abiotic stresses. To test whether sesquiterpenes protect plants against ozone, UVB light, or drought, we used transgenic lines of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata. The transgenic plants expressed a maize terpene synthase gene (ZmTPS10) which produced a blend of (E)-ß-farnesene and (E)-α-bergamotene, or a point mutant of the same gene (ZmTPS10M) which produced (E)-ß-farnesene alone,. (E)-ß-farnesene exerted a local, external, and transient ozone-quenching effect in ozone-fumigated chambers, but we found no evidence that enhanced sesquiterpene production by the plant inhibited oxidative damage, or maintained photosynthetic function or plant fitness under acute or chronic stress. Although the sesquiterpenes (E)-ß-farnesene and (E)-α-bergamotene might confer benefits under intermittent heat stress, which was not tested, any roles in relieving abiotic stress may be secondary to their previously demonstrated functions in biotic interactions."
Rice terpene synthase 20 (OsTPS20) plays an important role in producing terpene volatiles in response to abiotic stresses,"This study examined the volatile terpenes produced by rice seedlings in response to oxidative stress induced by various abiotic factors. Solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME–GC–MS) analyses revealed that when exposed to UV-B radiation, rice seedlings emitted a bouquet of monoterpene mixtures in a time-dependent manner. The mixtures comprised limonene, sabinene, myrcene, α-terpinene, β-ocimene, γ-terpinene, and α-terpinolene. Among them, (S)-limonene was the most abundant volatile, discriminated by chiral SPME–GC–MS. The volatile profiles collected from rice plants treated with both γ-irradiation and H2O2 were identical to those observed in the UV-B irradiated plants, thus indicating that the volatile mixtures were specifically produced in response to oxidative stress, particularly in the presence of H2O2. Using a reverse genetics approach, we isolated full-length rice terpene synthase 20 (OsTPS20, 599 amino acids, 69.39 kDa), which was further characterized as an (S)-limonene synthase by removing the N-terminal signal peptide (63 amino acids) of the protein. The recombinant OsTPS20 protein catalyzed the conversion of geranyl diphosphate to (S)-limonene and other minor monoterpenes, essentially covering all of the volatile compounds detected from the plant. Moreover, qRT-PCR revealed that the transcript levels of OsTPS20 were significantly induced in response to oxidative stress, thereby suggesting that OsTPS20 plays a major role in producing terpene volatiles during abiotic stress. Detailed biochemical analyses and the unusual domain characteristics of OsTPS20 are also discussed in this report."
"Mild versus severe stress and BVOCs: thresholds, priming and consequences","Plant-generated volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) play key roles in large-scale atmospheric processes and serve the plants as important defense and signal molecules. The main emphasis in quantitative BVOC studies has been on constitutive emissions of isoprene and specific monoterpene species that are present in only certain emitting plant species. However, environmental and biotic stresses can induce emissions of an array of organic compounds in any plant species, whereas the magnitude of emissions induced by given stress depends on stress tolerance, timing, duration and severity (mild versus strong) of the stress. The main view put forward in this review is that quantitative understanding of stress effects is the key for constructing realistic models of both constitutive and induced BVOC emissions."
Studies on biosynthetic genes and enzymes of isoprenoids produced by actinomycetes,"Most Streptomyces strains are equipped with only the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway for the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate, a common precursor of isoprenoids. In addition to this pathway, some Streptomyces strains possess the mevalonate (MV) pathway via which isoprenoid antibiotics are produced. We have recently cloned and analyzed the MV pathway gene clusters and their flanking regions from terpentecin, BE-40644, and furaquinocin A producers. All these clusters contained genes coding for mevalonate kinase, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase, phosphomevalonate kinase, type 2 IPP isomerase, HMG-CoA reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase. The order of each of the open reading frames (ORFs) is also the same, and the respective homologous ORFs show more than 70% amino acid identity with each other. In contrast to these conservative gene organizations, the biosynthetic genes of terpentecin, BE-40644, and furaquinocin A were located just upstream and/or downstream of the MV pathway gene cluster. These facts suggested that all the actinomycete strains possessing both the MV and MEP pathways produce isoprenoid compounds and the biosynthetic genes of one of these isoprenoids usually exist adjacent to the MV pathway gene cluster. Therefore, when the presence of the MV cluster is detected by molecular genetic techniques, isoprenoids may be produced by the cultivation of these actinomycete strains. During the course of these studies, we identified diterpene cyclases possessing unique primary structures that differ from those of eukaryotes and catalyze unique reactions."
The potential of the mevalonate pathway for enhanced isoprenoid production,"The cytosol-localised mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway delivers the basic isoprene unit isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). In higher plants, this central metabolic intermediate is also synthesised by the plastid-localised methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Both MVA and MEP pathways conspire through exchange of intermediates and regulatory interactions. Products downstream of IPP such as phytosterols, carotenoids, vitamin E, artemisinin, tanshinone and paclitaxel demonstrate antioxidant, cholesterol-reducing, anti-ageing, anticancer, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. Other isoprenoid precursors including isoprene, isoprenol, geraniol, farnesene and farnesol are economically valuable. An update on the MVA pathway and its interaction with the MEP pathway is presented, including the improvement in the production of phytosterols and other isoprenoid derivatives. Such attempts are for instance based on the bioengineering of microbes such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as plants. The function of relevant genes in the MVA pathway that can be utilised in metabolic engineering is reviewed and future perspectives are presented."
Opportunistic emissions of volatile isoprenoids,"Isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are synthesized and emitted by some plant species, but not all plant species have this ability. These volatile, nonessential isoprenoid compounds share the same biochemical precursors as larger essential isoprenoids such as gibberellic acids and carotenoids. They have many protective and ecological functions for the plant species that produce them, but plant species that do not produce these compounds also grow and reproduce successfully. Here, we develop an ‘opportunist hypothesis’ suggesting that (i) volatile isoprenoid production takes advantage of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which are synthesized primarily to produce essential isoprenoids, and (ii) conditions affecting synthesis of the higher isoprenoids will affect the production and emission of volatile isoprenoids."
Isoprene interferes with the attraction of bodyguards by herbaceous plants,"Isoprene is the most abundant volatile compound emitted by vegetation. It influences air chemistry and is part of plant defense against abiotic stresses. However, whether isoprene influences biotic interactions between plants and other organisms has not been investigated to date. Here we show a new effect of isoprene, namely its influence on interactions between plants and insects. Herbivory induces the release of plant volatiles that attract the herbivore's enemies, such as parasitic wasps, as a kind of bodyguard. We used transgenic isoprene-emitting Arabidopsis plants in behavioral, chemical, and electrophysiological studies to investigate the effects of isoprene on ecological interactions in 2 tritrophic systems. We demonstrate that isoprene is perceived by the chemoreceptors of the parasitic wasp Diadegma semiclausum and interferes with the attraction of this parasitic wasp to volatiles from herbivore-infested plants. We verified this repellent effect on D. semiclausum female wasps by adding external isoprene to the volatile blend of wild-type plants. In contrast, the antennae of the parasitic wasp Cotesia rubecula do not perceive isoprene and the behavior of this wasp was not altered by isoprene emission. In addition, the performance of the 2 examined lepidopteran herbivores (Pieris rapae and Plutella xylostella) was not affected by isoprene emission. Therefore, attraction of parasitic wasps to host-infested herbaceous plants in the neighborhood of high isoprene emitters, such as poplar or willow, may be hampered by the isoprene emission that repels plant bodyguards."
Isoprenoids: an evolutionary pool for photoprotection,"Plants have evolved several mechanisms for getting rid of excess energy in photosynthetic membranes, some of which involve isoprenoid compounds. In all photosynthetic organisms, the carotenoids β-carotene and zeaxanthin, and tocopherols serve an important photoprotective role, either by dissipating excess excitation energy as heat or by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppressing lipid peroxidation. Isoprene and some monoterpenes, diterpenes and other carotenoids also occur in some plant lineages. Compelling evidence indicates that these non-ubiquitous isoprenoids might be particularly relevant in adapting plants to adverse climatic conditions by serving as additional and/or alternative protection mechanisms."
Contribution of isopentenyl phosphate to plant terpenoid metabolism,"Plant genomes encode isopentenyl phosphate kinases (IPKs) that reactivate isopentenyl phosphate (IP) via ATP-dependent phosphorylation, forming the primary metabolite isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) used generally for isoprenoid/terpenoid biosynthesis. Therefore, the existence of IPKs in plants raises unanswered questions concerning the origin and regulatory roles of IP in plant terpenoid metabolism. Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence showing that IP forms during specific dephosphorylation of IPP catalysed by a subset of Nudix superfamily hydrolases. Increasing metabolically available IP by overexpression of a bacterial phosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MPD) in Nicotiana tabacum resulted in significant enhancement in both monoterpene and sesquiterpene production. These results indicate that perturbing IP metabolism results in measurable changes in terpene products derived from both the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and mevalonate (MVA) pathways. Moreover, the unpredicted peroxisomal localization of bacterial MPD led us to discover that the step catalysed by phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) imposes a hidden constraint on flux through the classical MVA pathway. These complementary findings fundamentally alter conventional views of metabolic regulation of terpenoid metabolism in plants and provide new metabolic engineering targets for the production of high-value terpenes in plants"
