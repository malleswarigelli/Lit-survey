0,"‘Hidden’ Terpenoids in Plants: Their Biosynthesis, Localization and Ecological Roles","Terpenoids are the largest group of plant specialized (secondary) metabolites. These naturally occurring chemical compounds are highly diverse in chemical structure. Although there have been many excellent studies of terpenoids, most have focused on compounds built solely of isoprene units. Plants, however, also contain many ‘atypical’ terpenoids, such as glycosylated volatile terpenes and composite-type terpenoids, the latter of which are synthesized by the coupling of isoprene units on aromatic compounds. This mini review describes these ‘hidden’ terpenoids, providing an overview of their biosynthesis, localization, and biological and ecological activities.",terpenoids largest group plant specialized secondary metabolite these naturally occurring chemical compound highly diverse chemical structure although many excellent study terpenoids focused compound built solely isoprene unit plants however also contain many atypical terpenoids glycosylated volatile terpene composite type terpenoids latter synthesized coupling isoprene unit aromatic compound this mini review describes hidden terpenoids providing overview biosynthesis localization biological ecological activity,medium
1,A modern purification method for volatile sesquiterpenes produced by recombinant Escherichia coli carrying terpene synthase genes,"Most volatile sesquiterpenes had been purified from plants using distillation and preparative gas chromatography, which is not applicable to many laboratories that do not possess a needed facility. Thus, this review focuses on a modern purification method for volatile sesquiterpenes using Escherichia coli cells that functionally express terpene synthase (Tps) genes. It was recently developed that recombinant E. coli cells carrying Tps genes were cultured in two-layer media (n-octane/TB medium) without harming the cells, and the volatile hydrophobic compounds trapped in the n-octane were purified by two-phase partition (alkane/alkaline 50% MeOH), silica gel column chromatography, and reversed-phase preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (if necessary). Consequently, it was found that the volatile sesquiterpenes are easily purified, the structures of which can then be determined by nuclear magnetic resonance, [a]D and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses. The antioxidant activities of several volatile sesquiterpenes are also presented in this review.",most volatile sesquiterpenes purified plant using distillation preparative gas chromatography applicable many laboratory posse needed facility thus review focus modern purification method volatile sesquiterpenes using escherichia coli cell functionally express terpene synthase tps gene it recently developed recombinant e coli cell carrying tps gene cultured two layer medium n octane tb medium without harming cell volatile hydrophobic compound trapped n octane purified two phase partition alkane alkaline meoh silica gel column chromatography reversed phase preparative high performance liquid chromatography necessary consequently found volatile sesquiterpenes easily purified structure determined nuclear magnetic resonance d gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis the antioxidant activity several volatile sesquiterpenes also presented review,low
2,"A Novel Pathway for Sesquiterpene Biosynthesis from Z,Z-Farnesyl Pyrophosphate in the Wild Tomato Solanum habrochaites  ","In the wild tomato Solanum habrochaites, the Sst2 locus on chromosome 8 is responsible for the biosynthesis of several class II sesquiterpene olefins by glandular trichomes. Analysis of a trichome-specific EST collection from S. habrochaites revealed two candidate genes for the synthesis of Sst2-associated sesquiterpenes. zFPS encodes a protein with homology to Z-isoprenyl pyrophosphate synthases and SBS (for Santalene and Bergamotene Synthase) encodes a terpene synthase with homology to kaurene synthases. Both genes were found to cosegregate with the Sst2 locus. Recombinant zFPS protein catalyzed the synthesis of Z,Z-FPP from isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP), while coincubation of zFPS and SBS with the same substrates yielded a mixture of olefins identical to the Sst2-associated sesquiterpenes, including (+)-a-santalene, (+)-endo-ß-bergamotene, and (-)-endo-a-bergamotene. In addition, headspace analysis of tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris) plants expressing zFPS and SBS in glandular trichomes afforded the same mix of sesquiterpenes. Each of these proteins contains a putative plastid targeting sequence that mediates transport of a fused green fluorescent protein to the chloroplasts, suggesting that the biosynthesis of these sesquiterpenes uses IPP and DMAPP from the plastidic DXP pathway. These results provide novel insights into sesquiterpene biosynthesis and have general implications concerning sesquiterpene engineering in plants.",in wild tomato solanum habrochaites sst locus chromosome responsible biosynthesis several class ii sesquiterpene olefin glandular trichomes analysis trichome specific est collection s habrochaites revealed two candidate gene synthesis sst associated sesquiterpenes zfps encodes protein homology z isoprenyl pyrophosphate synthases sbs santalene bergamotene synthase encodes terpene synthase homology kaurene synthases both gene found cosegregate sst locus recombinant zfps protein catalyzed synthesis z z fpp isopentenylpyrophosphate ipp dimethylallylpyrophosphate dmapp coincubation zfps sbs substrate yielded mixture olefin identical sst associated sesquiterpenes including santalene endo bergamotene endo bergamotene in addition headspace analysis tobacco nicotiana sylvestris plant expressing zfps sbs glandular trichomes afforded mix sesquiterpenes each protein contains putative plastid targeting sequence mediates transport fused green fluorescent protein chloroplast suggesting biosynthesis sesquiterpenes us ipp dmapp plastidic dxp pathway these result provide novel insight sesquiterpene biosynthesis general implication concerning sesquiterpene engineering plant,low
3,"A Promiscuous CYP706A3 Reduces Terpene Volatile Emission from Arabidopsis Flowers, Affecting Florivores and the Floral Microbiome","Flowers are essential but vulnerable plant organs, exposed to pollinators and florivores; however, flower chemical defenses are rarely investigated. We show here that two clustered terpene synthase and cytochrome P450 encoding genes (TPS11 and CYP706A3) on chromosome 5 of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) are tightly coexpressed in floral tissues, upon anthesis and during floral bud development. TPS11 was previously reported to generate a blend of sesquiterpenes. By heterologous coexpression of TPS11 and CYP706A3 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Nicotiana benthamiana, we demonstrate that CYP706A3 is active on TPS11 products and also further oxidizes its own primary oxidation products. Analysis of headspace and soluble metabolites in cyp706a3 and 35S:CYP706A3 mutants indicate that CYP706A3-mediated metabolism largely suppresses sesquiterpene and most monoterpene emissions from opening flowers, and generates terpene oxides that are retained in floral tissues. In flower buds, the combined expression of TPS11 and CYP706A3 also suppresses volatile emissions and generates soluble sesquiterpene oxides. Florivory assays with the Brassicaceae specialist Plutella xylostella demonstrate that insect larvae avoid feeding on buds expressing CYP706A3 and accumulating terpene oxides. Composition of the floral microbiome appears also to be modulated by CYP706A3 expression. TPS11 and CYP706A3 simultaneously evolved within Brassicaceae and form the most versatile functional gene cluster described in higher plants so far.",flowers essential vulnerable plant organ exposed pollinator florivores however flower chemical defense rarely investigated we show two clustered terpene synthase cytochrome p encoding gene tps cyp a chromosome arabidopsis arabidopsis thaliana tightly coexpressed floral tissue upon anthesis floral bud development tps previously reported generate blend sesquiterpenes by heterologous coexpression tps cyp a yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae nicotiana benthamiana demonstrate cyp a active tps product also oxidizes primary oxidation product analysis headspace soluble metabolite cyp s cyp a mutant indicate cyp a mediated metabolism largely suppresses sesquiterpene monoterpene emission opening flower generates terpene oxide retained floral tissue in flower bud combined expression tps cyp a also suppresses volatile emission generates soluble sesquiterpene oxide florivory assay brassicaceae specialist plutella xylostella demonstrate insect larva avoid feeding bud expressing cyp a accumulating terpene oxide composition floral microbiome appears also modulated cyp a expression tps cyp a simultaneously evolved within brassicaceae form versatile functional gene cluster described higher plant far,low
4,Antisense Suppression of a (+)-d-Cadinene Synthase Gene in Cotton Prevents the Induction of This Defense Response Gene during Bacterial Blight Infection But Not Its Constitutive Expression  ,"In cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) the enzyme (+)-d-cadinene synthase (CDNS) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of cadinane-type sesquiterpenes, such as gossypol, that provide constitutive and inducible protection against pests and diseases. A cotton cDNA clone encoding CDNS (cdn1-C4) was isolated from developing embryos and functionally characterized. Southern analysis showed that CDNS genes belong to a large multigene family, of which five genomic clones were studied, including three pseudogenes and one gene that may represent another subfamily of CDNS. CDNS expression was shown to be induced in cotton infected with either the bacterial blight or verticillium wilt pathogens. Constructs for the constitutive or seed-specific antisense suppression of cdn1-C4 were introduced into cotton by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Gossypol levels were not reduced in the seeds of transformants with either construct, nor was the induction of CDNS expression affected in stems of the constitutive antisense plants infected with Verticillium dahliae Kleb. However, the induction of CDNS mRNA and protein in response to bacterial blight infection of cotyledons was completely blocked in the constitutive antisense plants. These results suggest that cdn1-C4 may be involved specifically in the bacterial blight response and that the CDNS multigene family comprises a complex set of genes differing in their temporal and spatial regulation and responsible for different branches of the cotton sesquiterpene pathway.",in cotton gossypium hirsutum enzyme cadinene synthase cdns catalyzes first committed step biosynthesis cadinane type sesquiterpenes gossypol provide constitutive inducible protection pest disease a cotton cdna clone encoding cdns cdn c isolated developing embryo functionally characterized southern analysis showed cdns gene belong large multigene family five genomic clone studied including three pseudogenes one gene may represent another subfamily cdns cdns expression shown induced cotton infected either bacterial blight verticillium wilt pathogen constructs constitutive seed specific antisense suppression cdn c introduced cotton agrobacterium mediated transformation gossypol level reduced seed transformants either construct induction cdns expression affected stem constitutive antisense plant infected verticillium dahliae kleb however induction cdns mrna protein response bacterial blight infection cotyledon completely blocked constitutive antisense plant these result suggest cdn c may involved specifically bacterial blight response cdns multigene family comprises complex set gene differing temporal spatial regulation responsible different branch cotton sesquiterpene pathway,low
5,Aphid-repellent pheromone E-ß-farnesene is generated in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana over-expressing farnesyl diphosphate synthase2,"Background and Aims Plant-synthesized sesquiterpenes play a pivotal role in chemotactic interactions with insects. Biosynthesis of functionally diverse sesquiterpenes is dependent on the availability of a pool of the precursor farnesyldiphosphate (FDP). In Arabidopsis thaliana, FPS2, encoding cytosolic farnesyldiphosphate synthase, is implicated in the synthesis of cytosolic FDP, but it is not known whether enhanced levels of FDP have a commensurate effect on sesquiterpene-mediated defence responses. This study examined transgenic arabidopsis plants generated to over-express FPS2 in order to determine if any effects could be observed in the response of aphids, Myzus persicae.",background aims plant synthesized sesquiterpenes play pivotal role chemotactic interaction insect biosynthesis functionally diverse sesquiterpenes dependent availability pool precursor farnesyldiphosphate fdp in arabidopsis thaliana fps encoding cytosolic farnesyldiphosphate synthase implicated synthesis cytosolic fdp known whether enhanced level fdp commensurate effect sesquiterpene mediated defence response this study examined transgenic arabidopsis plant generated express fps order determine effect could observed response aphid myzus persicae,medium
6,Biosynthesis and Emission of Terpenoid Volatiles from Arabidopsis Flowers ,"Arabidopsis is believed to be mostly self-pollinated, although several lines of genetic and morphological evidence indicate that insect-mediated outcrossing occurs with at least a low frequency in wild populations. Here, we show that Arabidopsis flowers emit both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, potential olfactory cues for pollinating insects. Of the 32 terpene synthase genes in the Arabidopsis genome, 20 were found to be expressed in flowers, 6 of these exclusively or almost exclusively so. Two terpene synthase genes expressed exclusively in the flowers and one terpene synthase gene expressed almost exclusively in the flowers were characterized and found to encode proteins that catalyze the formation of major floral volatiles. A ß-glucuronidase fusion construct with a promoter of one of these genes demonstrated that gene expression was restricted to the sepals, stigmas, anther filaments, and receptacles, reaching a peak when the stigma was receptive to cross pollen. The observation that Arabidopsis flowers synthesize and emit volatiles raises intriguing questions about the reproductive behavior of Arabidopsis in the wild and allows detailed investigations of floral volatile biosynthesis and its regulation to be performed with this model plant system.",arabidopsis believed mostly self pollinated although several line genetic morphological evidence indicate insect mediated outcrossing occurs least low frequency wild population here show arabidopsis flower emit monoterpenes sesquiterpenes potential olfactory cue pollinating insect of terpene synthase gene arabidopsis genome found expressed flower exclusively almost exclusively two terpene synthase gene expressed exclusively flower one terpene synthase gene expressed almost exclusively flower characterized found encode protein catalyze formation major floral volatile a glucuronidase fusion construct promoter one gene demonstrated gene expression restricted sepal stigma anther filament receptacle reaching peak stigma receptive cross pollen the observation arabidopsis flower synthesize emit volatile raise intriguing question reproductive behavior arabidopsis wild allows detailed investigation floral volatile biosynthesis regulation performed model plant system,low
7,Biosynthetic Pathway of Insect Juvenile Hormone III in Cell Suspension Cultures of the Sedge Cyperus iria  ,"In most insect species, juvenile hormones regulate critical physiological processes such as metamorphosis and reproduction. In insects, these sesquiterpenoids are synthesized by retrocerebral endocrine organs, the corpora allata, via the classical mevalonate (MVA) pathway. One of these compounds, juvenile hormone III (JH III), has also been identified in the sedge Cyperus iria. In higher plants, biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid backbone may proceed through two distinct pathways: the MVA pathway or the 2C-methyl erythritol 4-phosphate pathway or through a combination of both pathways. Cell suspension cultures of C. iria were used to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of JH III in the plant. Enzyme inhibition and labeling studies conclusively demonstrated that the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid backbone of JH III proceeds via the MVA pathway. Inhibitor and precursor feeding studies also suggest that later steps of JH III biosynthesis inC. iria are similar to the insect pathway and that the final enzymatic reaction in JH III biosynthesis is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase.",in insect specie juvenile hormone regulate critical physiological process metamorphosis reproduction in insect sesquiterpenoids synthesized retrocerebral endocrine organ corpus allata via classical mevalonate mva pathway one compound juvenile hormone iii jh iii also identified sedge cyperus iria in higher plant biosynthesis sesquiterpenoid backbone may proceed two distinct pathway mva pathway c methyl erythritol phosphate pathway combination pathway cell suspension culture c iria used elucidate biosynthetic pathway jh iii plant enzyme inhibition labeling study conclusively demonstrated biosynthesis sesquiterpenoid backbone jh iii proceeds via mva pathway inhibitor precursor feeding study also suggest later step jh iii biosynthesis inc iria similar insect pathway final enzymatic reaction jh iii biosynthesis catalyzed cytochrome p monooxygenase,low
8,Bisphosphonate Inhibitors Reveal a Large Elasticity of Plastidic Isoprenoid Synthesis Pathway in Isoprene-Emitting Hybrid Aspen,"Recently, a feedback inhibition of the chloroplastic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP)/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid synthesis by end products dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IDP) was postulated, but the extent to which DMADP and IDP can build up is not known. We used bisphosphonate inhibitors, alendronate and zoledronate, that inhibit the consumption of DMADP and IDP by prenyltransferases to gain insight into the extent of end product accumulation and possible feedback inhibition in isoprene-emitting hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides). A kinetic method based on dark release of isoprene emission at the expense of substrate pools accumulated in light was used to estimate the in vivo pool sizes of DMADP and upstream metabolites. Feeding with fosmidomycin, an inhibitor of DXP reductoisomerase, alone or in combination with bisphosphonates was used to inhibit carbon input into DXP/MEP pathway or both input and output. We observed a major increase in pathway intermediates, 3- to 4-fold, upstream of DMADP in bisphosphonate-inhibited leaves, but the DMADP pool was enhanced much less, 1.3- to 1.5-fold. In combined fosmidomycin/bisphosphonate treatment, pathway intermediates accumulated, reflecting cytosolic flux of intermediates that can be important under strong metabolic pull in physiological conditions. The data suggested that metabolites accumulated upstream of DMADP consist of phosphorylated intermediates and IDP. Slow conversion of the huge pools of intermediates to DMADP was limited by reductive energy supply. These data indicate that the DXP/MEP pathway is extremely elastic, and the presence of a significant pool of phosphorylated intermediates provides an important valve for fine tuning the pathway flux.",recently feedback inhibition chloroplastic deoxy d xylulose phosphate dxp c methyl d erythritol phosphate mep pathway isoprenoid synthesis end product dimethylallyl diphosphate dmadp isopentenyl diphosphate idp postulated extent dmadp idp build known we used bisphosphonate inhibitor alendronate zoledronate inhibit consumption dmadp idp prenyltransferases gain insight extent end product accumulation possible feedback inhibition isoprene emitting hybrid aspen populus tremula populus tremuloides a kinetic method based dark release isoprene emission expense substrate pool accumulated light used estimate vivo pool size dmadp upstream metabolite feeding fosmidomycin inhibitor dxp reductoisomerase alone combination bisphosphonates used inhibit carbon input dxp mep pathway input output we observed major increase pathway intermediate fold upstream dmadp bisphosphonate inhibited leaf dmadp pool enhanced much le fold in combined fosmidomycin bisphosphonate treatment pathway intermediate accumulated reflecting cytosolic flux intermediate important strong metabolic pull physiological condition the data suggested metabolite accumulated upstream dmadp consist phosphorylated intermediate idp slow conversion huge pool intermediate dmadp limited reductive energy supply these data indicate dxp mep pathway extremely elastic presence significant pool phosphorylated intermediate provides important valve fine tuning pathway flux,low
9,Can forest trees compensate for stress-generated growth losses by induced production of volatile compounds?,"Plants produce a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Under abiotic and biotic stresses, the number and amount of produced compounds can increase. Due to their long life span and large size, trees can produce biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) in much higher amounts than many other plants. It has been suggested that at cellular and tree physiological levels, induced production of VOCs is aimed at improving plant resistance to damage by reactive oxygen species generated by multiple abiotic stresses. In the few reported cases when biosynthesis of plant volatiles is inhibited or enhanced, the observed response to stress can be attributed to plant volatiles. Reported increase, e.g., in photosynthesis has mostly ranged between 5 and 50%. A comprehensive model to explain similar induction of VOCs under multiple biotic stresses is not yet available. As a result of pathogen or herbivore attack on forest trees, the induced production of VOCs is localized to the damage site but systemic induction of emissions has also been detected. These volatiles can affect fungal pathogens and the arrival rate of herbivorous insects on damaged trees, but also act as signalling compounds to maintain the trophic cascades that may improve tree fitness by improved efficiency of herbivore natural enemies. On the forest scale, biotic induction of VOC synthesis and release leads to an amplified flow of BVOCs in atmospheric reactions, which in atmospheres rich in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) results in ozone formation, and in low NOx atmospheres results in oxidation of VOCs, removal in ozone from the troposphere and the resulting formation of biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles. I will summarize recent advances in the understanding of stress-induced VOC emissions from trees, with special focus on Populus spp. Particular importance is given to the ecological and atmospheric feedback systems based on BVOCs and biogenic SOA formation.",plants produce variety volatile organic compound vocs under abiotic biotic stress number amount produced compound increase due long life span large size tree produce biogenic vocs bvocs much higher amount many plant it suggested cellular tree physiological level induced production vocs aimed improving plant resistance damage reactive oxygen specie generated multiple abiotic stress in reported case biosynthesis plant volatile inhibited enhanced observed response stress attributed plant volatile reported increase e g photosynthesis mostly ranged a comprehensive model explain similar induction vocs multiple biotic stress yet available as result pathogen herbivore attack forest tree induced production vocs localized damage site systemic induction emission also detected these volatile affect fungal pathogen arrival rate herbivorous insect damaged tree also act signalling compound maintain trophic cascade may improve tree fitness improved efficiency herbivore natural enemy on forest scale biotic induction voc synthesis release lead amplified flow bvocs atmospheric reaction atmosphere rich oxide nitrogen nox result ozone formation low nox atmosphere result oxidation vocs removal ozone troposphere resulting formation biogenic secondary organic aerosol soa particle i summarize recent advance understanding stress induced voc emission tree special focus populus spp particular importance given ecological atmospheric feedback system based bvocs biogenic soa formation,low
10,"Characterization of a Root-Specific Arabidopsis Terpene Synthase Responsible for the Formation of the Volatile Monoterpene 1,8-Cineole","Arabidopsis is emerging as a model system to study the biochemistry, biological functions, and evolution of plant terpene secondary metabolism. It was previously shown that the Arabidopsis genome contains over 30 genes potentially encoding terpene synthases (TPSs). Here we report the characterization of a monoterpene synthase encoded by two identical, closely linked genes, At3g25820 and At3g25830. Transcripts of these genes were detected almost exclusively in roots. An At3g25820/At3g25830 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein thus produced was shown to catalyze the formation of 10 volatile monoterpenes from geranyl diphosphate, with 1,8-cineole predominating. This protein was therefore designated AtTPS-Cin. The purified recombinant AtTPS-Cin displayed similar biochemical properties to other known monoterpene synthases, except for a relatively low K  m value for geranyl diphosphate of 0.2 µ  M. At3g25820/At3g25830 promoter activity, measured with a ß-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, was primarily found in the epidermis, cortex, and stele of mature primary and lateral roots, but not in the root meristem or the elongation zone. Although the products of AtTPS-Cin were not detected by direct extraction of plant tissue, the recent report of 1,8-cineole as an Arabidopsis root volatile (Steeghs M, Bais HP, de Gouw J, Goldan P, Kuster W, Northway M, Fall R, Vivanco JM [2004] Plant Physiol 135: 47–58) suggests that the enzyme products may be released into the rhizosphere rather than accumulated. Among Arabidopsis TPSs, AtTPS-Cin is most similar to the TPS encoded by At3g25810, a closely linked gene previously shown to be exclusively expressed in flowers. At3g25810 TPS catalyzes the formation of a set of monoterpenes that is very similar to those produced by AtTPS-Cin, but its major products are myrcene and (E)-ß-ocimene, and it does not form 1,8-cineole. These data demonstrate that divergence of organ expression pattern and product specificity are ongoing processes within the Arabidopsis TPS family.",arabidopsis emerging model system study biochemistry biological function evolution plant terpene secondary metabolism it previously shown arabidopsis genome contains gene potentially encoding terpene synthases tpss here report characterization monoterpene synthase encoded two identical closely linked gene at g at g transcripts gene detected almost exclusively root an at g at g cdna expressed escherichia coli protein thus produced shown catalyze formation volatile monoterpenes geranyl diphosphate cineole predominating this protein therefore designated attps cin the purified recombinant attps cin displayed similar biochemical property known monoterpene synthases except relatively low k value geranyl diphosphate m at g at g promoter activity measured glucuronidase gus reporter gene primarily found epidermis cortex stele mature primary lateral root root meristem elongation zone although product attps cin detected direct extraction plant tissue recent report cineole arabidopsis root volatile steeghs m bais hp de gouw j goldan p kuster w northway m fall r vivanco jm plant physiol suggests enzyme product may released rhizosphere rather accumulated among arabidopsis tpss attps cin similar tps encoded at g closely linked gene previously shown exclusively expressed flower at g tps catalyzes formation set monoterpenes similar produced attps cin major product myrcene e ocimene form cineole these data demonstrate divergence organ expression pattern product specificity ongoing process within arabidopsis tps family,low
11,Characterization of Biosynthetic Pathways for the Production of the Volatile Homoterpenes DMNT and TMTT in Zea mays  ,"Plant volatiles not only have multiple defense functions against herbivores, fungi, and bacteria, but also have been implicated in signaling within the plant and toward other organisms. Elucidating the function of individual plant volatiles will require more knowledge of their biosynthesis and regulation in response to external stimuli. By exploiting the variation of herbivore-induced volatiles among 26 maize (Zea mays) inbred lines, we conducted a nested association mapping and genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify a set of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for investigating the pathways of volatile terpene production. The most significant identified QTL affects the emission of (E)-nerolidol, linalool, and the two homoterpenes (E)-3,8-dimethyl-1,4,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT). GWAS associated a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter of the gene encoding the terpene synthase TPS2 with this QTL. Biochemical characterization of TPS2 verified that this plastid-localized enzyme forms linalool, (E)-nerolidol, and (E,E)-geranyllinalool. The subsequent conversion of (E)-nerolidol into DMNT maps to a P450 monooxygenase, CYP92C5, which is capable of converting nerolidol into DMNT by oxidative degradation. A QTL influencing TMTT accumulation corresponds to a similar monooxygenase, CYP92C6, which is specific for the conversion of (E,E)-geranyllinalool to TMTT. The DMNT biosynthetic pathway and both monooxygenases are distinct from those previously characterized for DMNT and TMTT synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting independent evolution of these enzymatic activities.",plant volatile multiple defense function herbivore fungi bacteria also implicated signaling within plant toward organism elucidating function individual plant volatile require knowledge biosynthesis regulation response external stimulus by exploiting variation herbivore induced volatile among maize zea may inbred line conducted nested association mapping genome wide association study gwas identify set quantitative trait locus qtls investigating pathway volatile terpene production the significant identified qtl affect emission e nerolidol linalool two homoterpenes e dimethyl nonatriene dmnt e e trimethyltrideca tetraene tmtt gwas associated single nucleotide polymorphism promoter gene encoding terpene synthase tps qtl biochemical characterization tps verified plastid localized enzyme form linalool e nerolidol e e geranyllinalool the subsequent conversion e nerolidol dmnt map p monooxygenase cyp c capable converting nerolidol dmnt oxidative degradation a qtl influencing tmtt accumulation corresponds similar monooxygenase cyp c specific conversion e e geranyllinalool tmtt the dmnt biosynthetic pathway monooxygenases distinct previously characterized dmnt tmtt synthesis arabidopsis thaliana suggesting independent evolution enzymatic activity,low
12,"Characterization of d-Guaiene Synthases from Cultured Cells of Aquilaria, Responsible for the Formation of the Sesquiterpenes in Agarwood","The resinous portions of Aquilaria plants, called agarwood, have been used as medicines and incenses. Agarwood contains a great variety of sesquiterpenes, and a study using cultured cells of Aquilaria showed the production of sesquiterpenes (a-guaiene, a-humulene, and d-guaiene) to be induced by treatment with methyl jasmonate (MJ). In this study, the accumulation and production of sesquiterpenes were quantified. The amounts accumulated and produced reached a maximum at 12 h, and the most abundant product was a-humulene at 6 h and d-guaiene after 12 h. However, a headspace analysis of the cells revealed that a-humulene is likely to be volatilized; so overall, the most abundant sesquiterpene in the cells was d-guaiene. A cDNA library from RNA isolated from MJ-treated cells was screened using PCR methodologies to isolate five clones with very similar amino acid sequences. These clones were expressed in Escherichia coli, and enzymatic reactions using farnesyl pyrophosphate revealed that three of the clones yielded the same compounds as extracted from MJ-treated cells, the major product being d-guaiene. These genes and their encoded enzymes are the first sesquiterpene synthases yielding guaiane-type sesquiterpenes as their major products to be reported. Expression of a fourth terpene synthase gene in bacteria resulted in the accumulation of the protein in insoluble forms. Site-directed mutagenesis of the inactive clone and three-dimensional homology modeling suggested that the structure of the N-terminal domain was important in facilitating proper folding of the protein to form a catalytically active structure.",the resinous portion aquilaria plant called agarwood used medicine incense agarwood contains great variety sesquiterpenes study using cultured cell aquilaria showed production sesquiterpenes guaiene humulene guaiene induced treatment methyl jasmonate mj in study accumulation production sesquiterpenes quantified the amount accumulated produced reached maximum h abundant product humulene h guaiene h however headspace analysis cell revealed humulene likely volatilized overall abundant sesquiterpene cell guaiene a cdna library rna isolated mj treated cell screened using pcr methodology isolate five clone similar amino acid sequence these clone expressed escherichia coli enzymatic reaction using farnesyl pyrophosphate revealed three clone yielded compound extracted mj treated cell major product guaiene these gene encoded enzyme first sesquiterpene synthases yielding guaiane type sesquiterpenes major product reported expression fourth terpene synthase gene bacteria resulted accumulation protein insoluble form site directed mutagenesis inactive clone three dimensional homology modeling suggested structure n terminal domain important facilitating proper folding protein form catalytically active structure,low
13,Chemical and Molecular Ecology of Herbivore-Induced Plant Volatiles: Proximate Factors and Their Ultimate Functions,"In response to herbivory, plants emit specific blends of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). HIPVs mediate sizable arrays of interactions between plants and arthropods, microorganisms, undamaged neighboring plants or undamaged sites within the plant in various ecosystems. HIPV profiles vary according to the plant and herbivore species, and the developmental stages and conditions of the live plants and herbivores. To understand the regulatory mechanisms underling HIPV biosynthesis, the following issues are reviewed here: (i) herbivore-induced formation of plant volatile terpenoids and green leaf volatiles; (ii) initial activation of plant responses by feeding herbivores; and (iii) the downstream network of the signal transduction. To understand the ecological significance of HIPVs, we also review case studies of insect–plant and inter-/intraplant interactions mediated by HIPVs that have been documented in the field and laboratory in recent years.",in response herbivory plant emit specific blend herbivore induced plant volatile hipvs hipvs mediate sizable array interaction plant arthropod microorganism undamaged neighboring plant undamaged site within plant various ecosystem hipv profile vary according plant herbivore specie developmental stage condition live plant herbivore to understand regulatory mechanism underling hipv biosynthesis following issue reviewed herbivore induced formation plant volatile terpenoids green leaf volatile ii initial activation plant response feeding herbivore iii downstream network signal transduction to understand ecological significance hipvs also review case study insect plant inter intraplant interaction mediated hipvs documented field laboratory recent year,low
14,CitAP2.10 activation of the terpene synthase CsTPS1 is associated with the synthesis of (+)-valencene in ‘Newhall’ orange,"Aroma is a vital characteristic that determines the quality and commercial value of citrus fruits, and characteristic volatiles have been analyzed in different citrus species. In sweet orange, Citrus sinensis, the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene is a key volatile compound in the fruit peel. Valencene synthesis is catalyzed by the terpene synthase CsTPS1, but the transcriptional mechanisms controlling its gene expression are unknown. Here, the AP2/ERF (APETALA2/ethylene response factor) transcription factor, CitAP2.10, is characterized as a regulator of (+)-valencene synthesis. The expression pattern of CitAP2.10 was positively correlated with (+)-valencene content and CsTPS1 expression. Dual-luciferase assays indicated that CitAP2.10 could trans-activate the CsTPS1 promoter. Ethylene enhanced expression of CitAP2.10 and this effect was abolished by the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene. The role and function of CitAP2.10 in (+)-valencene biosynthesis were confirmed using the Arabidopsis homolog (AtWRI1), which also transiently activated the CsTPS1 promoter. Furthermore, transient over-expression of CitAP2.10 triggered (+)-valencene biosynthesis in sweet orange fruit. These results indicate that CitAP2.10 regulates (+)-valencene synthesis via induction of CsTPS1 mRNA accumulation.",aroma vital characteristic determines quality commercial value citrus fruit characteristic volatile analyzed different citrus specie in sweet orange citrus sinensis sesquiterpene valencene key volatile compound fruit peel valencene synthesis catalyzed terpene synthase cstps transcriptional mechanism controlling gene expression unknown here ap erf apetala ethylene response factor transcription factor citap characterized regulator valencene synthesis the expression pattern citap positively correlated valencene content cstps expression dual luciferase assay indicated citap could trans activate cstps promoter ethylene enhanced expression citap effect abolished ethylene antagonist methylcyclopropene the role function citap valencene biosynthesis confirmed using arabidopsis homolog atwri also transiently activated cstps promoter furthermore transient expression citap triggered valencene biosynthesis sweet orange fruit these result indicate citap regulates valencene synthesis via induction cstps mrna accumulation,low
15,Determination of Residues Responsible for Substrate and Product Specificity of Solanum habrochaites Short-Chain cis-Prenyltransferases    ,"Isoprenoids are diverse compounds that have their biosynthetic origin in the initial condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate to form C10 prenyl diphosphates that can be elongated by the addition of subsequent isopentenyl diphosphate units. These reactions are catalyzed by either cis-prenyltransferases (CPTs) or trans-prenyltransferases. The synthesis of volatile terpenes in plants typically proceeds through either geranyl diphosphate (C10) or trans-farnesyl diphosphate (C15), to yield monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, respectively. However, terpene biosynthesis in glandular trichomes of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and related wild relatives also occurs via the cis-substrates neryl diphosphate (NPP) and 2  Z,6  Z-farnesyl diphosphate (Z,Z-FPP). NPP and Z,Z-FPP are synthesized by neryl diphosphate synthase1 (NDPS1) and Z,Z-farnesyl diphosphate synthase (zFPS), which are encoded by the orthologous CPT1 locus in tomato and Solanum habrochaites, respectively. In this study, comparative sequence analysis of NDPS1 and zFPS enzymes from S. habrochaites accessions that synthesize either monoterpenes or sesquiterpenes was performed to identify amino acid residues that correlate with the ability to synthesize NPP or Z,Z-FPP. Subsequent structural modeling, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, highlighted the importance of four amino acids located within conserved domain II of CPT enzymes that form part of the second a-helix, for determining substrate and product specificity of these enzymes. In particular, the relative positioning of aromatic amino acid residues at positions 100 and 107 determines the ability of these enzymes to synthesize NPP or Z,Z-FPP.

16,Distinct metabolic pathways drive monoterpenoid biosynthesis in a natural population of Pelargonium graveolens,"Pelargonium graveolens is a wild predecessor to rose-scented geranium hybrids prized for their essential oils used as fragrances and flavorings. However, little is known about their biosynthesis. Here we present metabolic evidence that at least two distinct monoterpene biosynthetic pathways contribute to their volatile profiles, namely, cyclic p-menthanes such as (-)-isomenthone and acyclic monoterpene alcohols such as geraniol and (-)-citronellol and their derivatives (referred to here as citronelloid monoterpenes). We established their common origin via the 2C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway but found no indication these pathways share common intermediates beyond geranyl diphosphate. Untargeted volatile profiling of 22 seed-grown P. graveolens lines demonstrated distinct chemotypes that preferentially accumulate (-)-isomenthone, geraniol, or (-)-citronellol along with approximately 85 minor volatile products. Whole plant 13CO2 isotopic labeling performed under physiological conditions permitted us to measure the in vivo rates of monoterpenoid accumulation in these lines and quantify differences in metabolic modes between chemotypes. We further determined that p-menthane monoterpenoids in Pelargonium are likely synthesized from (+)-limonene via (+)-piperitone rather than (+)-pulegone. Exploitation of this natural population enabled a detailed dissection of the relative rates of competing p-menthane and citronelloid pathways in this species, providing real time rates of monoterpene accumulation in glandular trichomes.",pelargonium graveolens wild predecessor rose scented geranium hybrid prized essential oil used fragrance flavoring however little known biosynthesis here present metabolic evidence least two distinct monoterpene biosynthetic pathway contribute volatile profile namely cyclic p menthanes isomenthone acyclic monoterpene alcohol geraniol citronellol derivative referred citronelloid monoterpenes we established common origin via c methyl erythritol phosphate pathway found indication pathway share common intermediate beyond geranyl diphosphate untargeted volatile profiling seed grown p graveolens line demonstrated distinct chemotypes preferentially accumulate isomenthone geraniol citronellol along approximately minor volatile product whole plant co isotopic labeling performed physiological condition permitted u measure vivo rate monoterpenoid accumulation line quantify difference metabolic mode chemotypes we determined p menthane monoterpenoids pelargonium likely synthesized limonene via piperitone rather pulegone exploitation natural population enabled detailed dissection relative rate competing p menthane citronelloid pathway specie providing real time rate monoterpene accumulation glandular trichomes,high
17,Ectopic Terpene Synthase Expression Enhances Sesquiterpene Emission in Nicotiana attenuata without Altering Defense or Development of Transgenic Plants or Neighbors  ,"Sesquiterpenoids, with approximately 5,000 structures, are the most diverse class of plant volatiles with manifold hypothesized functions in defense, stress tolerance, and signaling between and within plants. These hypotheses have often been tested by transforming plants with sesquiterpene synthases expressed behind the constitutively active 35S promoter, which may have physiological costs measured as inhibited growth and reduced reproduction or may require augmentation of substrate pools to achieve enhanced emission, complicating the interpretation of data from affected transgenic lines. Here, we expressed maize (Zea mays) terpene synthase10 (ZmTPS10), which produces (E)-a-bergamotene and (E)-ß-farnesene, or a point mutant ZmTPS10M, which produces primarily (E)-ß-farnesene, under control of the 35S promoter in the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata. Transgenic N. attenuata plants had specifically enhanced emission of target sesquiterpene(s) with no changes detected in their emission of any other volatiles. Treatment with herbivore or jasmonate elicitors induces emission of (E)-a-bergamotene in wild-type plants and also tended to increase emission of (E)-a-bergamotene and (E)-ß-farnesene in transgenics. However, transgenics did not differ from the wild type in defense signaling or chemistry and did not alter defense chemistry in neighboring wild-type plants. These data are inconsistent with within-plant and between-plant signaling functions of (E)-ß-farnesene and (E)-a-bergamotene in N. attenuata. Ectopic sesquiterpene emission was apparently not costly for transgenics, which were similar to wild-type plants in their growth and reproduction, even when forced to compete for common resources. These transgenics would be well suited for field experiments to investigate indirect ecological effects of sesquiterpenes for a wild plant in its native habitat.",sesquiterpenoids approximately structure diverse class plant volatile manifold hypothesized function defense stress tolerance signaling within plant these hypothesis often tested transforming plant sesquiterpene synthases expressed behind constitutively active s promoter may physiological cost measured inhibited growth reduced reproduction may require augmentation substrate pool achieve enhanced emission complicating interpretation data affected transgenic line here expressed maize zea may terpene synthase zmtps produce e bergamotene e farnesene point mutant zmtps m produce primarily e farnesene control s promoter ecological model plant nicotiana attenuata transgenic n attenuata plant specifically enhanced emission target sesquiterpene change detected emission volatile treatment herbivore jasmonate elicitors induces emission e bergamotene wild type plant also tended increase emission e bergamotene e farnesene transgenics however transgenics differ wild type defense signaling chemistry alter defense chemistry neighboring wild type plant these data inconsistent within plant plant signaling function e farnesene e bergamotene n attenuata ectopic sesquiterpene emission apparently costly transgenics similar wild type plant growth reproduction even forced compete common resource these transgenics would well suited field experiment investigate indirect ecological effect sesquiterpenes wild plant native habitat,low
18,Elevation of night-time temperature increases terpenoid emissions from Betula pendula and Populus tremula,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are expected to have an important role in plant adaptation to high temperatures. The impacts of increasing night-time temperature on daytime terpenoid emissions and related gene expression in silver birch (Betula pendula) and European aspen (Populus tremula) clones were studied. The plants were grown under five different night-time temperatures (6, 10, 14, 18, and 22?°C) while daytime temperature was kept at a constant 22?°C. VOC emissions were collected during the daytime and analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In birch, emissions per leaf area of the C11 homoterpene 4,8-dimethy1-nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) and several sesquiterpenes were consistently increased with increasing night-time temperature. Total sesquiterpene (SQT) emissions showed an increase at higher temperatures. In aspen, emissions of DMNT and ß-ocimene increased from 6?°C to 14?°C, while several other monoterpenes and the SQTs (Z,E)-a-farnesene and (E,E)-a-farnesene increased up to 18?°C. Total monoterpene and sesquiterpene emission peaked at 18?°C, whereas isoprene emissions decreased at 22?°C. Leaf area increased across the temperature range of 6–22?°C by 32% in birch and by 59% in aspen. Specific leaf area (SLA) was also increased in both species. The genetic regulation of VOC emissions seems to be very complex, as indicated by several inverse relationships between emission profiles and expression of several regulatory genes (DXR, DXS, and IPP).

19,ERG9 and COQ1 disruption reveals isoprenoids biosynthesis is closely related to mitochondrial function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Understanding in vivo regulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis is important for identifying strategies to improve carbon fluxes to desirable endproducts. To study the relevance of gene functions, substrate availability, metabolic flux, and the energetics of resource utilization for isoprenoids biosynthesis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was co-engineered with endogenous deregulated erg9 and/or coq1 and exogenous plant genes that will lead to sesqui- and diterpene production. The flow of substrates through the MVA pathway statistically showed isoprenoids precursor levels were tightly regulated by erg9 and coq1 genes in S. cerevisiae. Physiological analysis by fluorescent probes and labeling techniques revealed elimination of the competing and/or degrading pathways by gene knockout can increase cellular stresses and change the energy metabolism. To further evaluate the role of erg9 and coq1 in the regulation of isoprenoids synthesis, heterologous terpene synthases from plants were introduced into S. cerevisiae, including the wild-type and mutant strains along with feeding of various metal cofactors under anoxic/oxic conditions. The product distribution in the strains indicated that the energy barrier could be the reason that different metal ion-assisted electrophilic attacks initiated carbocation formation, carbocation stabilization, and rearrangement, incorporating exquisite regio- and stereospecificity, to generate structurally diverse products. The yeast altered in the profile of terpenoids and their precursor pools aided the mechanisms of terpenoid biosynthesis and its regulation, highlighting the need for mitochondrial function when engineering metabolic flux using assumptions based on a comprehensive network of the mitochondrial system.",understanding vivo regulation isoprenoid biosynthesis important identifying strategy improve carbon flux desirable endproducts to study relevance gene function substrate availability metabolic flux energetics resource utilization isoprenoids biosynthesis saccharomyces cerevisiae co engineered endogenous deregulated erg coq exogenous plant gene lead sesqui diterpene production the flow substrate mva pathway statistically showed isoprenoids precursor level tightly regulated erg coq gene s cerevisiae physiological analysis fluorescent probe labeling technique revealed elimination competing degrading pathway gene knockout increase cellular stress change energy metabolism to evaluate role erg coq regulation isoprenoids synthesis heterologous terpene synthases plant introduced s cerevisiae including wild type mutant strain along feeding various metal cofactor anoxic oxic condition the product distribution strain indicated energy barrier could reason different metal ion assisted electrophilic attack initiated carbocation formation carbocation stabilization rearrangement incorporating exquisite regio stereospecificity generate structurally diverse product the yeast altered profile terpenoids precursor pool aided mechanism terpenoid biosynthesis regulation highlighting need mitochondrial function engineering metabolic flux using assumption based comprehensive network mitochondrial system,high
20,Formation of the Unusual Semivolatile Diterpene Rhizathalene by the Arabidopsis Class I Terpene Synthase TPS08 in the Root Stele Is Involved in Defense against Belowground Herbivory,"Secondary metabolites are major constituents of plant defense against herbivore attack. Relatively little is known about the cell type–specific formation and antiherbivore activities of secondary compounds in roots despite the substantial impact of root herbivory on plant performance and fitness. Here, we describe the constitutive formation of semivolatile diterpenes called rhizathalenes by the class I terpene synthase (TPS) 08 in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. The primary enzymatic product of TPS08, rhizathalene A, which is produced from the substrate all-trans geranylgeranyl diphosphate, represents a so far unidentified class of tricyclic diterpene carbon skeletons with an unusual tricyclic spiro-hydrindane structure. Protein targeting and administration of stable isotope precursors indicate that rhizathalenes are biosynthesized in root leucoplasts. TPS08 expression is largely localized to the root stele, suggesting a centric and gradual release of its diterpene products into the peripheral root cell layers. We demonstrate that roots of Arabidopsis tps08 mutant plants, grown aeroponically and in potting substrate, are more susceptible to herbivory by the opportunistic root herbivore fungus gnat (Bradysia spp) and suffer substantial removal of peripheral tissue at larval feeding sites. Our work provides evidence for the in vivo role of semivolatile diterpene metabolites as local antifeedants in belowground direct defense against root-feeding insects.",secondary metabolite major constituent plant defense herbivore attack relatively little known cell type specific formation antiherbivore activity secondary compound root despite substantial impact root herbivory plant performance fitness here describe constitutive formation semivolatile diterpenes called rhizathalenes class i terpene synthase tps root arabidopsis thaliana the primary enzymatic product tps rhizathalene a produced substrate trans geranylgeranyl diphosphate represents far unidentified class tricyclic diterpene carbon skeleton unusual tricyclic spiro hydrindane structure protein targeting administration stable isotope precursor indicate rhizathalenes biosynthesized root leucoplasts tps expression largely localized root stele suggesting centric gradual release diterpene product peripheral root cell layer we demonstrate root arabidopsis tps mutant plant grown aeroponically potting substrate susceptible herbivory opportunistic root herbivore fungus gnat bradysia spp suffer substantial removal peripheral tissue larval feeding site our work provides evidence vivo role semivolatile diterpene metabolite local antifeedants belowground direct defense root feeding insect,low
21,Functional Analysis of the Final Steps of the 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) Pathway to Isoprenoids in Plants Using Virus-Induced Gene Silencing,"Isoprenoid biosynthesis in plant plastids occurs via the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) pathway. We used tobacco rattle virus (TRV) to posttranscriptionally silence the expression of the last two enzymes of this pathway, the IspG-encoded (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate synthase (HDS) and the IspH-encoded isopentenyl/dimethylallyl diphosphate synthase (IDDS), as well as isopentenyl/dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI), the enzyme that interconverts IPP and DMAPP. TRV-IspG and TRV-IspH infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants had albino leaves that contained less than 4% of the chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments of control leaves. We applied [13C]DXP and [14C]DXP to silenced leaves and found that 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate accumulated in plants blocked at HDS while DXP, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl phosphate and (E)-2-methylbut-2-ene-1,4-diol accumulated in IDDS-blocked plants. Albino leaves from IspG- and IspH-silenced plants displayed a disorganized palisade mesophyll, reduced cuticle, fewer plastids, and disrupted thylakoid membranes. These findings demonstrate the participation of HDS and IDDS in the DXP pathway in plants, and support the view that plastid isoprenoid biosynthesis is metabolically and physically segregated from the mevalonate pathway. IDI-silenced plants had mottled white-pale green leaves with disrupted tissue and plastid structure, and showed an 80% reduction in pigments compared to controls. IPP pyrophosphatase activity was higher in chloroplasts isolated from IDI-silenced plants than in control plant chloroplasts. We suggest that a low level of isoprenoid biosynthesis via the DXP pathway can occur without IDI but that this enzyme is required for full function of the DXP pathway.",isoprenoid biosynthesis plant plastid occurs via deoxy d xylulose phosphate dxp pathway we used tobacco rattle virus trv posttranscriptionally silence expression last two enzyme pathway ispg encoded e hydroxy methylbut enyl diphosphate synthase hds isph encoded isopentenyl dimethylallyl diphosphate synthase idds well isopentenyl dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase idi enzyme interconverts ipp dmapp trv ispg trv isph infected nicotiana benthamiana plant albino leaf contained le chlorophyll carotenoid pigment control leaf we applied c dxp c dxp silenced leaf found c methyl d erythritol cyclodiphosphate accumulated plant blocked hds dxp e hydroxy methylbut enyl phosphate e methylbut ene diol accumulated idds blocked plant albino leaf ispg isph silenced plant displayed disorganized palisade mesophyll reduced cuticle fewer plastid disrupted thylakoid membrane these finding demonstrate participation hds idds dxp pathway plant support view plastid isoprenoid biosynthesis metabolically physically segregated mevalonate pathway idi silenced plant mottled white pale green leaf disrupted tissue plastid structure showed reduction pigment compared control ipp pyrophosphatase activity higher chloroplast isolated idi silenced plant control plant chloroplast we suggest low level isoprenoid biosynthesis via dxp pathway occur without idi enzyme required full function dxp pathway,low
22,Functional Characterization of Terpene Synthases Accounting for the Volatilized-Terpene Heterogeneity in Lathyrus odoratus Cultivar Flowers,"Lathyrus odoratus (sweet pea) is an ornamental plant with exceptional floral scent, previously used as an experimental organism in the early development of Mendelian genetics. However, its terpene synthases (TPSs), which act as metabolic gatekeepers in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids, remain to be characterized. Auto-Headspace Solid-phase Microextraction/Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of floral volatile terpene constituents from seven sweet pea cultivars identified a-bergamotene, linalool, (-)-a-cubebene, geraniol, ß-caryophyllene and ß-sesquiphellandrene as the dominant compounds. RNA sequencing was performed to profile the transcriptome of L. odoratus flowers. Bioinformatic analysis identified eight TPS genes (acronymed as LoTPS) that were successfully cloned, heterologously expressed and functionally analyzed. LoTPS4 and LoTPS7, belonging to the TPS-b clade, biochemically catalyzed the formation of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. LoTPS3 and LoTPS8, placed in the TPS-a clade, also generated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, while LoTPS12 belonging to the TPS-g clade showed linalool/nerolidol synthase activity. Notably, biochemical assays of the recombinant LoTPS proteins revealed their catalytic promiscuity, and the enzymatic products were basically consistent with major volatile compounds released from sweet pea flowers. The data from our study lay the foundation for the chemical ecology, molecular genetics and biotechnological improvement of sweet pea and other legumes (Fabaceae).",lathyrus odoratus sweet pea ornamental plant exceptional floral scent previously used experimental organism early development mendelian genetics however terpene synthases tpss act metabolic gatekeeper biosynthesis volatile terpenoids remain characterized auto headspace solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis floral volatile terpene constituent seven sweet pea cultivar identified bergamotene linalool cubebene geraniol caryophyllene sesquiphellandrene dominant compound rna sequencing performed profile transcriptome l odoratus flower bioinformatic analysis identified eight tps gene acronymed lotps successfully cloned heterologously expressed functionally analyzed lotps lotps belonging tps b clade biochemically catalyzed formation monoterpenes sesquiterpenes lotps lotps placed tps clade also generated monoterpenes sesquiterpenes lotps belonging tps g clade showed linalool nerolidol synthase activity notably biochemical assay recombinant lotps protein revealed catalytic promiscuity enzymatic product basically consistent major volatile compound released sweet pea flower the data study lay foundation chemical ecology molecular genetics biotechnological improvement sweet pea legume fabaceae,high
23,Functional Genomics Reveals That a Compact Terpene Synthase Gene Family Can Account for Terpene Volatile Production in Apple  ,"Terpenes are specialized plant metabolites that act as attractants to pollinators and as defensive compounds against pathogens and herbivores, but they also play an important role in determining the quality of horticultural food products. We show that the genome of cultivated apple (Malus domestica) contains 55 putative terpene synthase (TPS) genes, of which only 10 are predicted to be functional. This low number of predicted functional TPS genes compared with other plant species was supported by the identification of only eight potentially functional TPS enzymes in apple ‘Royal Gala’ expressed sequence tag databases, including the previously characterized apple (E,E)-a-farnesene synthase. In planta functional characterization of these TPS enzymes showed that they could account for the majority of terpene volatiles produced in cv Royal Gala, including the sesquiterpenes germacrene-D and (E)-ß-caryophyllene, the monoterpenes linalool and a-pinene, and the homoterpene (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. Relative expression analysis of the TPS genes indicated that floral and vegetative tissues were the primary sites of terpene production in cv Royal Gala. However, production of cv Royal Gala floral-specific terpenes and TPS genes was observed in the fruit of some heritage apple cultivars. Our results suggest that the apple TPS gene family has been shaped by a combination of ancestral and more recent genome-wide duplication events. The relatively small number of functional enzymes suggests that the remaining terpenes produced in floral and vegetative and fruit tissues are maintained under a positive selective pressure, while the small number of terpenes found in the fruit of modern cultivars may be related to commercial breeding strategies.",terpenes specialized plant metabolite act attractants pollinator defensive compound pathogen herbivore also play important role determining quality horticultural food product we show genome cultivated apple malus domestica contains putative terpene synthase tps gene predicted functional this low number predicted functional tps gene compared plant specie supported identification eight potentially functional tps enzyme apple royal gala expressed sequence tag database including previously characterized apple e e farnesene synthase in planta functional characterization tps enzyme showed could account majority terpene volatile produced cv royal gala including sesquiterpenes germacrene d e caryophyllene monoterpenes linalool pinene homoterpene e dimethyl nonatriene relative expression analysis tps gene indicated floral vegetative tissue primary site terpene production cv royal gala however production cv royal gala floral specific terpene tps gene observed fruit heritage apple cultivar our result suggest apple tps gene family shaped combination ancestral recent genome wide duplication event the relatively small number functional enzyme suggests remaining terpene produced floral vegetative fruit tissue maintained positive selective pressure small number terpene found fruit modern cultivar may related commercial breeding strategy,low

The fungus lives in association with a consortium of ectosymbiotic bacteria. The WT strain, when cured of the bacterial symbionts [the cured (CU) form], is pathogenic, causing wilt symptoms similar to those of pathogenic F. oxysporum f. sp. lactucae. Both WT and CU MSA 35 strains produce microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs), but with a different spectrum. In vitro dual culture assays were used to assess the effects of the MVOCs produced by WT and CU strains of F. oxysporum MSA 35 on the growth and expansin gene expression of lettuce seedlings. An increase in the root length (95.6%), shoot length (75.0%) and fresh weight (85.8%) was observed only after WT strain MVOCs exposure. Leaf chlorophyll content was significantly enhanced (68%) in WT strain MVOC-treated seedlings as compared with CU strain volatiles and nontreated controls. ß-Caryophyllene was found to be one of the volatiles released by WT MSA 35 responsible for the plant growth promotion effect.

25,Microalgae in the postgenomic era: a blooming reservoir for new natural products,"Bacteria, fungi, algae and higher plants are the most prolific producers of natural products (secondary metabolites). Compared to macroalgae, considerably fewer natural products have been isolated from microalgae, which offer the possibility of obtaining sufficient and well-defined biological material from laboratory cultures. Interest in microalgae is reinforced by large-scale data sets from genome sequencing projects and the development of genetic tools such as transformation protocols. This review highlights what is currently known about the biosynthesis and biological role of natural products in microalgae, with examples from isoprenoids, complex polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, polyunsaturated fatty acids and oxylipins, alkaloids, and aromatic secondary metabolites. In addition, we introduce a bioinformatic analysis of available genome sequences from totally 16 microalgae, belonging to the green and red algae, heterokonts and haptophytes.

26,Gain and Loss of Fruit Flavor Compounds Produced by Wild and Cultivated Strawberry Species,"The blends of flavor compounds produced by fruits serve as biological perfumes used to attract living creatures, including humans. They include hundreds of metabolites and vary in their characteristic fruit flavor composition. The molecular mechanisms by which fruit flavor and aroma compounds are gained and lost during evolution and domestication are largely unknown. Here, we report on processes that may have been responsible for the evolution of diversity in strawberry (Fragaria spp) fruit flavor components. Whereas the terpenoid profile of cultivated strawberry species is dominated by the monoterpene linalool and the sesquiterpene nerolidol, fruit of wild strawberry species emit mainly olefinic monoterpenes and myrtenyl acetate, which are not found in the cultivated species. We used cDNA microarray analysis to identify the F. ananassa Nerolidol Synthase1 (FaNES1) gene in cultivated strawberry and showed that the recombinant FaNES1 enzyme produced in Escherichia coli cells is capable of generating both linalool and nerolidol when supplied with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), respectively. Characterization of additional genes that are very similar to FaNES1 from both the wild and cultivated strawberry species (FaNES2 and F. vesca NES1) showed that only FaNES1 is exclusively present and highly expressed in the fruit of cultivated (octaploid) varieties. It encodes a protein truncated at its N terminus. Green fluorescent protein localization experiments suggest that a change in subcellular localization led to the FaNES1 enzyme encountering both GPP and FPP, allowing it to produce linalool and nerolidol. Conversely, an insertional mutation affected the expression of a terpene synthase gene that differs from that in the cultivated species (termed F. ananassa Pinene Synthase). It encodes an enzyme capable of catalyzing the biosynthesis of the typical wild species monoterpenes, such as a-pinene and ß-myrcene, and caused the loss of these compounds in the cultivated strawberries. The loss of a-pinene also further influenced the fruit flavor profile because it was no longer available as a substrate for the production of the downstream compounds myrtenol and myrtenyl acetate. This phenomenon was demonstrated by cloning and characterizing a cytochrome P450 gene (Pinene Hydroxylase) that encodes the enzyme catalyzing the C10 hydroxylation of a-pinene to myrtenol. The findings shed light on the molecular evolutionary mechanisms resulting in different flavor profiles that are eventually selected for in domesticated species.",the blend flavor compound produced fruit serve biological perfume used attract living creature including human they include hundred metabolite vary characteristic fruit flavor composition the molecular mechanism fruit flavor aroma compound gained lost evolution domestication largely unknown here report process may responsible evolution diversity strawberry fragaria spp fruit flavor component whereas terpenoid profile cultivated strawberry specie dominated monoterpene linalool sesquiterpene nerolidol fruit wild strawberry specie emit mainly olefinic monoterpenes myrtenyl acetate found cultivated specie we used cdna microarray analysis identify f ananassa nerolidol synthase fanes gene cultivated strawberry showed recombinant fanes enzyme produced escherichia coli cell capable generating linalool nerolidol supplied geranyl diphosphate gpp farnesyl diphosphate fpp respectively characterization additional gene similar fanes wild cultivated strawberry specie fanes f vesca nes showed fanes exclusively present highly expressed fruit cultivated octaploid variety it encodes protein truncated n terminus green fluorescent protein localization experiment suggest change subcellular localization led fanes enzyme encountering gpp fpp allowing produce linalool nerolidol conversely insertional mutation affected expression terpene synthase gene differs cultivated specie termed f ananassa pinene synthase it encodes enzyme capable catalyzing biosynthesis typical wild specie monoterpenes pinene myrcene caused loss compound cultivated strawberry the loss pinene also influenced fruit flavor profile longer available substrate production downstream compound myrtenol myrtenyl acetate this phenomenon demonstrated cloning characterizing cytochrome p gene pinene hydroxylase encodes enzyme catalyzing c hydroxylation pinene myrtenol the finding shed light molecular evolutionary mechanism resulting different flavor profile eventually selected domesticated specie,high
27,Gene Networks Underlying Cannabinoid and Terpenoid Accumulation in Cannabis,"Glandular trichomes are specialized anatomical structures that accumulate secretions with important biological roles in plant-environment interactions. These secretions also have commercial uses in the flavor, fragrance, and pharmaceutical industries. The capitate-stalked glandular trichomes of Cannabis sativa (cannabis), situated on the surfaces of the bracts of the female flowers, are the primary site for the biosynthesis and storage of resins rich in cannabinoids and terpenoids. In this study, we profiled nine commercial cannabis strains with purportedly different attributes, such as taste, color, smell, and genetic origin. Glandular trichomes were isolated from each of these strains, and cell type-specific transcriptome data sets were acquired. Cannabinoids and terpenoids were quantified in flower buds. Statistical analyses indicated that these data sets enable the high-resolution differentiation of strains by providing complementary information. Integrative analyses revealed a coexpression network of genes involved in the biosynthesis of both cannabinoids and terpenoids from imported precursors. Terpene synthase genes involved in the biosynthesis of the major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes routinely assayed by cannabis testing laboratories were identified and functionally evaluated. In addition to cloning variants of previously characterized genes, specifically CsTPS14CT [(-)-limonene synthase] and CsTPS15CT (ß-myrcene synthase), we functionally evaluated genes that encode enzymes with activities not previously described in cannabis, namely CsTPS18VF and CsTPS19BL (nerolidol/linalool synthases), CsTPS16CC (germacrene B synthase), and CsTPS20CT (hedycaryol synthase).

28,"Identification, functional characterization, and regulation of the enzyme responsible for floral (E)-nerolidol biosynthesis in kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis)","Flowers of the kiwifruit species Actinidia chinensis produce a mixture of sesquiterpenes derived from farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and monoterpenes derived from geranyl diphosphate (GDP). The tertiary sesquiterpene alcohol (E)-nerolidol was the major emitted volatile detected by headspace analysis. Contrastingly, in solvent extracts of the flowers, unusually high amounts of (E,E)-farnesol were observed, as well as lesser amounts of (E)-nerolidol, various farnesol and farnesal isomers, and linalool. Using a genomics-based approach, a single gene (AcNES1) was identified in an A. chinensis expressed sequence tag library that had significant homology to known floral terpene synthase enzymes. In vitro characterization of recombinant AcNES1 revealed it was an enzyme that could catalyse the conversion of FDP and GDP to the respective (E)-nerolidol and linalool terpene alcohols. Enantiomeric analysis of both AcNES1 products in vitro and floral terpenes in planta showed that (S)-(E)-nerolidol was the predominant enantiomer. Real-time PCR analysis indicated peak expression of AcNES1 correlated with peak (E)-nerolidol, but not linalool accumulation in flowers. This result, together with subcellular protein localization to the cytoplasm, indicated that AcNES1 was acting as a (S)-(E)-nerolidol synthase in A. chinensis flowers. The synthesis of high (E,E)-farnesol levels appears to compete for the available pool of FDP utilized by AcNES1 for sesquiterpene biosynthesis and hence strongly influences the accumulation and emission of (E)-nerolidol in A. chinensis flowers.",flowers kiwifruit specie actinidia chinensis produce mixture sesquiterpenes derived farnesyl diphosphate fdp monoterpenes derived geranyl diphosphate gdp the tertiary sesquiterpene alcohol e nerolidol major emitted volatile detected headspace analysis contrastingly solvent extract flower unusually high amount e e farnesol observed well lesser amount e nerolidol various farnesol farnesal isomer linalool using genomics based approach single gene acnes identified a chinensis expressed sequence tag library significant homology known floral terpene synthase enzyme in vitro characterization recombinant acnes revealed enzyme could catalyse conversion fdp gdp respective e nerolidol linalool terpene alcohol enantiomeric analysis acnes product vitro floral terpene planta showed s e nerolidol predominant enantiomer real time pcr analysis indicated peak expression acnes correlated peak e nerolidol linalool accumulation flower this result together subcellular protein localization cytoplasm indicated acnes acting s e nerolidol synthase a chinensis flower the synthesis high e e farnesol level appears compete available pool fdp utilized acnes sesquiterpene biosynthesis hence strongly influence accumulation emission e nerolidol a chinensis flower,low
29,Induction of Volatile Terpene Biosynthesis and Diurnal Emission by Methyl Jasmonate in Foliage of Norway Spruce,"Terpenoids are characteristic constitutive and inducible defense chemicals of conifers. The biochemical regulation of terpene formation, accumulation, and release from conifer needles was studied in Norway spruce [Picea abies L. (Karst)] saplings using methyl jasmonate (MeJA) to induce defensive responses without inflicting physical damage to terpene storage structures. MeJA treatment caused a 2-fold increase in monoterpene and sesquiterpene accumulation in needles without changes in terpene composition, much less than the 10- and 40-fold increases in monoterpenes and diterpenes, respectively, observed in wood tissue after MeJA treatment (D. Martin, D. Tholl, J. Gershenzon, J. Bohlmann [2002] Plant Physiol 129: 1003–1018). At the same time, MeJA triggered a 5-fold increase in total terpene emission from foliage, with a shift in composition to a blend dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes (e.g. linalool) and sesquiterpenes [e.g. (E)-ß-farnesene] that also included methyl salicylate. The rate of linalool emission increased more than 100-fold and that of sesquiterpenes increased more than 30-fold. Emission of these compounds followed a pronounced diurnal rhythm with the maximum amount released during the light period. The major MeJA-induced volatile terpenes appear to be synthesized de novo after treatment, rather than being released from stored terpene pools, because they are almost completely absent from needle oleoresin and are the major products of terpene synthase activity measured after MeJA treatment. Based on precedents in other species, the induced emission of terpenes from Norway spruce foliage may have ecological and physiological significance.",terpenoids characteristic constitutive inducible defense chemical conifer the biochemical regulation terpene formation accumulation release conifer needle studied norway spruce picea abies l karst sapling using methyl jasmonate meja induce defensive response without inflicting physical damage terpene storage structure meja treatment caused fold increase monoterpene sesquiterpene accumulation needle without change terpene composition much le fold increase monoterpenes diterpenes respectively observed wood tissue meja treatment d martin d tholl j gershenzon j bohlmann plant physiol at time meja triggered fold increase total terpene emission foliage shift composition blend dominated oxygenated monoterpenes e g linalool sesquiterpenes e g e farnesene also included methyl salicylate the rate linalool emission increased fold sesquiterpenes increased fold emission compound followed pronounced diurnal rhythm maximum amount released light period the major meja induced volatile terpene appear synthesized de novo treatment rather released stored terpene pool almost completely absent needle oleoresin major product terpene synthase activity measured meja treatment based precedent specie induced emission terpene norway spruce foliage may ecological physiological significance,low
30,"Insect-Induced Conifer Defense. White Pine Weevil and Methyl Jasmonate Induce Traumatic Resinosis, de Novo Formed Volatile Emissions, and Accumulation of Terpenoid Synthase and Putative Octadecanoid Pathway Transcripts in Sitka Spruce  ","Stem-boring insects and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) are thought to induce similar complex chemical and anatomical defenses in conifers. To compare insect- and MeJA-induced terpenoid responses, we analyzed traumatic oleoresin mixtures, emissions of terpenoid volatiles, and expression of terpenoid synthase (TPS) genes in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) following attack by white pine weevils (Pissodes strobi) or application of MeJA. Both insects and MeJA caused traumatic resin accumulation in stems, with more accumulation induced by the weevils. Weevil-induced terpenoid emission profiles were also more complex than emissions induced by MeJA. Weevil feeding caused a rapid release of a blend of monoterpene olefins, presumably by passive evaporation of resin compounds from stem feeding sites. These compounds were not found in MeJA-induced emissions. Both weevils and MeJA caused delayed, diurnal emissions of (-)-linalool, indicating induced de novo biosynthesis of this compound. TPS transcripts strongly increased in stems upon insect attack or MeJA treatment. Time courses and intensity of induced TPS transcripts were different for monoterpene synthases, sesquiterpene synthases, and diterpene synthases. Increased levels of weevil- and MeJA-induced TPS transcripts accompanied major changes in terpenoid accumulation in stems. Induced TPS expression profiles in needles were less complex than those in stems and matched induced de novo emissions of (-)-linalool. Overall, weevils and MeJA induced similar, but not identical, terpenoid defense responses in Sitka spruce.

31,Medicago TERPENE SYNTHASE 10 Is Involved in Defense Against an Oomycete Root Pathogen,"In nature, plants interact with numerous beneficial or pathogenic soil-borne microorganisms. Plants have developed various defense strategies to expel pathogenic microbes, some of which function soon after pathogen infection. We used Medicago truncatula and its oomycete pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches to elucidate early responses of the infected root. A. euteiches causes root rot disease in legumes and is a limiting factor in legume production. Transcript profiling of seedlings and adult plant roots inoculated with A. euteiches zoospores for 2 h revealed specific upregulation of a gene encoding a putative sesquiterpene synthase (M. truncatula TERPENE SYNTHASE 10 [MtTPS10]) in both developmental stages. MtTPS10 was specifically expressed in roots upon oomycete infection. Heterologous expression of MtTPS10 in yeast led to production of a blend of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpene alcohols, with NMR identifying a major peak corresponding to himalachol. Moreover, plants carrying a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) retrotransposon Tnt1 insertion in MtTPS10 lacked the emission of sesquiterpenes upon A. euteiches infection, supporting the assumption that the identified gene encodes a multiproduct sesquiterpene synthase. Mttps10 plants and plants with reduced MtTPS10 transcript levels created by expression of an MtTPS10-artificial microRNA in roots were more susceptible to A. euteiches infection than were the corresponding wild-type plants and roots transformed with the empty vector, respectively. Sesquiterpenes produced by expression of MtTPS10 in yeast also inhibited mycelial growth and A. euteiches zoospore germination. These data suggest that sesquiterpene production in roots by MtTPS10 plays a previously unrecognized role in the defense response of M. truncatula against A. euteiches.",in nature plant interact numerous beneficial pathogenic soil borne microorganism plants developed various defense strategy expel pathogenic microbe function soon pathogen infection we used medicago truncatula oomycete pathogen aphanomyces euteiches elucidate early response infected root a euteiches cause root rot disease legume limiting factor legume production transcript profiling seedling adult plant root inoculated a euteiches zoospore h revealed specific upregulation gene encoding putative sesquiterpene synthase m truncatula terpene synthase mttps developmental stage mttps specifically expressed root upon oomycete infection heterologous expression mttps yeast led production blend sesquiterpenes sesquiterpene alcohol nmr identifying major peak corresponding himalachol moreover plant carrying tobacco nicotiana tabacum retrotransposon tnt insertion mttps lacked emission sesquiterpenes upon a euteiches infection supporting assumption identified gene encodes multiproduct sesquiterpene synthase mttps plant plant reduced mttps transcript level created expression mttps artificial microrna root susceptible a euteiches infection corresponding wild type plant root transformed empty vector respectively sesquiterpenes produced expression mttps yeast also inhibited mycelial growth a euteiches zoospore germination these data suggest sesquiterpene production root mttps play previously unrecognized role defense response m truncatula a euteiches,low
32,"Methyl Jasmonate Induces Traumatic Resin Ducts, Terpenoid Resin Biosynthesis, and Terpenoid Accumulation in Developing Xylem of Norway Spruce Stems","Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) produces an oleoresin characterized by a diverse array of terpenoids, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and diterpene resin acids that can protect conifers against potential herbivores and pathogens. Oleoresin accumulates constitutively in resin ducts in the cortex and phloem (bark) of Norway spruce stems. De novo formation of traumatic resin ducts (TDs) is observed in the developing secondary xylem (wood) after insect attack, fungal elicitation, and mechanical wounding. Here, we characterize the methyl jasmonate-induced formation of TDs in Norway spruce by microscopy, chemical analyses of resin composition, and assays of terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes. The response involves tissue-specific differentiation of TDs, terpenoid accumulation, and induction of enzyme activities of both prenyltransferases and terpene synthases in the developing xylem, a tissue that constitutively lacks axial resin ducts in spruce. The induction of a complex defense response in Norway spruce by methyl jasmonate application provides new avenues to evaluate the role of resin defenses for protection of conifers against destructive pests such as white pine weevils (Pissodes strobi), bark beetles (Coleoptera, Scolytidae), and insect-associated tree pathogens.",norway spruce picea abies l karst produce oleoresin characterized diverse array terpenoids monoterpenoids sesquiterpenoids diterpene resin acid protect conifer potential herbivore pathogen oleoresin accumulates constitutively resin duct cortex phloem bark norway spruce stem de novo formation traumatic resin duct tds observed developing secondary xylem wood insect attack fungal elicitation mechanical wounding here characterize methyl jasmonate induced formation tds norway spruce microscopy chemical analysis resin composition assay terpenoid biosynthetic enzyme the response involves tissue specific differentiation tds terpenoid accumulation induction enzyme activity prenyltransferases terpene synthases developing xylem tissue constitutively lack axial resin duct spruce the induction complex defense response norway spruce methyl jasmonate application provides new avenue evaluate role resin defense protection conifer destructive pest white pine weevil pissodes strobi bark beetle coleoptera scolytidae insect associated tree pathogen,medium
33,Biochemistry of Terpenes and Recent Advances in Plant Protection,"
Biodiversity is adversely affected by the growing levels of synthetic chemicals released into the environment due to agricultural activities. This has been the driving force for embracing sustainable agriculture. Plant secondary metabolites offer promising alternatives for protecting plants against microbes, feeding herbivores, and weeds. Terpenes are the largest among PSMs and have been extensively studied for their potential as antimicrobial, insecticidal, and weed control agents. They also attract natural enemies of pests and beneficial insects, such as pollinators and dispersers. However, most of these research findings are shelved and fail to pass beyond the laboratory and greenhouse stages. This review provides an overview of terpenes, types, biosynthesis, and their roles in protecting plants against microbial pathogens, insect pests, and weeds to rekindle the debate on using terpenes for the development of environmentally friendly biopesticides and herbicides.

34,Biological Importance of Cotton By-Products Relative to Chemical Constituents of the Cotton Plant,"
Although cultivated for over 7000 years, mainly for production of cotton fibre, the cotton plant has not been fully explored for potential uses of its other parts. Despite cotton containing many important chemical compounds, limited understanding of its phytochemical composition still exists. In order to add value to waste products of the cotton industry, such as cotton gin trash, this review focuses on phytochemicals associated with different parts of cotton plants and their biological activities. Three major classes of compounds and some primary metabolites have been previously identified in the plant. Among these compounds, most terpenoids and their derivatives (51), fatty acids (four), and phenolics (six), were found in the leaves, bolls, stalks, and stems. Biological activities, such as anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities, are associated with some of these phytochemicals. For example, ß-bisabolol, a sesquiterpenoid enriched in the flowers of cotton plants, may have anti-inflammatory product application. Considering the abundance of biologically active compounds in the cotton plant, there is scope to develop a novel process within the current cotton fibre production system to separate these valuable phytochemicals, developing them into potentially high-value products. This scenario may present the cotton processing industry with an innovative pathway towards a waste-to-profit solution.

35,Chemical Diversity and Defence Metabolism: How Plants Cope with Pathogens and Ozone Pollution,"
Chemical defences represent a main trait of the plant innate immune system. Besides regulating the relationship between plants and their ecosystems, phytochemicals are involved both in resistance against pathogens and in tolerance towards abiotic stresses, such as atmospheric pollution. Plant defence metabolites arise from the main secondary metabolic routes, the phenylpropanoid, the isoprenoid and the alkaloid pathways. In plants, antibiotic compounds can be both preformed (phytoanticipins) and inducible (phytoalexins), the former including saponins, cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates. Chronic exposure to tropospheric ozone (O3) stimulates the carbon fluxes from the primary to the secondary metabolic pathways to a great extent, inducing a shift of the available resources in favour of the synthesis of secondary products. In some cases, the plant defence responses against pathogens and environmental pollutants may overlap, leading to the unspecific synthesis of similar molecules, such as phenylpropanoids. Exposure to ozone can also modify the pattern of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), emitted from plant in response to herbivore feeding, thus altering the tritrophic interaction among plant, phytophagy and their natural enemies. Finally, the synthesis of ethylene and polyamines can be regulated by ozone at level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the biosynthetic precursor of both classes of hormones, which can, therefore, mutually inhibit their own biosynthesis with consequence on plant phenotype.

36,Chemical Diversity of Headspace and Volatile Oil Composition of Two Brown Algae (Taonia atomaria and Padina pavonica) from the Adriatic Sea,"
Two selected brown algae (Taonia atomaria and Padina pavonica from the family Dictyotaceae, order Dictyotales) growing in the same area (island Vis, central Adriatic Sea) were collected at the same time. Their phytochemical composition of the headspace volatile organic compounds (HS-VOCs; first time report) was determined by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME). Hydrodistillation was applied for the isolation of their volatile oils (first report on T. atomaria volatile oil). The isolates were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-FID) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The headspace and oil composition of T. atomaria were quite similar (containing germacrene D, epi-bicyclosesquiphellandrene, ß-cubebene and gleenol as the major compounds). However, P. pavonica headspace and oil composition differed significantly (dimethyl sulfide, octan-1-ol and octanal dominated in the headspace, while the oil contained mainly higher aliphatic alcohols, trans-phytol and pachydictol A). Performed research contributes to the knowledge of the algae chemical biodiversity and reports an array of different compounds (mainly sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and aliphatic compounds); many of them were identified in both algae for the first time. Identified VOCs with distinctive chemical structures could be useful for taxonomic studies of related algae.

37,Citrus Leaf Volatiles as Affected by Developmental Stage and Genetic Type,"
Major volatiles from young and mature leaves of different citrus types were analyzed by headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME)-GC-MS. A total of 123 components were identified form nine citrus cultivars, including nine aldehydes, 19 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 27 oxygenated monoterpenes, 43 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, eight oxygenated sesquiterpenes, two ketones, six esters and nine miscellaneous. Young leaves produced higher amounts of volatiles than mature leaves in most cultivars. The percentage of aldehyde and monoterpene hydrocarbons increased, whilst oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes compounds decreased during leaf development. Linalool was the most abundant compound in young leaves, whereas limonene was the chief component in mature ones. Notably, linalool content decreased, while limonene increased, during leaf development in most cultivars. Leaf volatiles were also affected by genetic types. A most abundant volatile in one or several genotypes can be absent in another one(s), such as limonene in young leaves of lemon vs. Satsuma mandarin and ß-terpinene in mature leaves of three genotypes vs. the other four. Compositional data was subjected to multivariate statistical analysis, and variations in leaf volatiles were identified and clustered into six groups. This research determining the relationship between production of major volatiles from different citrus varieties and leaf stages could be of use for industrial and culinary purposes.

38,Digital Gene Expression Profiling to Explore Differentially Expressed Genes Associated with Terpenoid Biosynthesis during Fruit Development in Litsea cubeba,"
Mountain pepper (Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers.) (Lauraceae) is an important industrial crop as an ingredient in cosmetics, pesticides, food additives and potential biofuels. These properties are attributed to monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. However, there is still no integrated model describing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in terpenoid biosynthesis during the fruit development of L. cubeba. Here, we performed digital gene expression (DGE) using the Illumina NGS platform to evaluated changes in gene expression during fruit development in L. cubeba. DGE generated expression data for approximately 19354 genes. Fruit at 60 days after flowering (DAF) served as the control, and a total of 415, 1255, 449 and 811 up-regulated genes and 505, 1351, 1823 and 1850 down-regulated genes were identified at 75, 90, 105 and 135 DAF, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed 26 genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. Three DEGs had continued increasing or declining trends during the fruit development. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results of five differentially expressed genes were consistent with those obtained from Illumina sequencing. These results provide a comprehensive molecular biology background for research on fruit development, and information that should aid in metabolic engineering to increase the yields of L. cubeba essential oil.

39,"Electronic-Nose Applications for Fruit Identification, Ripeness and Quality Grading","
Fruits produce a wide range of volatile organic compounds that impart their characteristically distinct aromas and contribute to unique flavor characteristics. Fruit aroma and flavor characteristics are of key importance in determining consumer acceptance in commercial fruit markets based on individual preference. Fruit producers, suppliers and retailers traditionally utilize and rely on human testers or panels to evaluate fruit quality and aroma characters for assessing fruit salability in fresh markets. We explore the current and potential utilization of electronic-nose devices (with specialized sensor arrays), instruments that are very effective in discriminating complex mixtures of fruit volatiles, as new effective tools for more efficient fruit aroma analyses to replace conventional expensive methods used in fruit aroma assessments. We review the chemical nature of fruit volatiles during all stages of the agro-fruit production process, describe some of the more important applications that electronic nose (e-nose) technologies have provided for fruit aroma characterizations, and summarize recent research providing e-nose data on the effectiveness of these specialized gas-sensing instruments for fruit identifications, cultivar discriminations, ripeness assessments and fruit grading for assuring fruit quality in commercial markets.

40,Essential Oils as Feed Additives—Future Perspectives,"
The inconsistency of phytogenic feed additives’ (PFA) effects on the livestock industry poses a risk for their use as a replacement for antibiotic growth promoters. The livestock market is being encouraged to use natural growth promotors, but information is limited about the PFA mode of action. The aim of this paper is to present the complexity of compounds present in essential oils (EOs) and factors that influence biological effects of PFA. In this paper, we highlight various controls and optimization parameters that influence the processes for the standardization of these products. The chemical composition of EOs depends on plant genetics, growth conditions, development stage at harvest, and processes of extracting active compounds. Their biological effects are further influenced by the interaction of phytochemicals and their bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. PFA effects on animal health and production are also complex due to various EO antibiotic, antioxidant, anti-quorum sensing, anti-inflammatory, and digestive fluids stimulating activities. Research must focus on reliable methods to identify and control the quality and effects of EOs. In this study, we focused on available microencapsulation techniques of EOs to increase the bioavailability of active compounds, as well as their application in the animal feed additive industry.

41,Evolution of Terpene Synthases in Orchidaceae,"
Terpenoids are the largest class of plant secondary metabolites and are one of the major emitted volatile compounds released to the atmosphere. They have functions of attracting pollinators or defense function, insecticidal properties, and are even used as pharmaceutical agents. Because of the importance of terpenoids, an increasing number of plants are required to investigate the function and evolution of terpene synthases (TPSs) that are the key enzymes in terpenoids biosynthesis. Orchidacea, containing more than 800 genera and 28,000 species, is one of the largest and most diverse families of flowering plants, and is widely distributed. Here, the diversification of the TPSs evolution in Orchidaceae is revealed. A characterization and phylogeny of TPSs from four different species with whole genome sequences is available. Phylogenetic analysis of orchid TPSs indicates these genes are divided into TPS-a, -b, -e/f, and g subfamilies, and their duplicated copies are increased in derived orchid species compared to that in the early divergence orchid, A. shenzhenica. The large increase of both TPS-a and TPS-b copies can probably be attributed to the pro-duction of different volatile compounds for attracting pollinators or generating chemical defenses in derived orchid lineages; while the duplications of TPS-g and TPS-e/f copies occurred in a species-dependent manner.

42,Exploring Plant Sesquiterpene Diversity by Generating Chemical Networks,"
Plants produce a diverse portfolio of sesquiterpenes that are important in their response to herbivores and the interaction with other plants. Their biosynthesis from farnesyl diphosphate depends on the sesquiterpene synthases that admit different cyclizations and rearrangements to yield a blend of sesquiterpenes. Here, we investigate to what extent sesquiterpene biosynthesis metabolic pathways can be reconstructed just from the knowledge of the final product and the reaction mechanisms catalyzed by sesquiterpene synthases. We use the software package MedØlDatschgerl (MØD) to generate chemical networks and to elucidate pathways contained in them. As examples, we successfully consider the reachability of the important plant sesquiterpenes    ß   -caryophyllene,    a   -humulene, and    ß   -farnesene. We also introduce a graph database to integrate the simulation results with experimental biological evidence for the selected predicted sesquiterpenes biosynthesis.

43,Expression of Terpenoid Biosynthetic Genes and Accumulation of Chemical Constituents in Valeriana fauriei,"
Valeriana fauriei (V. fauriei), which emits a characteristic and unpleasant odor, is important in traditional medicine. In this study, the expression of terpenoid biosynthetic genes was investigated in different organs that were also screened for volatile compounds including valerenic acid and its derivatives. Specific expression patterns from different parts of V. fauriei were observed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The highest transcript levels of biosynthetic genes involved in mevalonic acid (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) production were found in the stem. Although the amounts of volatile compounds were varied by organ, most of the volatile terpenoids were accumulated in the root. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 128 volatile compounds, which represented 65.33% to 95.66% of total volatiles. Certain compounds were only found in specific organs. For example, isovalerenic acid and valerenic acid and its derivatives were restricted to the root. Organs with high transcript levels did not necessarily have high levels of the corresponding chemical constituents. According to these results, we hypothesize that translocation may occur between different organs in V. fauriei.

Inhaling forest VOCs like limonene and pinene can result in useful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on the airways, and the pharmacological activity of some terpenes absorbed through inhalation may be also beneficial to promote brain functions by decreasing mental fatigue, inducing relaxation, and improving cognitive performance and mood. The tree composition can markedly influence the concentration of specific VOCs in the forest air, which also exhibits cyclic diurnal variations. Moreover, beneficial psychological and physiological effects of visiting a forest cannot be solely attributed to VOC inhalation but are due to a global and integrated stimulation of the five senses, induced by all specific characteristics of the natural environment, with the visual component probably playing a fundamental role in the overall effect. Globally, these findings can have useful implications for individual wellbeing, public health, and landscape design. Further clinical and environmental studies are advised, since the majority of the existing evidence is derived from laboratory findings.

45,"Functional Characterisation of New Sesquiterpene Synthase from the Malaysian Herbal Plant, Polygonum Minus","
Polygonum minus (syn. Persicaria minor) is a herbal plant that is well known for producing sesquiterpenes, which contribute to its flavour and fragrance. This study describes the cloning and functional characterisation of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2, two sesquiterpene synthase genes that were identified from P. minus transcriptome data mining. The full-length sequences of the PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 genes were expressed in the E. coli pQE-2 expression vector. The sizes of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 were 1098 bp and 1967 bp, respectively, with open reading frames (ORF) of 1047 and 1695 bp and encoding polypeptides of 348 and 564 amino acids, respectively. The proteins consist of three conserved motifs, namely, Asp-rich substrate binding (DDxxD), metal binding residues (NSE/DTE), and cytoplasmic ER retention (RxR), as well as the terpene synthase family N-terminal domain and C-terminal metal-binding domain. From the in vitro enzyme assays, using the farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) substrate, the PmSTPS1 enzyme produced multiple acyclic sesquiterpenes of ß-farnesene, a-farnesene, and farnesol, while the PmSTPS2 enzyme produced an additional nerolidol as a final product. The results confirmed the roles of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 in the biosynthesis pathway of P. minus, to produce aromatic sesquiterpenes.

46,"Fundamental Chemistry of Essential Oils and Volatile Organic Compounds, Methods of Analysis and Authentication","
The current text provides a comprehensive introduction to essential oils, their biosynthesis, naming, analysis, and chemistry. Importantly, this text quickly brings the reader up to a level of competence in the authentication of essential oils and their components. It gives detailed descriptions of enantiomers and other forms of stereoisomers relevant to the study of natural volatiles and essential oils. The text also describes GC-MS work and provides tips on rapid calculation of arithmetic indices, how to interpret suggested names from the NIST mass spectral library, and what additional efforts are required to validate essential oils and defeat sophisticated adulteration tactics. In brief, essential oils are mixtures of volatile organic compounds that were driven out of the raw plant material in distillation, condensed into an oil that is strongly aroma emitting, and collected in a vessel as the top layer (uncommonly bottom layer) of two phase separated liquids: oil and water. Essential oils commonly include components derived from two biosynthetic groups, being terpenes (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and their derivatives) and phenylpropanoids (aromatic ring with a propene tail). The current text provides details of how terpenes and phenylpropanoids are further categorised according to their parent skeleton, then recognised by the character of oxidation, which may be from oxygen, nitrogen, or sulphur, or the presence/absence of a double bond. The essential oil’s science niche is an epicentre of individuals from diverse backgrounds, such as aromatherapy, pharmacy, synthetic and analytical chemistry, or the hobbyist. To make the science more accessible to the curious student or researcher, it was necessary to write this fundamentals-level introduction to the chemistry of essential oils (i.e., organic chemistry in the context of essential oils), which is herein presented as a comprehensive and accessible overview. Lastly, the current review constitutes the only resource that highlights common errors and explains in simplistic detail how to correctly interpret GC-MS data then accurately present the respective chemical information to the wider scientific audience. Therefore, detailed study of the contents herein will equip the individual with prerequisite knowledge necessary to effectively analyse an essential oil and make qualified judgement on its authenticity.

47,Genome-Wide Analysis of Terpene Synthase Gene Family in Mentha longifolia and Catalytic Activity Analysis of a Single Terpene Synthase,"
Terpenoids are a wide variety of natural products and terpene synthase (TPS) plays a key role in the biosynthesis of terpenoids. Mentha plants are rich in essential oils, whose main components are terpenoids, and their biosynthetic pathways have been basically elucidated. However, there is a lack of systematic identification and study of TPS in Mentha plants. In this work, we genome-widely identified and analyzed the TPS gene family in Mentha longifolia, a model plant for functional genomic research in the genus Mentha. A total of 63 TPS genes were identified in the M. longifolia genome sequence assembly, which could be divided into six subfamilies. The TPS-b subfamily had the largest number of genes, which might be related to the abundant monoterpenoids in Mentha plants. The TPS-e subfamily had 18 members and showed a significant species-specific expansion compared with other sequenced Lamiaceae plant species. The 63 TPS genes could be mapped to nine scaffolds of the M. longifolia genome sequence assembly and the distribution of these genes is uneven. Tandem duplicates and fragment duplicates contributed greatly to the increase in the number of TPS genes in M. longifolia. The conserved motifs (RR(X)8W, NSE/DTE, RXR, and DDXXD) were analyzed in M. longifolia TPSs, and significant differentiation was found between different subfamilies. Adaptive evolution analysis showed that M. longifolia TPSs were subjected to purifying selection after the species-specific expansion, and some amino acid residues under positive selection were identified. Furthermore, we also cloned and analyzed the catalytic activity of a single terpene synthase, MlongTPS29, which belongs to the TPS-b subfamily. MlongTPS29 could encode a limonene synthase and catalyze the biosynthesis of limonene, an important precursor of essential oils from the genus Mentha. This study provides useful information for the biosynthesis of terpenoids in the genus Mentha.

48,Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Profile of TPS Gene Family in Dendrobium officinale and the Role of DoTPS10 in Linalool Biosynthesis,"
Terpene synthase (TPS) is a critical enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of terpenes, which possess diverse roles in plant growth and development. Although many terpenes have been reported in orchids, limited information is available regarding the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TPS family in the orchid, Dendrobium officinale. By integrating the D. officinale genome and transcriptional data, 34 TPS genes were found in D. officinale. These were divided into four subfamilies (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, and TPS-e/f). Distinct tempospatial expression profiles of DoTPS genes were observed in 10 organs of D. officinale. Most DoTPS genes were predominantly expressed in flowers, followed by roots and stems. Expression of the majority of DoTPS genes was enhanced following exposure to cold and osmotic stresses. Recombinant DoTPS10 protein, located in chloroplasts, uniquely converted geranyl diphosphate to linalool in vitro. The DoTPS10 gene, which resulted in linalool formation, was highly expressed during all flower developmental stages. Methyl jasmonate significantly up-regulated DoTPS10 expression and linalool accumulation. These results simultaneously provide valuable insight into understanding the roles of the TPS family and lay a basis for further studies on the regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis by DoTPS in D. officinale.

49,Heterologous Production of ß-Caryophyllene and Evaluation of Its Activity against Plant Pathogenic Fungi,"
Terpenoids constitute one of the largest and most diverse groups within the class of secondary metabolites, comprising over 80,000 compounds. They not only exhibit important functions in plant physiology but also have commercial potential in the biotechnological, pharmaceutical, and agricultural sectors due to their promising properties, including various bioactivities against pathogens, inflammations, and cancer. In this work, we therefore aimed to implement the plant sesquiterpenoid pathway leading to ß-caryophyllene in the heterologous host Rhodobacter capsulatus and achieved a maximum production of 139 ± 31 mg L-1 culture. As this sesquiterpene offers various beneficial anti-phytopathogenic activities, we evaluated the bioactivity of ß-caryophyllene and its oxygenated derivative ß-caryophyllene oxide against different phytopathogenic fungi. Here, both compounds significantly inhibited the growth of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Fusarium oxysporum by up to 40%, while growth of Alternaria brassicicola was only slightly affected, and Phoma lingam and Rhizoctonia solani were unaffected. At the same time, the compounds showed a promising low inhibitory profile for a variety of plant growth-promoting bacteria at suitable compound concentrations. Our observations thus give a first indication that ß-caryophyllene and ß-caryophyllene oxide are promising natural agents, which might be applicable for the management of certain plant pathogenic fungi in agricultural crop production.

50,Identification and Characterization of trans-Isopentenyl Diphosphate Synthases Involved in Herbivory-Induced Volatile Terpene Formation in Populus trichocarpa,"
In response to insect herbivory, poplar releases a blend of volatiles that plays important roles in plant defense. Although the volatile bouquet is highly complex and comprises several classes of compounds, it is dominated by mono- and sesquiterpenes. The most common precursors for mono- and sesquiterpenes, geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), respectively, are in general produced by homodimeric or heterodimeric trans-isopentenyl diphosphate synthases (trans-IDSs) that belong to the family of prenyltransferases. To understand the molecular basis of herbivory-induced terpene formation in poplar, we investigated the trans-IDS gene family in the western balsam poplar Populus trichocarpa. Sequence comparisons suggested that this species possesses a single FPP synthase gene (PtFPPS1) and four genes encoding two large subunits (PtGPPS1.LSU and PtGPPS2.LSU) and two small subunits (PtGPPS.SSU1 and PtGPPS.SSU2) of GPP synthases. Transcript accumulation of PtGPPS1.LSU and PtGPPS.SSU1 was significantly upregulated upon leaf herbivory, while the expression of PtFPPS1, PtGPPS2.LSU, and PtGPPS.SSU2 was not influenced by the herbivore treatment. Heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of recombinant PtFPPS1, PtGPPS1.LSU, and PtGPPS2.LSU confirmed their respective IDS activities. Recombinant PtGPPS.SSU1 and PtGPPS.SSU2, however, had no enzymatic activity on their own, but PtGPPS.SSU1 enhanced the GPP synthase activities of PtGPPS1.LSU and PtGPPS2.LSU in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that PtGPPS1.LSU and PtGPPS2.LSU in combination with PtGPPS.SSU1 may provide the substrate for herbivory-induced monoterpene formation in P. trichocarpa. The sole FPP synthase PtFPPS1 likely produces FPP for both primary and specialized metabolism in this plant species.

51,Identification of a Plastid-Localized Bifunctional Nerolidol/Linalool Synthase in Relation to Linalool Biosynthesis in Young Grape Berries,"
Monoterpenoids are a diverse class of natural products and contribute to the important varietal aroma of certain Vitis vinifera grape cultivars. Among the typical monoterpenoids, linalool exists in almost all grape varieties. A gene coding for a nerolidol/linalool (NES/LINS) synthase was evaluated in the role of linalool biosynthesis in grape berries. Enzyme activity assay of this recombinant protein revealed that it could convert geranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate into linalool and nerolidol in vitro, respectively, and thus it was named VvRILinNer. However, localization experiment showed that this enzyme was only localized to chloroplasts, which indicates that VvRILinNer functions in the linalool production in vivo. The patterns of gene expression and linalool accumulation were analyzed in the berries of three grape cultivars (“Riesling”, “Cabernet Sauvignon”, “Gewurztraminer”) with significantly different levels of monoterpenoids. The VvRILinNer was considered to be mainly responsible for the synthesis of linalool at the early developmental stage. This finding has provided us with new knowledge to uncover the complex monoterpene biosynthesis in grapes.

52,Identification of microRNAs from Medicinal Plant Murraya koenigii by High-Throughput Sequencing and Their Functional Implications in Secondary Metabolite Biosynthesis,"
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that play crucial post-transcriptional regulatory roles in plants, including development and stress-response signaling. However, information about their involvement in secondary metabolism is still limited. Murraya koenigii is a popular medicinal plant, better known as curry leaves, that possesses pharmaceutically active secondary metabolites. The present study utilized high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate the miRNA profile of M. koenigii and their association with secondary metabolite biosynthesis. A total of 343,505 unique reads with lengths ranging from 16 to 40 nt were obtained from the sequencing data, among which 142 miRNAs were identified as conserved and 7 as novel miRNAs. Moreover, 6078 corresponding potential target genes of M. koenigii miRNAs were recognized in this study. Interestingly, several conserved and novel miRNAs of M. koenigii were found to target key enzymes of the terpenoid backbone and the flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, to validate the sequencing results, the relative expression of eight randomly selected miRNAs was determined by qPCR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the M. koenigii miRNA profile that may provide useful information for further elucidation of the involvement of miRNAs in secondary metabolism. These findings might be crucial in the future to generate artificial-miRNA-based, genetically engineered M. koenigii plants for the overproduction of medicinally highly valuable secondary metabolites.

53,Integration of Metabolite Profiling and Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Genes Related to Volatile Terpenoid Metabolism in Finger Citron (C. medica var. sarcodactylis),"
Finger citron (Citrus medica var. sarcodactylis) is a popular ornamental tree and an important source of essential oils rich in terpenoids, but the mechanisms behind volatile formation are poorly understood. We investigated gene expression changes combined with volatile profiling of ten samples from three developing organs: flower, leaf, and fruit. A total of 62 volatiles were identified with limonene and ?-terpinene being the most abundant ones. Six volatiles were identified using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) that could be used as markers for distinguishing finger citron from other citrus species. RNA-Seq revealed 1,611,966,118 high quality clean reads that were assembled into 32,579 unigenes. From these a total of 58 terpene synthase (TPS) gene family members were identified and the spatial and temporal distribution of their transcripts was measured in developing organs. Transcript levels of transcription factor genes AP2/ERF (251), bHLH (169), bZIP (76), MYB (155), NAC (184), and WRKY (66) during finger citron development were also analyzed. From extracted subnetworks of three modules constructed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), thirteen TPS genes and fifteen transcription factors were suggested to be related to volatile terpenoid formation. These results provide a framework for future investigations into the identification and regulatory network of terpenoids in finger citron.

Specialized plant terpenoids have found fortuitous uses in medicine due to their evolutionary and biochemical selection for biological activity in animals. However, these highly functionalized natural products are produced through complex biosynthetic pathways for which we have a complete understanding in only a few cases. Here we review some of the most effective and promising plant terpenoids that are currently used in medicine and medical research and provide updates on their biosynthesis, natural occurrence, and mechanism of action in the body. This includes pharmacologically useful plastidic terpenoids such as p-menthane monoterpenoids, cannabinoids, paclitaxel (taxol®), and ingenol mebutate which are derived from the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, as well as cytosolic terpenoids such as thapsigargin and artemisinin produced through the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. We further provide a review of the MEP and MVA precursor pathways which supply the carbon skeletons for the downstream transformations yielding these medically significant natural products.

55,Metabolic Engineering of the Native Monoterpene Pathway in Spearmint for Production of Heterologous Monoterpenes Reveals Complex Metabolism and Pathway Interactions,"
Spearmint produces and stores large amounts of monoterpenes, mainly limonene and carvone, in glandular trichomes and is the major natural source of these compounds. Towards producing heterologous monoterpenes in spearmint, we first reduced the flux into the native limonene pathway by knocking down the expression of limonene synthase (MsLS) by RNAi method. The MsLS RNAi lines exhibited a huge reduction in the synthesis of limonene and carvone. Detailed GC-MS and LC-MS analysis revealed that MsLS RNAi plants also showed an increase in sesquiterpene, phytosterols, fatty acids, flavonoids, and phenolic metabolites, suggesting an interaction between the MEP, MVA shikimate and fatty acid pathways in spearmint. Three different heterologous monoterpene synthases namely, linalool synthase and myrcene synthase from Picea abies and geraniol synthase from Cananga odorata were cloned and introduced independently into the MsLS RNAi mutant background. The expression of these heterologous terpene synthases resulted mainly in production of monoterpene derivatives. Of all the introduced monoterpenes geraniol showed the maximum number of derivatives. Our results provide new insights into MEP pathway interactions and regulation and reveals the existence of mechanisms for complex metabolism of monoterpenes in spearmint.

56,Metabolic Perturbation and Synthetic Biology Strategies for Plant Terpenoid Production—An Updated Overview,"
Terpenoids represent one of the high-value groups of specialized metabolites with vast structural diversity. They exhibit versatile human benefits and have been successfully exploited in several sectors of day-to-day life applications, including cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceuticals. Historically, the potential use of terpenoids is challenging, and highly hampered by their bioavailability in their natural sources. Significant progress has been made in recent years to overcome such challenges by advancing the heterologous production platforms of hosts and metabolic engineering technologies. Herein, we summarize the latest developments associated with analytical platforms, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology, with a focus on two terpenoid classes: monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids. Accumulated data showed that subcellular localization of both the precursor pool and the introduced enzymes were the crucial factors for increasing the production of targeted terpenoids in plants. We believe this timely review provides a glimpse of current state-of-the-art techniques/methodologies related to terpenoid engineering that would facilitate further improvements in terpenoids research.

57,Metabolomics for Evaluating Flavor-Associated Metabolites in Plant-Based Products,"
Plant-based diets (PBDs) are associated with environmental benefits, human health promotion and animal welfare. There is a worldwide shift towards PBDs, evident from the increased global demand for fresh plant-based products (PBPs). Such shifts in dietary preferences accompanied by evolving food palates, create opportunities to leverage technological advancements and strict quality controls in developing PBPs that can drive consumer acceptance. Flavor, color and texture are important sensory attributes of a food product and, have the largest influence on consumer appeal and acceptance. Among these, flavor is considered the most dominating quality attribute that significantly affects overall eating experience. Current state-of-art technologies rely on physicochemical estimations and sensory-based tests to assess flavor-related attributes in fresh PBPs. However, these methodologies often do not provide any indication about the metabolic features associated with unique flavor profiles and, consequently, can be used in a limited way to define the quality attributes of PBPs. To this end, a systematic understanding of metabolites that contribute to the flavor profiles of PBPs is warranted to complement the existing methodologies. This review will discuss the use of metabolomics for evaluating flavor-associated metabolites in fresh PBPs at post-harvest stage, alongside its applications for quality assessment and grading. We will summarize the current research in this area, discuss technical challenges and considerations pertaining to sampling and analytical techniques, as well as s provide future perspectives and directions for government organizations, industries and other stakeholders associated with the quality assessment of fresh PBPs.

58,Nerolidol: A Sesquiterpene Alcohol with Multi-Faceted Pharmacological and Biological Activities,"
Nerolidol (3,7,11-trimethyl-1,6,10-dodecatrien-3-ol) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene alcohol that is present in various plants with a floral odor. It is synthesized as an intermediate in the production of (3E)-4,8-dimethy-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), a herbivore-induced volatile that protects plants from herbivore damage. Chemically, nerolidol exists in two geometric isomers, a trans and a cis form. The usage of nerolidol is widespread across different industries. It has been widely used in cosmetics (e.g., shampoos and perfumes) and in non-cosmetic products (e.g., detergents and cleansers). In fact, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also permitted the use of nerolidol as a food flavoring agent. The fact that nerolidol is a common ingredient in many products has attracted researchers to explore more medicinal properties of nerolidol that may exert beneficial effect on human health. Therefore, the aim of this review is to compile and consolidate the data on the various pharmacological and biological activities displayed by nerolidol. Furthermore, this review also includes pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies of nerolidol.

59,"New Insights on the Terpenome of the Red Seaweed Laurencia dendroidea (Florideophyceae, Rhodophyta)","
The red seaweeds belonging to the genus Laurencia are well known as halogenated secondary metabolites producers, mainly terpenoids and acetogennins. Several of these chemicals exhibit important ecological roles and biotechnological applications. However, knowledge regarding the genes involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds is still very limited. We detected 20 different genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid precursors, and 21 different genes coding for terpene synthases that are responsible for the chemical modifications of the terpenoid precursors, resulting in a high diversity of carbon chemical skeletons. In addition, we demonstrate through molecular and cytochemical approaches the occurrence of the mevalonate pathway involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes in L. dendroidea. This is the first report on terpene synthase genes in seaweeds, enabling further studies on possible heterologous biosynthesis of terpenes from L. dendroidea exhibiting ecological or biotechnological interest.

60,Patchoulol Production with Metabolically Engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum,"
Patchoulol is a sesquiterpene alcohol and an important natural product for the perfume industry. Corynebacterium glutamicum is the prominent host for the fermentative production of amino acids with an average annual production volume of ~6 million tons. Due to its robustness and well established large-scale fermentation, C. glutamicum has been engineered for the production of a number of value-added compounds including terpenoids. Both C40 and C50 carotenoids, including the industrially relevant astaxanthin, and short-chain terpenes such as the sesquiterpene valencene can be produced with this organism. In this study, systematic metabolic engineering enabled construction of a patchoulol producing C. glutamicum strain by applying the following strategies: (i) construction of a farnesyl pyrophosphate-producing platform strain by combining genomic deletions with heterologous expression of ispA from Escherichia coli; (ii) prevention of carotenoid-like byproduct formation; (iii) overproduction of limiting enzymes from the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)-pathway to increase precursor supply; and (iv) heterologous expression of the plant patchoulol synthase gene PcPS from Pogostemon cablin. Additionally, a proof of principle liter-scale fermentation with a two-phase organic overlay-culture medium system for terpenoid capture was performed. To the best of our knowledge, the patchoulol titers demonstrated here are the highest reported to date with up to 60 mg L-1 and volumetric productivities of up to 18 mg L-1 d-1.

61,"Pentacyclic Triterpenoids from the Medicinal Herb, Centella asiatica (L.) Urban","
Centella asiatica accumulates large quantities of pentacyclic triterpenoid saponins, collectively known as centelloids. These terpenoids include asiaticoside, centelloside, madecassoside, brahmoside, brahminoside, thankuniside, sceffoleoside, centellose, asiatic-, brahmic-, centellic- and madecassic acids. The triterpene saponins are common secondary plant metabolites and are synthesized via the isoprenoid pathway to produce a hydrophobic triterpenoid structure (aglycone) containing a hydrophilic sugar chain (glycone). The biological activity of saponins has been attributed to these characteristics. In planta, the Centella triterpenoids can be regarded as phytoanticipins due to their antimicrobial activities and protective role against attempted pathogen infections. Preparations of C. asiatica are used in traditional and alternative medicine due to the wide spectrum of pharmacological activities associated with these secondary metabolites. Here, the biosynthesis of the centelloid triterpenoids is reviewed; the range of metabolites found in C. asiatica, together with their known biological activities and the chemotype variation in the production of these metabolites due to growth conditions are summarized. These plant-derived pharmacologically active compounds have complex structures, making chemical synthesis an economically uncompetitive option. Production of secondary metabolites by cultured cells provides a particularly important benefit to manipulate and improve the production of desired compounds; thus biotechnological approaches to increase the concentrations of the metabolites are discussed.

62,Plant Glandular Trichomes as Targets for Breeding or Engineering of Resistance to Herbivores,"
Glandular trichomes are specialized hairs found on the surface of about 30% of all vascular plants and are responsible for a significant portion of a plant’s secondary chemistry. Glandular trichomes are an important source of essential oils, i.e., natural fragrances or products that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry, although many of these substances have evolved to provide the plant with protection against herbivores and pathogens. The storage compartment of glandular trichomes usually is located on the tip of the hair and is part of the glandular cell, or cells, which are metabolically active. Trichomes and their exudates can be harvested relatively easily, and this has permitted a detailed study of their metabolites, as well as the genes and proteins responsible for them. This knowledge now assists classical breeding programs, as well as targeted genetic engineering, aimed to optimize trichome density and physiology to facilitate customization of essential oil production or to tune biocide activity to enhance crop protection. We will provide an overview of the metabolic diversity found within plant glandular trichomes, with the emphasis on those of the Solanaceae, and of the tools available to manipulate their activities for enhancing the plant’s resistance to pests.

63,"Plant Volatile Organic Compounds Evolution: Transcriptional Regulation, Epigenetics and Polyploidy","
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted by plants as a consequence of their interaction with biotic and abiotic factors, and have a very important role in plant evolution. Floral VOCs are often involved in defense and pollinator attraction. These interactions often change rapidly over time, so a quick response to those changes is required. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, which regulate both genes and transcription factors, might trigger adaptive responses to these evolutionary pressures as well as regulating the rhythmic emission of VOCs through circadian clock regulation. In addition, transgenerational epigenetic effects and whole genome polyploidy could modify the generation of VOCs’ profiles of offspring, contributing to long-term evolutionary shifts. In this article, we review the available knowledge about the mechanisms that may act as epigenetic regulators of the main VOC biosynthetic pathways, and their importance in plant evolution.

64,Profiling of Volatile Compounds and Associated Gene Expression in Two Anthurium Cultivars and Their F1 Hybrid Progenies,"
Anthurium is an important ornamental crop in the world market and its floral scent can enhance its ornamental value. To date, studies of the components and formation mechanism of the floral scent of Anthurium are relatively few. In this study, the scent profiles of two Anthurium varieties were measured by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). There were 32 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in Anthurium ‘Mystral’, and the most abundant compound was eucalyptol (57.5%). Extremely small amounts of VOCs were detected in Anthurium ‘Alabama’. Compared with A. ‘Alabama’, most genes related to floral scent synthesis exhibited a higher expression in A.‘Mystral’, including AaDXS, AaDXR, AaMDS, AaHDS, AaTPS, AaDAHPS, AaADT2, AaPAL1, and AaPAL2. In order to produce new varieties of Anthurium with fragrance, 454 progenies of two crossbred combinations of A. ‘Mystral’ and A. ‘Alabama’ were obtained. Four F1 generation plants with different floral scent intensities were selected for further study. The major components of floral scent in the progenies were similar to that of the parental A.‘Mystral’ plant. The expression patterns of genes related to floral scent synthesis were consistent with the relative contents of different types of VOCs. This study revealed the profiles of volatile compounds and associated gene expression in two Anthurium cultivars and their F1 hybrids, which provided a basis for the floral scent inheritance of Anthurium andraeanum.

Terpenoids play vital roles in tea aroma quality and plants defense performance determination, whereas the scenarios of genes to metabolites of terpenes pathway remain uninvestigated in tea plants. Here, we report the use of an integrated approach combining metabolites, target gene transcripts and function analyses to reveal a gene-to-terpene network in tea plants. Forty-one terpenes including 26 monoterpenes, 14 sesquiterpenes and one triterpene were detected and 82 terpenes related genes were identified from five tissues of tea plants. Pearson correlation analysis resulted in genes to metabolites network. One terpene synthases whose expression positively correlated with farnesene were selected and its function was confirmed involved in the biosynthesis of a-farnesene, ß-ocimene and ß-farnesene, a very important and conserved alarm pheromone in response to aphids by both in vitro enzymatic assay in planta function analysis. In summary, we provided the first reliable gene-to-terpene network for novel genes discovery.

66,"Secretory Products in Petals of Centaurea cyanus L. Flowers: A Histochemistry, Ultrastructure, and Phytochemical Study of Volatile Compounds","
(1) Background: Centaurea cyanus L. is a medicinal plant whose flowers are widely used in herbal medicine. The aim of the study was to localise flower tissues that are responsible for the production of secretory products in petals and to analyse the volatile compounds. The volatile compounds of the flowers of this species have not been investigated to date. (2) Methods: Light, fluorescence, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were used in the study. Lipophilic compounds were localised in the tissues using histochemical assays. Volatile compounds were determined with the use of solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). (3) Results: The study showed production of secretion in the petal parenchyma, whose ultrastructure has features of a secretory tissue. The lipophilic secretion was localised in the cells and intercellular spaces of the parenchyma and in the walls and surface of epidermal cells, where it accumulated after release through cuticle microchannels. Sesquiterpenes were found to constitute the main group of volatile compounds, with the highest content of ß-caryophyllene (26.17%) and a-humulene (9.77%). (4) Conclusions: Given the presence of some volatile components that are often found in resins (caryophyllene, delta-cadinene) and the abundant secretion residues on the epidermal surface, we suppose that the C. cyanus secretion released by the flowers is a resinaceous mixture (oleoresin), which is frequently found in plants, as shown by literature data. This secretion may play an important role in the therapeutic effects of C. cyanus flowers.

67,Seeing the Forest through the (Phylogenetic) Trees: Functional Characterisation of Grapevine Terpene Synthase (VviTPS) Paralogues and Orthologues,"
Gene families involved in specialised metabolism play a key role in a myriad of ecophysiological and biochemical functions. The Vitis vinifera sesquiterpene synthases represent the largest subfamily of grapevine terpene synthase (VviTPS) genes and are important volatile metabolites for wine flavour and aroma, as well as ecophysiological interactions. The functional characterisation of VviTPS genes is complicated by a reliance on a single reference genome that greatly underrepresents this large gene family, exacerbated by extensive duplications and paralogy. The recent release of multiple phased diploid grapevine genomes, as well as extensive whole-genome resequencing efforts, provide a wealth of new sequence information that can be utilised to overcome the limitations of the reference genome. A large cluster of sesquiterpene synthases, localised to chromosome 18, was explored by means of comparative sequence analyses using the publicly available grapevine reference genome, three PacBio phased diploid genomes and whole-genome resequencing data from multiple genotypes. Two genes, VviTPS04 and -10, were identified as putative paralogues and/or allelic variants. Subsequent gene isolation from multiple grapevine genotypes and characterisation by means of a heterologous in planta expression and volatile analysis resulted in the identification of genotype-specific structural variations and polymorphisms that impact the gene function. These results present novel insight into how grapevine domestication likely shaped the VviTPS landscape to result in genotype-specific functions.

69,Taxonomic Insights and Its Type Cyclization Correlation of Volatile Sesquiterpenes in Vitex Species and Potential Source Insecticidal Compounds: A Review,"
Sesquiterpenes (SS) are secondary metabolites formed by the bonding of 3 isoprene (C5) units. They play an important role in the defense and signaling of plants to adapt to the environment, face stress, and communicate with the outside world, and their evolutionary history is closely related to their physiological functions. This review considers their presence and extensively summarizes the 156 sesquiterpenes identified in Vitextaxa, emphasizing those with higher concentrations and frequency among species and correlating with the insecticidal activities and defensive responses reported in the literature. In addition, we classify the SS based on their chemical structures and addresses cyclization in biosynthetic origin. Most relevant sesquiterpenes of the Vitex genus are derived from the germacredienyl cation mainly via bicyclogermacrene and germacrene C, giving rise to aromadrendanes, a skeleton with the highest number of representative compounds in this genus, and 6,9-guaiadiene, respectively, indicating the production of 1.10-cyclizing sesquiterpene synthases. These enzymes can play an important role in the chemosystematics of the genus from their corresponding routes and cyclizations, constituting a new approach to chemotaxonomy. In conclusion, this review is a compilation of detailed information on the profile of sesquiterpene in the Vitex genus and, thus, points to new unexplored horizons for future research.

70,Terpenes and Terpenoids in Plants: Interactions with Environment and Insects,"
The interactions of plants with environment and insects are bi-directional and dynamic. Consequently, a myriad of mechanisms has evolved to engage organisms in different types of interactions. These interactions can be mediated by allelochemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which include volatile terpenes (VTs). The emission of VTs provides a way for plants to communicate with the environment, including neighboring plants, beneficiaries (e.g., pollinators, seed dispersers), predators, parasitoids, and herbivores, by sending enticing or deterring signals. Understanding terpenoid distribution, biogenesis, and function provides an opportunity for the design and implementation of effective and efficient environmental calamity and pest management strategies. This review provides an overview of plant–environment and plant–insect interactions in the context of terpenes and terpenoids as important chemical mediators of these abiotic and biotic interactions.

71,Structure of 2-Methylisoborneol Synthase from Streptomyces coelicolor and Implications for the Cyclization of a Noncanonical C-Methylated Monoterpenoid Substrate,"The crystal structure of 2-methylisoborneol synthase (MIBS) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) has been determined in complex with substrate analogues geranyl-S-thiolodiphosphate and 2-fluorogeranyl diphosphate at 1.80 and 1.95 Å resolution, respectively. This terpenoid cyclase catalyzes the cyclization of the naturally occurring, noncanonical C-methylated isoprenoid substrate, 2-methylgeranyl diphosphate, to form the bicyclic product 2-methylisoborneol, a volatile C11 homoterpene alcohol with an earthy, musty odor. While MIBS adopts the tertiary structure of a class I terpenoid cyclase, its dimeric quaternary structure differs from that previously observed in dimeric terpenoid cyclases from plants and fungi. The quaternary structure of MIBS is nonetheless similar in some respects to that of dimeric farnesyl diphosphate synthase, which is not a cyclase. The structures of MIBS complexed with substrate analogues provide insights regarding differences in the catalytic mechanism of MIBS and the mechanisms of (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase and endo-fenchol synthase, plant cyclases that convert geranyl diphosphate into products with closely related bicyclic bornyl skeletons, but distinct structures and stereochemistries.",the crystal structure methylisoborneol synthase mibs streptomyces coelicolor a determined complex substrate analogue geranyl s thiolodiphosphate fluorogeranyl diphosphate resolution respectively this terpenoid cyclase catalyzes cyclization naturally occurring noncanonical c methylated isoprenoid substrate methylgeranyl diphosphate form bicyclic product methylisoborneol volatile c homoterpene alcohol earthy musty odor while mibs adopts tertiary structure class i terpenoid cyclase dimeric quaternary structure differs previously observed dimeric terpenoid cyclases plant fungi the quaternary structure mibs nonetheless similar respect dimeric farnesyl diphosphate synthase cyclase the structure mibs complexed substrate analogue provide insight regarding difference catalytic mechanism mibs mechanism bornyl diphosphate synthase endo fenchol synthase plant cyclases convert geranyl diphosphate product closely related bicyclic bornyl skeleton distinct structure stereochemistries,low
72,Terpenoids: Opportunities for Biosynthesis of Natural Product Drugs Using Engineered Microorganisms,"Terpenoids represent a diverse class of molecules that provide a wealth of opportunities to address many human health and societal issues. The expansive array of structures and functionalities that have been evolved in nature provide an excellent pool of molecules for use in human therapeutics. While this class of molecules has members with therapeutic properties including anticancer, antiparasitic, antimicrobial, antiallergenic, antispasmodic, antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, supply limitations prevent the large scale use of some molecules. Many of these molecules are only found in ppm levels in nature thus requiring massive harvesting to obtain sufficient amounts of the drug. Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering provide innovative approaches to increase the production of the desired molecule in the native organism, and most importantly, transfer the biosynthetic pathways to other hosts. Microbial systems are well studied, and genetic manipulations allow the optimization of microbial metabolisms for the production of common terpenoid precursors. Using a host of tools, unprecedented advancements in the large scale production of terpenoids have been achieved in recent years. Identification of limiting steps and pathway regulation, coupled with design strategies to minimize terpenoid byproducts wih a high flux to the desired biosynthetic pathways, have yielded greater than 100-fold improvements in the production of a range of terpenoids.

73,A Genome-Wide Scenario of Terpene Pathways in Self-pollinated Artemisia annua,"Abstract

Scenarios of genes to metabolites in Artemisia annua remain uninvestigated. Here, we report the use of an integrated approach combining metabolomics, transcriptomics, and gene function analyses to characterize gene-to-terpene and terpene pathway scenarios in a self-pollinating variety of this species. Eighty-eight metabolites including 22 sesquiterpenes (e.g., artemisinin), 26 monoterpenes, two triterpenes, one diterpene and 38 other non-polar metabolites were identified from 14 tissues. These metabolites were differentially produced by leaves and flowers at lower to higher positions. Sequences from cDNA libraries of six tissues were assembled into 18 871 contigs and genome-wide gene expression profiles in tissues were strongly associated with developmental stages and spatial specificities. Sequence mining identified 47 genes that mapped to the artemisinin, non-amorphadiene sesquiterpene, monoterpene, triterpene, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate and mevalonate pathways. Pearson correlation analysis resulted in network integration that characterized significant correlations of gene-to-gene expression patterns and gene expression-to-metabolite levels in six tissues simultaneously. More importantly, manipulations of amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene expression not only affected the activity of this pathway toward artemisinin, artemisinic acid, and arteannuin b but also altered non-amorphadiene sesquiterpene and genome-wide volatile profiles.

74,A monoterpene synthase gene cluster of tea plant (Camellia sinensis) potentially involved in constitutive and herbivore-induced terpene formation,"Abstract

Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the most abundant volatiles in tea plants and have dual functions in aroma quality formation and defense responses in tea plants. Terpene synthases (TPS) are the key enzymes for the synthesis of terpenes in plants; however, the functions of most of them in tea plants are still unknown. In this study, six putative terpene biosynthesis gene clusters were identified from the tea plant genome. Then we cloned three new TPS-b subfamily genes, CsTPS08, CsTPS10 and CsTPS58. In vitro enzyme assays showed that CsTPS08 and CsTPS58 are two multiple-product terpene synthases, with the former synthesizing linalool as the main product, and ß-myrcene, a-phellandrene, a-terpinolene, D-limonene, cis-ß-ocimene, trans-ß-ocimene and (4E,6Z)-allo-ocimene as minor products are also detected, while the latter catalyzing the formation of a-pinene and D-limonene using GPP as the substrate. No product of CsTPS10 was detected in the prokaryotic expression system, but geraniol production was detected when transiently expressed in tobacco leaves. CsTPS08 and CsTPS10 are two functional members of a monoterpene synthase gene cluster, which were significantly induced during both Ectropis oblique feeding and fresh leaf spreading treatments, suggesting that they have dual functions involved in tea plant pest defense and tea aroma quality regulation. In addition, the differences in their expression levels in different tea plant cultivars provide a possibility for the subsequent screening of tea plant resources with a specific aroma flavor.

75,A raison d’être for two distinct pathways in the early steps of plant isoprenoid biosynthesis?,"Abstract

When compared to other organisms, plants are atypical with respect to isoprenoid biosynthesis: they utilize two distinct and separately compartmentalized pathways to build up isoprene units. The co-existence of these pathways in the cytosol and in plastids might permit the synthesis of many vital compounds, being essential for a sessile organism. While substrate exchange across membranes has been shown for a variety of plant species, lack of complementation of strong phenotypes, resulting from inactivation of either the cytosolic pathway (growth and development defects) or the plastidial pathway (pigment bleaching), seems to be surprising at first sight. Hundreds of isoprenoids have been analyzed to determine their biosynthetic origins. It can be concluded that in angiosperms, under standard growth conditions, C20-phytyl moieties, C30-triterpenes and C40-carotenoids are made nearly exclusively within compartmentalized pathways, while mixed origins are widespread for other types of isoprenoid-derived molecules. It seems likely that this coexistence is essential for the interaction of plants with their environment. A major purpose of this review is to summarize such observations, especially within an ecological and functional context and with some emphasis on regulation. This latter aspect still requires more work and present conclusions are preliminary, although some general features seem to exist.",abstract when compared organism plant atypical respect isoprenoid biosynthesis utilize two distinct separately compartmentalized pathway build isoprene unit the co existence pathway cytosol plastid might permit synthesis many vital compound essential sessile organism while substrate exchange across membrane shown variety plant specie lack complementation strong phenotype resulting inactivation either cytosolic pathway growth development defect plastidial pathway pigment bleaching seems surprising first sight hundreds isoprenoids analyzed determine biosynthetic origin it concluded angiosperm standard growth condition c phytyl moiety c triterpenes c carotenoid made nearly exclusively within compartmentalized pathway mixed origin widespread type isoprenoid derived molecule it seems likely coexistence essential interaction plant environment a major purpose review summarize observation especially within ecological functional context emphasis regulation this latter aspect still requires work present conclusion preliminary although general feature seem exist,low
76,A review on microbial synthesis of hydrocarbons,"Abstract

Review summarizes comparative data on the intracellular hydrocarbons of different microorganisms (cyanobacteria, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and mycelial fungi). Certain systematic groups of microorganisms are characterized by specific composition of intracellular hydrocarbons, in particular, cyanobacteria are unique in their ability to produce 7- and 8-methylheptadecanes; photosynthetic bacteria are distinguished by the synthesis of cyclic hydrocarbons (pristane and phytane), whereas in fungi, long-chain hydrocarbons are predominant. The synthesis of hydrocarbons by microorganisms depends considerably on the growth conditions that provides a way for its physiological regulation. The processes for microbiological production of extracellular aliphatic and volatile non-methane hydrocarbons are exemplified. Pathways for the biosynthesis of straight chain-, branched-, volatile non-methane hydrocarbons, and isoprenoids are described. Mechanisms of the hydrocarbon synthesis appear to be different in various microorganisms. The role of hydrocarbons in microorganisms is discussed.",abstract review summarizes comparative data intracellular hydrocarbon different microorganism cyanobacteria aerobic anaerobic bacteria yeast mycelial fungi certain systematic group microorganism characterized specific composition intracellular hydrocarbon particular cyanobacteria unique ability produce methylheptadecanes photosynthetic bacteria distinguished synthesis cyclic hydrocarbon pristane phytane whereas fungi long chain hydrocarbon predominant the synthesis hydrocarbon microorganism depends considerably growth condition provides way physiological regulation the process microbiological production extracellular aliphatic volatile non methane hydrocarbon exemplified pathways biosynthesis straight chain branched volatile non methane hydrocarbon isoprenoids described mechanisms hydrocarbon synthesis appear different various microorganism the role hydrocarbon microorganism discussed,low
77,"Advances in biosynthesis, regulation, and metabolic engineering of plant specialized terpenoids","Abstract

Plant specialized terpenoids are natural products that have no obvious role in growth and development, but play many important functional roles to improve the plant’s overall fitness. Besides, plant specialized terpenoids have immense value to humans due to their applications in fragrance, flavor, cosmetic, and biofuel industries. Understanding the fundamental aspects involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of these high-value molecules in plants not only paves the path to enhance plant traits, but also facilitates homologous or heterologous engineering for overproduction of target molecules of importance. Recent developments in functional genomics and high-throughput analytical techniques have led to unraveling of several novel aspects involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of plant specialized terpenoids. The knowledge thus derived has been successfully utilized to produce target specialized terpenoids of plant origin in homologous or heterologous host systems by metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches.

78,Alternative Carbon Sources for Isoprene Emission,"Isoprene and other plastidial isoprenoids are produced primarily from recently assimilated photosynthates via the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. However, when environmental conditions limit photosynthesis, a fraction of carbon for MEP pathway can come from extrachloroplastic sources. The flow of extrachloroplastic carbon depends on the species and on leaf developmental and environmental conditions. The exchange of common phosphorylated intermediates between the MEP pathway and other metabolic pathways can occur via plastidic phosphate translocators. C1 and C2 carbon intermediates can contribute to chloroplastic metabolism, including photosynthesis and isoprenoid synthesis. Integration of these metabolic processes provide an example of metabolic flexibility, and results in the synthesis of primary metabolites for plant growth and secondary metabolites for plant defense, allowing effective use of environmental resources under multiple stresses.",isoprene plastidial isoprenoids produced primarily recently assimilated photosynthates via c methyl d erythritol phosphate mep pathway however environmental condition limit photosynthesis fraction carbon mep pathway come extrachloroplastic source the flow extrachloroplastic carbon depends specie leaf developmental environmental condition the exchange common phosphorylated intermediate mep pathway metabolic pathway occur via plastidic phosphate translocators c c carbon intermediate contribute chloroplastic metabolism including photosynthesis isoprenoid synthesis integration metabolic process provide example metabolic flexibility result synthesis primary metabolite plant growth secondary metabolite plant defense allowing effective use environmental resource multiple stress,high

Aphids are important agricultural and forest pests that exhibit complex behaviors elicited by pheromonal signals. The aphid alarm pheromone – of which (E)-ß-farnesene is the key (or only) component in most species – plays important roles in mediating interactions among individuals as well as multitrophic interactions among plants, aphids, and aphid natural enemies. Though many important questions remain to be answered, a large body of research has addressed various aspects of the biology, physiology, and ecology of aphid alarm pheromones. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of (a) the identity and composition of aphid alarm signals; (b) their biosynthesis and production; (c) their effects on conspecifics; (d) their role as cues for other insect species; and (e) their potential application for the management of pest organisms.",abstract aphids important agricultural forest pest exhibit complex behavior elicited pheromonal signal the aphid alarm pheromone e farnesene key component specie play important role mediating interaction among individual well multitrophic interaction among plant aphid aphid natural enemy though many important question remain answered large body research addressed various aspect biology physiology ecology aphid alarm pheromone here review recent advance understanding identity composition aphid alarm signal b biosynthesis production c effect conspecific role cue insect specie e potential application management pest organism,low

82,Artemisinin biosynthesis in growing plants of Artemisia annua. A 13CO2 study,"Abstract

Artemisinin from Artemisia annua has become one of the most important drugs for malaria therapy. Its biosynthesis proceeds via amorpha-4,11-diene, but it is still unknown whether the isoprenoid precursors units are obtained by the mevalonate pathway or the more recently discovered non-mevalonate pathway. In order to address that question, a plant of A. annua was grown in an atmosphere containing 700 ppm of 13CO2 for 100 min. Following a chase period of 10 days, artemisinin was isolated and analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The isotopologue pattern shows that artemisinin was predominantly biosynthesized from (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) whose central isoprenoid unit had been obtained via the non-mevalonate pathway. The isotopologue data confirm the previously proposed mechanisms for the cyclization of (E,E)-FPP to amorphadiene and its oxidative conversion to artemisinin. They also support deprotonation of a terminal allyl cation intermediate as the final step in the enzymatic conversion of FPP to amorphadiene and show that either of the two methyl groups can undergo deprotonation.",abstract artemisinin artemisia annua become one important drug malaria therapy its biosynthesis proceeds via amorpha diene still unknown whether isoprenoid precursor unit obtained mevalonate pathway recently discovered non mevalonate pathway in order address question plant a annua grown atmosphere containing ppm co min following chase period day artemisinin isolated analyzed c nmr spectroscopy the isotopologue pattern show artemisinin predominantly biosynthesized e e farnesyl diphosphate fpp whose central isoprenoid unit obtained via non mevalonate pathway the isotopologue data confirm previously proposed mechanism cyclization e e fpp amorphadiene oxidative conversion artemisinin they also support deprotonation terminal allyl cation intermediate final step enzymatic conversion fpp amorphadiene show either two methyl group undergo deprotonation,low
83,Attracting friends to feast on foes: engineering terpene emission to make crop plants more attractive to herbivore enemies,"Abstract

When attacked by herbivorous insects or mites, some plant species call on other arthropods for help. They emit mixtures of volatile compounds, dominated by terpenes, to attract carnivorous arthropods that prey on or parasitise herbivores and so reduce further damage. This fascinating defence strategy offers a new, environmentally friendly approach to crop protection. Using recent advances in the biochemistry and molecular genetics of terpene biosynthesis, it should now be possible to engineer crop plants that release terpenes for attracting herbivore enemies. By introducing or selectively altering the existing rate of terpene emission and composition, plant breeders could enable attacked plants to attract enemies and reduce additional herbivory, without compromising the effectiveness of other modes of defence.",abstract when attacked herbivorous insect mite plant specie call arthropod help they emit mixture volatile compound dominated terpene attract carnivorous arthropod prey parasitise herbivore reduce damage this fascinating defence strategy offer new environmentally friendly approach crop protection using recent advance biochemistry molecular genetics terpene biosynthesis possible engineer crop plant release terpene attracting herbivore enemy by introducing selectively altering existing rate terpene emission composition plant breeder could enable attacked plant attract enemy reduce additional herbivory without compromising effectiveness mode defence,low
84,Biochemical and functional characterization of two microbial type terpene synthases from moss Stereodon subimponens,"Abstract

Terpenes constitute a large class of plant secondary metabolites. Usually, there is only one type of terpene synthase in seed plants, which is called typical plant terpene synthase. Currently, as a new family of plant terpene synthases, microbial terpene synthase-like (MTPSL) is identificated in nonseed plants. However, our knowledge about the biological function of most MTPSLs in nonseed plants is very limited. Here, we investigated the biochemical and functional characterization of the enzymes encoded by two MTPSLs from moss Stereodon subimponens, SsMTPSL1 and SsMTPSL2. A phylogenetic tree analysis showed that SsMTPSL1 and SsMTPSL2 are homologous to AaMTPSL1, AaMTPSL3, ApMTPSL1, and ApMTPSL3 from hornworts. The enzyme activity experiment demonstrated that SsMTPSL1 has monoterpene synthase and sesquiterpene synthase activity, and SsMTPSL2 has monoterpene synthase activity. Next, we selected SsMTPSL1 to study its biochemical functions. Anti-bacterial activity test in vitro showed that the products of SsMTPSL1 have an anti-bacterial effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000), and Staphylococcus aureus. To further understand the function of SsMTPSL1, the transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plant of SsMTPSL1 is inoculated by Pst DC3000, and the result showed that SsMTPSL1 enhances the resistance of A. thaliana to Pst DC3000.

85,Biochemistry of Terpenoids,"Publisher Summary

Terpenes are diverse group of compounds, and are found in complex mixtures. They are lipids and frequently unstable. New techniques for purifying and analyzing natural products and determining structures, as well as improved techniques in plant enzymology, have produced rapid progress in this field recently. The facts that many of the enzymes of terpene metabolism are membrane-bound and that the terpenes themselves are hydrophobic, still present problems, and demand new advances in methodology. It has been a common assumption that secondary products are end products of sluggish metabolic pathways. As a result, tracer experiments have often involved incorporation periods from 24 hours to several days. However, results indicate that terpene metabolism in plants is much more dynamic and synthesis and turnover might occur within minutes. A full understanding of the biochemistry of terpenoids in plants requires an interdisciplinary effort, combining organic chemistry, bio-chemistry, plant physiology, plant anatomy, and the applied sciences. The conventional segregation of scientific disciplines has been one of the factors impeding progress in this area.",publisher summary terpenes diverse group compound found complex mixture they lipid frequently unstable new technique purifying analyzing natural product determining structure well improved technique plant enzymology produced rapid progress field recently the fact many enzyme terpene metabolism membrane bound terpene hydrophobic still present problem demand new advance methodology it common assumption secondary product end product sluggish metabolic pathway as result tracer experiment often involved incorporation period hour several day however result indicate terpene metabolism plant much dynamic synthesis turnover might occur within minute a full understanding biochemistry terpenoids plant requires interdisciplinary effort combining organic chemistry bio chemistry plant physiology plant anatomy applied science the conventional segregation scientific discipline one factor impeding progress area,high

Isoprenoids represent the oldest class of known low molecular-mass natural products synthesized by plants. Their biogenesis in plastids, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum–cytosol proceed invariably from the C5 building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate and/or dimethylallyl diphosphate according to complex and reiterated mechanisms. Compounds derived from the pathway exhibit a diverse spectrum of biological functions. This review centers on advances obtained in the field based on combined use of biochemical, molecular biology and genetic approaches.

87,Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds and Their Impacts on Biosphere–Atmosphere Interactions,"Abstract

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) play a critical role in biosphere–atmosphere interactions and are key constraints of the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere, potentially influencing the climate and the quality of air, especially in the areas exposed to in situ release or long-range transport of anthropogenically polluted air masses. Under these conditions, reactive BVOC may contribute to ozone and particle production. The very large amount of BVOC emitted by vegetation, estimated today to more than 1000 Tg C annually, is dominated by methanol and isoprenoids, released predominantly by forest species. Such a high rate of emission implies a large metabolic cost and hence likely indicates very important plant functional roles for these compounds. BVOC can be emitted by plants constitutively, or the emission may be induced in response to biotic and abiotic factors. Both constitutive and induced isoprenoids often act as defensive compounds and are crucial for plant protection in stressful environments. The importance of volatile isoprenoids as protecting molecules has been widely discussed. However, based on the use of genetically modified plants and novel technologies that allow detection of BVOC oxidation products, the idea is emerging that especially volatile isoprenoids act as antioxidants in planta, whereas they contribute to the oxidation potential of the atmosphere.",abstract biogenic volatile organic compound bvoc play critical role biosphere atmosphere interaction key constraint physical chemical property atmosphere potentially influencing climate quality air especially area exposed situ release long range transport anthropogenically polluted air mass under condition reactive bvoc may contribute ozone particle production the large amount bvoc emitted vegetation estimated today tg c annually dominated methanol isoprenoids released predominantly forest specie such high rate emission implies large metabolic cost hence likely indicates important plant functional role compound bvoc emitted plant constitutively emission may induced response biotic abiotic factor both constitutive induced isoprenoids often act defensive compound crucial plant protection stressful environment the importance volatile isoprenoids protecting molecule widely discussed however based use genetically modified plant novel technology allow detection bvoc oxidation product idea emerging especially volatile isoprenoids act antioxidant planta whereas contribute oxidation potential atmosphere,low
88,Biogenic volatile organic compounds in different ecosystems in Southern Kenya,"Abstract

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) have an important impact on atmospheric chemistry. Mixing ratio of BVOCs in different ecosystems have been measured and discussed in detail in recent decades. However, field measurements from tropical Africa remain scarce. In this study, we present the mixing ratio of BVOCs, including isoprene, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenes, bornylacetate, and 2–methyl–3–buten–2–ol from typical forests, bushlands, grasslands and agricultural ecosystems in Taita Taveta County, southern Kenya. The measurements were conducted in April 2019 during the end of the dry season. The total BVOC mixing ratios in forest, agricultural, bushland and grassland ecosystems were 913 ± 183 pptv, 1094 ± 179 pptv, 751 ± 47 pptv and 886 ± 95 pptv, respectively. Isoprene represented 76%, 86%, 91% and 85%, respectively, of total mixing ratios. Monoterpenoids represented in 23%, 14%, 8% and 14% of total mixing ratios, respectively. Monoterpenoid have strong effect on the total BVOC mixing ratios, especially at the certain landscape (i.e. wattletree, pine and cypress forest, and dry grassland). The monoterpenoids were dominated by a–pinene, limonene and ß–pinene in all of the ecosystems.

89,Biosynthesis of andrographolide in Andrographis paniculata,"Abstract

Andrographolide, a diterpene lactone, is isolated from Andrographis paniculata which is well known for its medicinal properties. The biosynthetic route to andrographolide was studied using [1-13C]acetate, [2-13C]acetate and [1,6-13C2]glucose. The peak enrichment of eight carbon atoms in the 13C NMR spectra of andrographolide suggested that deoxyxylulose pathway (DXP) is the major biosynthetic pathway to this diterpene.

The contribution of the mevalonic acid pathway (MVA) is indicated by the observed 13C-labeling pattern, and because the labeling patterns indicate a simultaneous contribution of both methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) and MVA pathways it can be deduced that cross-talk occurs between plastids and cytoplasm.",abstract andrographolide diterpene lactone isolated andrographis paniculata well known medicinal property the biosynthetic route andrographolide studied using c acetate c acetate c glucose the peak enrichment eight carbon atom c nmr spectrum andrographolide suggested deoxyxylulose pathway dxp major biosynthetic pathway diterpene the contribution mevalonic acid pathway mva indicated observed c labeling pattern labeling pattern indicate simultaneous contribution methyl erythritol phosphate mep mva pathway deduced cross talk occurs plastid cytoplasm,low
90,Biosynthesis of mono- and sesquiterpenes in carrot roots and leaves (Daucus carota L.): metabolic cross talk of cytosolic mevalonate and plastidial methylerythritol phosphate pathways,"Abstract

The biosynthesis of the monoterpenes terpinolene and myrcene and the sesquiterpene ß-caryophyllene in roots and leaves of two carrot varieties (Daucus carota L. cultivars Bolero and Kazan) were investigated by in vivo feeding experiments with [5,5-2H2]-mevalonic acid lactone (d2-MVL) and [5,5-2H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose (d2-DOX). The volatiles of the tissues were extracted by stir bar sorptive extraction and analyzed using thermal desorption–multidimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The experiments demonstrate independent de novo-biosynthesis of terpenoids in carrot roots and in carrot leaves. In both plant tissues monoterpenes are biosynthesized exclusively via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose/2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathway, whereas sesquiterpenes are generated by the classical mevalonic acid pathway as well as by the DOXP/MEP route.

ß-caryophyllene is a common sesquiterpene compound currently being studied as a promising precursor for the production of high-density fuels. Acute demand for high-density fuels has provided the impetus to pursue biosynthetic methods to produce ß-caryophyllene from reproducible sources. In this study, we produced ß-caryophyllene by assembling a biosynthetic pathway in an engineered Escherichia coli strain of which phosphoglucose isomerase gene has been deleted. The 1- deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) or heterologous mevalonate (MVA) pathways were employed. Meanwhile, geranyl diphosphate synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ß-caryophyllene synthase genes were co-overexpressed in the above strain. The final genetically modified strain, YJM59, produced 220 ± 6 mg/L of ß-caryophyllene in flask culture. We also evaluated the use of fed-batch fermentation for the production of ß-caryophyllene. After induction for 60 h, the YJM59 strain produced ß-caryophyllene at a concentration of 1520 mg/L. The volumetric production fermented in the aerobic fed-batch was 0.34 mg/(L·h·OD600) and the conversion efficiency of glucose to ß-caryophyllene (gram to gram) was 1.69%.

Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (TEAS) serves as an useful model for understanding the enzyme mechanisms of sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Despite extensive bio-chemical and structural characterization of TEAS, a more detailed analysis of the reaction product spectrum is lacking. This study reports the discovery and quantification of several alternative sesquiterpene products generated by recombinant TEAS in the single-vial GC–MS assay. The combined use of chiral and non-polar stationary phases for gas chromatography separations proved critical for resolving the numerous sesquiterpene products of TEAS for mass spectral analysis and identification. Co-injection studies with available authentic standards from both synthetic and natural sources further corroborated the assignment of several compounds, resulting in an annotated reaction mechanism accounting for their biosynthesis.

95,Both methylerythritol phosphate and mevalonate pathways contribute to biosynthesis of each of the major isoprenoid classes in young cotton seedlings,"Abstract

In higher plants, both the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and mevalonate (MVA) pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. However, despite a significant amount of research on the activity of these pathways under different conditions, the relative contribution of each to the biosynthesis of diverse isoprenoids remains unclear. In this work, we examined the formation of several classes of isoprenoids in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). After feeding [5,5-2H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose ([5,5-2H2]DOX) and [2-13C]MVA to intact cotton seedlings hydroponically, incorporation into isoprenoids was analyzed by MS and NMR. The predominant pattern of incorporation followed the classical scheme in which C5 units from the MEP pathway were used to form monoterpenes (C10), phytol side chains (C20) and carotenoids (C40) while C5 units from the MVA pathway were used to form sesquiterpenes (C15), terpenoid aldehydes (C15 and C25) and steroids/triterpenoids (C30). However, both pathways contributed to all classes of terpenoids, sometimes substantially. For example, the MEP pathway provided up to 20% of the substrate for sterols and the MVA pathway provided as much as 50% of the substrate for phytol side chains and carotenoids.

96,C6-Green leaf volatiles trigger local and systemic VOC emissions in tomato,"Abstract

In response to insect feeding, tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) release elevated levels of volatile organic compounds; that is, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are released both locally and systemically with wounding while C6 green leaf volatiles are released only from damaged leaves. With the exogenous application (100 nmol) of the C6-tomato-volatile (E)-2-hexenal, an increase in the release of local and systemic terpenes was observed, while an equimolar amount of methyl jasmonate triggered only local emissions of terpenes. Labeling studies with 13CO2 showed that de novo synthesis was not required for monoterpene or sesquiterpene release immediately following chemical treatment or insect feeding. Comparative measurements were made between aldehyde doses applied to the plant and levels naturally released from leaves with insect damage.",abstract in response insect feeding tomato plant lycopersicon esculentum release elevated level volatile organic compound monoterpenes sesquiterpenes released locally systemically wounding c green leaf volatile released damaged leaf with exogenous application nmol c tomato volatile e hexenal increase release local systemic terpene observed equimolar amount methyl jasmonate triggered local emission terpene labeling study co showed de novo synthesis required monoterpene sesquiterpene release immediately following chemical treatment insect feeding comparative measurement made aldehyde dos applied plant level naturally released leaf insect damage,low
97,"Carotenoid biofortification in crop plants: citius, altius, fortius","Abstract

Carotenoids are indispensable for human health, required as precursors of vitamin A and efficient antioxidants. However, these plant pigments that play a vital role in photosynthesis are represented at insufficient levels in edible parts of several crops, which creates a need for increasing their content or optimizing their composition through biofortification. In particular, vitamin A deficiency, a severe health problem affecting the lives of millions in developing countries, has triggered the development of a series of high-provitamin A crops, including Golden Rice as the best-known example. Further carotenoid-biofortified crops have been generated by using genetic engineering approaches or through classical breeding. In this review, we depict carotenoid metabolism in plants and provide an update on the development of carotenoid-biofortified plants and their potential to meet needs and expectations. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of using natural variation for carotenoid biofortification and the potential of gene editing tools.

98,"cDNA Cloning, Characterization, and Functional Expression of Four New Monoterpene Synthase Members of the Tpsd Gene Family from Grand Fir (Abies grandis)","Abstract

Grand fir (Abies grandis) is a useful model system for studying the biochemistry, molecular genetics, and regulation of defensive oleoresin formation in conifers, a process involving both the constitutive accumulation of resin (pitch) in specialized secretory structures and the induced biosynthesis of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (turpentine) and diterpene resin acids (rosin) by nonspecialized cells at the site of injury. A similarity-based cloning strategy, employing primers designed to conserved regions of existing monoterpene synthases and anticipated to amplify a 1000-bp fragment, unexpectedly yielded a 300-bp fragment with sequence reminiscent of a terpenoid synthase. Utilization of this amplicon as a hybridization probe afforded four new, full-length cDNA species from a wounded fir stem cDNA library that appeared to encode four distinct monoterpene synthases. Expression in Escherichia coli, followed by enzyme assay with geranyl diphosphate (C10), farnesyl diphosphate (C15) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C20), and analysis of the terpene products by chiral phase gas chromatography and mass spectrometry confirmed that these sequences encoded four new monoterpene synthases, including (-)-camphene synthase, (-)-ß-phellandrene synthase, terpinolene synthase, and an enzyme that produces both (-)-limonene and (-)-a-pinene. The deduced amino acid sequences indicated these enzymes to be 618 to 637 residues in length (71 to 73 kDa) and to be translated as preproteins bearing an amino-terminal plastid targeting sequence of 50–60 residues. cDNA truncation to delete the transit peptide allowed functional expression of the “pseudomature” forms of these enzymes, which exhibited no change in product outcome as a result of truncation. Sequence comparison revealed that these new monoterpene synthases from grand fir are members of the Tpsd gene subfamily and resemble sesquiterpene (C15) synthases and diterpene (C20) synthases from conifers more closely than mechanistically related monoterpene synthases from angiosperm species. The availability of a nearly complete set of constitutive and inducible monoterpene synthases from grand fir (now numbering seven) will allow molecular dissection of the resin-based defense response in this conifer species, and detailed study of structure–function relationships among this large and diverse family of catalysts, all of which exploit the same stereochemistry in the coupled isomerization–cyclization reaction.",abstract grand fir abies grandis useful model system studying biochemistry molecular genetics regulation defensive oleoresin formation conifer process involving constitutive accumulation resin pitch specialized secretory structure induced biosynthesis monoterpenes sesquiterpenes turpentine diterpene resin acid rosin nonspecialized cell site injury a similarity based cloning strategy employing primer designed conserved region existing monoterpene synthases anticipated amplify bp fragment unexpectedly yielded bp fragment sequence reminiscent terpenoid synthase utilization amplicon hybridization probe afforded four new full length cdna specie wounded fir stem cdna library appeared encode four distinct monoterpene synthases expression escherichia coli followed enzyme assay geranyl diphosphate c farnesyl diphosphate c geranylgeranyl diphosphate c analysis terpene product chiral phase gas chromatography mass spectrometry confirmed sequence encoded four new monoterpene synthases including camphene synthase phellandrene synthase terpinolene synthase enzyme produce limonene pinene the deduced amino acid sequence indicated enzyme residue length kda translated preproteins bearing amino terminal plastid targeting sequence residue cdna truncation delete transit peptide allowed functional expression pseudomature form enzyme exhibited change product outcome result truncation sequence comparison revealed new monoterpene synthases grand fir member tpsd gene subfamily resemble sesquiterpene c synthases diterpene c synthases conifer closely mechanistically related monoterpene synthases angiosperm specie the availability nearly complete set constitutive inducible monoterpene synthases grand fir numbering seven allow molecular dissection resin based defense response conifer specie detailed study structure function relationship among large diverse family catalyst exploit stereochemistry coupled isomerization cyclization reaction,low
99,"cDNA cloning, prokaryotic expression and functional analysis of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in Pogostemon cablin","Abstract

Pogostemon cablin is an important commercial source of patchouli oil, whose main active ingredient is patchouli alcohol. This sesquiterpene is a product of the mevalonate pathway, in which 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) is the rate-limiting enzyme. In this study, P. cablin HMGCR cDNA, comprising 2209 nucleotides encoding 425 amino acid residues was isolated, and bioinformatics analysis was used to analyze the protein sequence. Based on this analysis, a C-terminal truncated variant was engineered for recombinant expression in E. coli. The 38?kDa recombinant protein was identified by SDS-PAGE, and assayed for mevalonolactone production. According to the PcHMGCR1 gene sequence alignment with other species, the HMGCR protein had obvious resemblance with other plants HMG coenzyme A reductase and had homology with other species including plants, fungi, archaebacteria and animals. The prokaryotic expression vector was constructed by restriction enzyme digestion to be transformed into E. coli to express the recombinant protein, and 38?kDa recombinant protein was identified by the SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic activity was detected using GC-MS and, as a result, mevalonolactone was detected in the in vitro reaction mixture.

100,Chapter 1 Aroma Volatiles,"Abstract

Flavor composition has been defined as a complex attribute of quality, in which the mix of sugars, acids, and volatiles play a primary role. In addition to the four basic flavors (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) that humans can recognize in fruits and vegetables, aroma has an important influence on the final consumer acceptance of the commodity. Fruit aroma is determined by a complex mixture of a large number of volatile compounds including alcohols, aldehydes, and esters. During fruit development, especially at ripening, there are many changes of these metabolites caused by their synthesis, transport or degradation. In terms of volatile biosynthesis, several studies have been performed identifying and characterizing the most important genes and encoded enzymes involved in aroma-related volatiles; however, research in the mechanisms of regulation or modulation is still limited. To have an updated overview about aroma biosynthesis in fruit species, the main objective of this manuscript was to review the recent advances in this topic, mainly in terms of the new insights in volatile characterization, gene identification, and regulation of aroma during fruit ripening.",abstract flavor composition defined complex attribute quality mix sugar acid volatile play primary role in addition four basic flavor sweet sour salty bitter human recognize fruit vegetable aroma important influence final consumer acceptance commodity fruit aroma determined complex mixture large number volatile compound including alcohol aldehyde ester during fruit development especially ripening many change metabolite caused synthesis transport degradation in term volatile biosynthesis several study performed identifying characterizing important gene encoded enzyme involved aroma related volatile however research mechanism regulation modulation still limited to updated overview aroma biosynthesis fruit specie main objective manuscript review recent advance topic mainly term new insight volatile characterization gene identification regulation aroma fruit ripening,low
101,Chapter 14 Plant Volatiles in Defence,"Abstract

Plant odours are the most ubiquitous volatiles in nature. This chapter deals with the biochemistry and molecular biology of plant volatiles that are emitted from vegetative tissues during pathogen- or herbivore-induced stress and the contribution of these volatiles to plant defences. While mechanical tissue wounding causes the non-specific release of volatiles, herbivore-specific elicitors from their saliva distinctly alter the volatile signature. These volatiles acquired diverse roles in ecological interactions. Firstly, they can be toxic to, or repel conspecific or other herbivores from already infested plants. This function is referred to as ‘direct defence’. Secondly, volatiles function as prey-associated signals for foraging carnivorous arthropods. This is referred to as ‘indirect defence’. Finally, volatiles elicit metabolic changes in unattacked neighbouring plants resulting in priming and induction of defences already before herbivores have arrived. This is referred to as ‘plant–plant communication’. Although volatile production by native plants and crops is highly variable under different growth conditions and during development, its function in direct and indirect defences is remarkably robust. With the current state of knowledge, it is now possible to manipulate these direct and indirect defences through breeding or transgenic approaches. Taken together, plant volatiles play profound roles in plant–herbivore and plant–pathogen interactions and are promising targets for improved crop protection.",abstract plant odour ubiquitous volatile nature this chapter deal biochemistry molecular biology plant volatile emitted vegetative tissue pathogen herbivore induced stress contribution volatile plant defence while mechanical tissue wounding cause non specific release volatile herbivore specific elicitors saliva distinctly alter volatile signature these volatile acquired diverse role ecological interaction firstly toxic repel conspecific herbivore already infested plant this function referred direct defence secondly volatile function prey associated signal foraging carnivorous arthropod this referred indirect defence finally volatile elicit metabolic change unattacked neighbouring plant resulting priming induction defence already herbivore arrived this referred plant plant communication although volatile production native plant crop highly variable different growth condition development function direct indirect defence remarkably robust with current state knowledge possible manipulate direct indirect defence breeding transgenic approach taken together plant volatile play profound role plant herbivore plant pathogen interaction promising target improved crop protection,medium
102,"Chapter one Arabidopsis thaliana, a model system for investigating volatile terpene biosynthesis, regulation, and function","Summary

Plants use volatile compounds in general, and terpenes in particular, to attract pollinators to their flowers and to ward off, directly or indirectly, harmful insect, animal, and microbial pests. We have shown that the Arabidopsis model system is as useful for the study of terpene biosynthesis and emission as it is for so many other areas of plant biology. The availability of the sequence of the entire Arabidopsis genome has allowed us to identify the complete TPS gene family, and to begin to correlate the emission of specific terpenes with the expression of specific AtTPS genes. With the modern tools available for experimentation in Arabidopsis, this model organism constitutes the best system to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the processes of plant-insect interaction via volatiles, which operate in both the vegetative and the reproductive parts of the plants.",summary plants use volatile compound general terpene particular attract pollinator flower ward directly indirectly harmful insect animal microbial pest we shown arabidopsis model system useful study terpene biosynthesis emission many area plant biology the availability sequence entire arabidopsis genome allowed u identify complete tps gene family begin correlate emission specific terpene expression specific attps gene with modern tool available experimentation arabidopsis model organism constitutes best system elucidate mechanism regulating process plant insect interaction via volatile operate vegetative reproductive part plant,low
103,Chapter ten The chemical wizardry of isoprenoid metabolism in plants,"Publisher Summary

This chapter provides general appreciation for some of the exciting research at several different levels in the field of terpene and isoprenoid metabolism in plants. The structural variety of terpenes is elaborated by subsequent modifications to the cyclic scaffolds or backbones by hydroxylations, methylations, demethylations, halogenations, oxidations, and possibly even glycosylations. Biologists use the tools of molecular genetics to define the contribution of isoprenoids to the ability of plants to interact with their environment. The chapter discusses that molecular biologists and geneticists are determining mechanisms regulating the expression of this biosynthetic machinery, and biochemists are elucidating structure–function relationships for key enzymes in the pathway. Bringing this array of information back together and using it for the creation of novel terpenes having unique biological roles is clearly one of the next great challenges in the field. This includes the development of designer enzymes, the coupling of enzymes in novel ways (physically and biochemically), and expressing de novo isoprenoid pathways in transgenic microbes and plants.",publisher summary this chapter provides general appreciation exciting research several different level field terpene isoprenoid metabolism plant the structural variety terpene elaborated subsequent modification cyclic scaffold backbone hydroxylations methylations demethylations halogenations oxidation possibly even glycosylations biologists use tool molecular genetics define contribution isoprenoids ability plant interact environment the chapter discus molecular biologist geneticist determining mechanism regulating expression biosynthetic machinery biochemist elucidating structure function relationship key enzyme pathway bringing array information back together using creation novel terpene unique biological role clearly one next great challenge field this includes development designer enzyme coupling enzyme novel way physically biochemically expressing de novo isoprenoid pathway transgenic microbe plant,low

Studies aiming to improve cup quality are important to the coffee agrobusiness. Isoprenoids and diterpenes are biochemical compounds related to plant defense mechanisms, health-related properties, and sensorial properties of coffee. Two diterpenes are exclusively found in coffee plants: cafestol (CAF) and kahweol (KAH). The final steps of CAF and KAH biosynthesis have not yet been elucidated. To understand these metabolic pathways and the accumulation/degradation of these compounds, we are integrating biochemical (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and molecular data (RNA sequencing) to find candidate genes that follow the same patterns in both analysis. We identified 24 putative genes, some of which showed an expression pattern similar to HPLC (CAF/KAH) quantification profiles. These data can provide important information on key genes related to the metabolic pathways of isoprenoids and diterpenes and direct future analysis.",abstract studies aiming improve cup quality important coffee agrobusiness isoprenoids diterpenes biochemical compound related plant defense mechanism health related property sensorial property coffee two diterpenes exclusively found coffee plant cafestol caf kahweol kah the final step caf kah biosynthesis yet elucidated to understand metabolic pathway accumulation degradation compound integrating biochemical high performance liquid chromatography hplc molecular data rna sequencing find candidate gene follow pattern analysis we identified putative gene showed expression pattern similar hplc caf kah quantification profile these data provide important information key gene related metabolic pathway isoprenoids diterpenes direct future analysis,high
105,Characterization of three linalool synthase genes from Citrus unshiu Marc. and analysis of linalool-mediated resistance against Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri and Penicilium italicum in citrus leaves and fruits,"Abstract

Three cDNA clones from Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.) were isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli. CuSTS3-1 and CuSTS3-2 encode linalool synthases and CuSTS4 encodes a nerolidol/linalool synthase. Transcripts of CuSTS3-1, CuSTS3-2 and CuSTS4 were abundant in young fruit at 60 days after flowering (DAF), flowers and leaves, respectively. Treatments with Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (XCC), the causal agent of citrus canker and Penicillium italicum (PI), the cause of post-harvest fruit decay, and wounding up-regulated CuSTS3-1 in fruit and mainly CuSTS4 in leaves. Linalool, citral, geraniol and citronellol showed strong antibacterial and antifungal activities against XCC and PI in vitro, while most other mono-and sesquiterpenes, including limonene and gamma-terpinene, did not. Linalool, used at levels similar to those present in resistant Ponkan mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) leaves, was able to inhibit growth of XCC in vitro. Compared to other five citrus types, linalool accumulated at extraordinarily high levels in Ponkan mandarin leaves and was released at high amounts from their leaves, while it was hardly detectable in the most susceptible species, indicating that linalool biosynthesis and accumulation might be involved in plant defense against bacterial and fungal pathogens and be associated with field resistance to citrus canker.",abstract three cdna clone satsuma mandarin citrus unshiu marc isolated expressed escherichia coli custs custs encode linalool synthases custs encodes nerolidol linalool synthase transcripts custs custs custs abundant young fruit day flowering daf flower leaf respectively treatments xanthomonas citri subsp citri xcc causal agent citrus canker penicillium italicum pi cause post harvest fruit decay wounding regulated custs fruit mainly custs leaf linalool citral geraniol citronellol showed strong antibacterial antifungal activity xcc pi vitro mono sesquiterpenes including limonene gamma terpinene linalool used level similar present resistant ponkan mandarin citrus reticulata blanco leaf able inhibit growth xcc vitro compared five citrus type linalool accumulated extraordinarily high level ponkan mandarin leaf released high amount leaf hardly detectable susceptible specie indicating linalool biosynthesis accumulation might involved plant defense bacterial fungal pathogen associated field resistance citrus canker,low
106,Chemistry of Essential Oils and Factors Influencing Their Constituents,"Abstract

Medicinal plants are the most popular forms of traditional plants used to maintain health, as well as prevent or treat physical and mental disorders. Chemical compounds of plants are classified into primary metabolites and secondary metabolites. Plants produce a great variety of secondary metabolites related to the mechanisms of adaptation and important in mediating interactions between plants and the biotic environment. Among secondary metabolites, essential oils (EOs) are very important natural products, which have different therapeutic and biological activities. EOs (volatile oils) are complex mixtures of odorous principles stored in special plant cells and glands in different parts of plants, which are obtained by living organisms and isolated by pressing and hydro or steam distillation in some plant families. The constituents of plant EOs fall mainly into two distinct chemical classes: terpenes and phenylpropanoids. Furthermore, terpene compounds can be divided into two main categories: (1) hydrocarbons, mainly the mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes; and (2) their oxygenated compounds, for instance, alcohols, oxides, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, acids, esters, and lactones. Several factors can influence the composition of EOs, including growth conditions, climate, altitude, soil type, agricultural methods and practices, developmental stage, plant part extracted, and harvesting time. The aim of this chapter is to investigate the chemical composition of various EO-bearing plants and the factors that are most influential in affecting the ratios of essential oil molecules made by the plant.",abstract medicinal plant popular form traditional plant used maintain health well prevent treat physical mental disorder chemical compound plant classified primary metabolite secondary metabolite plants produce great variety secondary metabolite related mechanism adaptation important mediating interaction plant biotic environment among secondary metabolite essential oil eos important natural product different therapeutic biological activity eos volatile oil complex mixture odorous principle stored special plant cell gland different part plant obtained living organism isolated pressing hydro steam distillation plant family the constituent plant eos fall mainly two distinct chemical class terpene phenylpropanoids furthermore terpene compound divided two main category hydrocarbon mainly mono sesqui diterpenes oxygenated compound instance alcohol oxide aldehyde ketone phenol acid ester lactones several factor influence composition eos including growth condition climate altitude soil type agricultural method practice developmental stage plant part extracted harvesting time the aim chapter investigate chemical composition various eo bearing plant factor influential affecting ratio essential oil molecule made plant,low

This chapter discusses the chemistry of isoprenoid compounds. The chemical analysis of plant and animal material has shown the occurrence of a large number of compounds with a molecular structure, which can be constructed from isoprene or isopentane units. This structure appears in volatile oils of plants, the essential oils, valued since early history because they carried the Quinta essentia, the fragrance of the plants. The occurrence of this type of compound in oil of turpentine impressed upon them the name “terpenes.” Higher boiling fractions of the oils contained closely related compounds, which received the name of sesquiterpenes, because their formula contained 1.5 times as many carbon atoms as the monoterpenes. The variety in structure of the terpenoids is caused not only by the number of isopentane or isoprene units, but also by the way in which carbon atoms of the units are interlocked.",publisher summary this chapter discus chemistry isoprenoid compound the chemical analysis plant animal material shown occurrence large number compound molecular structure constructed isoprene isopentane unit this structure appears volatile oil plant essential oil valued since early history carried quinta essentia fragrance plant the occurrence type compound oil turpentine impressed upon name terpene higher boiling fraction oil contained closely related compound received name sesquiterpenes formula contained time many carbon atom monoterpenes the variety structure terpenoids caused number isopentane isoprene unit also way carbon atom unit interlocked,low
108,Chemotypes and terpene synthase genes in Thymus genus: State of the art,"Abstract

Aromatic plants belonging to the Lamiaceae have been used in folk medicine as well as flavouring herbs. This family includes numerous species which are rich in essential oils, that have been studied from both the volatiles point of view and using molecular tools. Thymus is one important genus from this family, comprising about 215 species, whose essential oils have been used by the pharmaceutical industry given their biological activities, namely antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. Essential oils are composed of a mixture of monoterpenes, among other constituents. Terpenoids show high structural variability and over 23.000 different metabolites are known. The occurrence of chemotypes in selected thymus species is listed and organized, and the concept of chemotype is addressed. A multiple approach, considering multivariate analysis of essential oil components and their metabolic relationship, is proposed for chemotype determination. Terpene synthase genes are described, with particular emphasis to the monoterpene synthases, its conserved motifs and features. The role of site directed mutagenesis and its contribution for understanding terpene synthases, revealing the role of some amino acids in the protein activity and final product synthesis is also explored. T. caespititius, a thyme species with carvacrol/thymol, a-terpineol chemotypes, among others, was chosen as an example to describe the state of the art on this topic. The high content of the phenolic monoterpenes makes this species interesting to explore as a source of compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Two ?-terpinene synthases were identified in this thyme species, revealing the existence of two isogenes, one isoform directed to the plastids and the other probably cytosolic, indicating the complexity of terpene synthesis. Functional analysis suggests the existence of additional levels of regulation that might involve direct temperature effect, regulating protein activity and thereby affecting the final product. This opens new layers of regulation that will undoubtedly bring complexity to essential oil composition on aromatic plants. In this review, data available both on essential oils characterization and on monoterpene synthase genes for Thymus species is summarized, stressing the importance of integrating molecular and biochemical data on chemotype determination.",abstract aromatic plant belonging lamiaceae used folk medicine well flavouring herb this family includes numerous specie rich essential oil studied volatile point view using molecular tool thymus one important genus family comprising specie whose essential oil used pharmaceutical industry given biological activity namely antibacterial antifungal anticancer activity essential oil composed mixture monoterpenes among constituent terpenoids show high structural variability different metabolite known the occurrence chemotypes selected thymus specie listed organized concept chemotype addressed a multiple approach considering multivariate analysis essential oil component metabolic relationship proposed chemotype determination terpene synthase gene described particular emphasis monoterpene synthases conserved motif feature the role site directed mutagenesis contribution understanding terpene synthases revealing role amino acid protein activity final product synthesis also explored t caespititius thyme specie carvacrol thymol terpineol chemotypes among others chosen example describe state art topic the high content phenolic monoterpenes make specie interesting explore source compound antioxidant antimicrobial property two terpinene synthases identified thyme specie revealing existence two isogenes one isoform directed plastid probably cytosolic indicating complexity terpene synthesis functional analysis suggests existence additional level regulation might involve direct temperature effect regulating protein activity thereby affecting final product this open new layer regulation undoubtedly bring complexity essential oil composition aromatic plant in review data available essential oil characterization monoterpene synthase gene thymus specie summarized stressing importance integrating molecular biochemical data chemotype determination,low
109,Citrus CmTPS1 is associated with formation of sesquiterpene bicyclogermacrene,"Abstract

Citrus are rich in volatile terpenoids related to fruit flavor and defence response. Remarkable differences in Citrus volatiles provide us an ideal plant material to characterize novel genes associated with volatile formation. Bicyclogermacrene, a sesquiterpene, has high free radical scavenging activity and accumulates in finger citron (Citrus medica L. var. Sarcodactylis Hort) that belongs to wild species of Citrus family. In the present study, CmTPS1 comprised of 1668 base pairs was cloned, belonging to TPS-a subfamily. Transiently transform in tobacco leaf cells showed that CmTPS1 protein localized in the cytoplast. Enzyme activity assay showed that recombinant CmTPS1 catalyzed in vitro formation of bicyclogermacrene toward farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrates. Homologous transient over-expression in finger citron indicated that CmTPS1 also contributed to in vivo biosynthesis of bicyclogermacrene. Accumulated concentration of bicyclogermacrene positively correlated with CmTPS1 transcripts in developing fruit, flowers and leaves of finger citron. Melatonin treatment increased bicyclogermacrene contnent and CmTPS1 transcripts levels. Bicyclogermacrene was detected in finger citron fruit, but was under detected limits in mandarin, sweet orange and Citrus hybrids. Similar profile was observed for transcript levels of CmTPS1.

110,Cloning of hmg1 and hmg2 cDNAs encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and their expression and activity in relation to a-farnesene synthesis in apple,"Abstract

In plants, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) catalyses the synthesis of mevalonate from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. It has been reported to be the rate-limiting enzyme in sesquiterpene and triterpene biosynthesis and is encoded by a small gene family. The accumulation of a-farnesene in the skin tissue of apple fruit during storage appears to be predominantly through the classical mevalonate pathway and not through the novel glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate/pyruvate pathway independent of HMGR action. The content of a-farnesene in the skin tissue increased during the first 8 weeks of storage at 0 °C in air, and started declining after 12 weeks. In contrast, HMGR activity in the total membrane and soluble fractions, was the highest at the time of harvest, but decreased during the first 8 weeks in storage and remained stable thereafter. The potent ethylene action inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene inhibited a-farnesene evolution and HMGR activity by 97 and 30 %, respectively. As a first step in studying the molecular mechanism of apple HMGR regulation, we have isolated and cloned a full-length cDNA (hmg1) as well as a fragment (hmg2), using apple skin mRNA and RT-PCR in the presence of degenerate oligonucleotides designed against conserved regions of plant HMGR genes. Genomic Southern analysis using probes designed for the 3’-end of the two cDNA clones confirmed the presence of at least two HMGR genes in apple. The cDNA for hmg1 has an open reading frame of 1?767 nucleotides. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that the cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 589 residues with a relative molecular mass of 62.7 kDa. The hydropathy profile of the putative polypeptide indicated the presence of two highly hydrophobic domains near the amino terminus. Northern blot analysis confirmed that both hmg1 and hmg2 transcripts possessed a size of 2.4 kb. The two genes are differentially expressed during low temperature storage and in response to C2H4, with hmg1 being expressed constitutively and hmg2 being relatively more sensitive to developmental stimuli and ethylene.",abstract in plant hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase hmgr catalysis synthesis mevalonate hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme a it reported rate limiting enzyme sesquiterpene triterpene biosynthesis encoded small gene family the accumulation farnesene skin tissue apple fruit storage appears predominantly classical mevalonate pathway novel glyceraldehyde phosphate pyruvate pathway independent hmgr action the content farnesene skin tissue increased first week storage c air started declining week in contrast hmgr activity total membrane soluble fraction highest time harvest decreased first week storage remained stable thereafter the potent ethylene action inhibitor methylcyclopropene inhibited farnesene evolution hmgr activity respectively as first step studying molecular mechanism apple hmgr regulation isolated cloned full length cdna hmg well fragment hmg using apple skin mrna rt pcr presence degenerate oligonucleotides designed conserved region plant hmgr gene genomic southern analysis using probe designed end two cdna clone confirmed presence least two hmgr gene apple the cdna hmg open reading frame nucleotide analysis nucleotide sequence revealed cdna encodes polypeptide residue relative molecular mass kda the hydropathy profile putative polypeptide indicated presence two highly hydrophobic domain near amino terminus northern blot analysis confirmed hmg hmg transcript possessed size kb the two gene differentially expressed low temperature storage response c h hmg expressed constitutively hmg relatively sensitive developmental stimulus ethylene,low
111,Functional characterization and substrate promiscuity of sesquiterpene synthases from Tripterygium wilfordii,"Abstract

Acyclic terpenes, commonly found in plants, are of high physiological importance and commercial value, and their diversity was controlled by different terpene synthases. During the screen of sesquiterpene synthases from Tripterygium wilfordii, we observed that Ses-TwTPS1-1 and Ses-TwTPS2 promiscuously accepted GPP, FPP, and GGPP to produce corresponding terpene alcohols (linalool/nerolidol/geranyllinalool). The Ses-TwTPS1-2, Ses-TwTPS3, and Ses-TwTPS4 also showed unusual substrate promiscuity by catalyzing GGPP or GPP in addition to FPP as substrate. Furthermore, key residues for the generation of diterpene product, (E, E)-geranyllinalool, were screened depending on mutagenesis studies.

112,Functional characterization of four sesquiterpene synthases from Ricinus communis (Castor bean),"Abstract

Genome sequence analysis of Ricinus communis has indicated the presence of at least 22 putative terpene synthase (TPS) genes, 13 of which appear to encode sesquiterpene synthases (SeTPSs); however, no SeTPS genes have been isolated from this plant to date. cDNAs were recovered for six SeTPS candidates, and these were subjected to characterization in vivo and in vitro. The RcSeTPS candidates were expressed in either Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with engineered sesquiterpene biosynthetic pathways, but only two (RcSeTPS1 and RcSeTPS7) produced detectable levels of product. In order to check whether the engineered microbial hosts were adequately engineered for sesquiterpene production, a selection of SeTPS genes was chosen from other plant species and demonstrated consistently high sesquiterpene titers. Activity could be demonstrated in vitro for two of the RcSeTPS candidates (RcSeTPS5 and RcSeTPS10) that were not observed to be functional in our microbial hosts. RcSeTPS1 produced two products, (-)-a-copaene and (+)-d-cadinene, while RcSeTPS7 produced a single product, (E, E)-a-farnesene. Both RcSeTPS5 and RcSeTPS10 produced multiple sesquiterpenes.",abstract genome sequence analysis ricinus communis indicated presence least putative terpene synthase tps gene appear encode sesquiterpene synthases setpss however setps gene isolated plant date cdnas recovered six setps candidate subjected characterization vivo vitro the rcsetps candidate expressed either escherichia coli saccharomyces cerevisiae strain engineered sesquiterpene biosynthetic pathway two rcsetps rcsetps produced detectable level product in order check whether engineered microbial host adequately engineered sesquiterpene production selection setps gene chosen plant specie demonstrated consistently high sesquiterpene titer activity could demonstrated vitro two rcsetps candidate rcsetps rcsetps observed functional microbial host rcsetps produced two product copaene cadinene rcsetps produced single product e e farnesene both rcsetps rcsetps produced multiple sesquiterpenes,low
113,Fungal metabolites as precursors to renewable transportation fuels,"Abstract

Fungi are known to produce hundreds of different polyketide, terpene, and terpenoid compounds and based on their chemical structures, 33 of these were selected for further assessment to identify compounds with potential for liquid transportation fuels. Eight of the 33 compounds were identified as having potential as gasoline blend components. Based on predicted boiling points and octane numbers, 2-ethyl-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, sabinene, isobutyric acid,1,8-cineole and linalool met the boiling point and octane number requirements used for the assessment, while 2-ethyl-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and isobutyric acid would require some upgrading. Limonene, isoamyl acetate, and 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-hexanone also have gasoline blend potential without upgrading. For diesel fuel, only 3,3,5-trimethyldecane met the boiling point, cetane number, and flashpoint requirements used for the assessment; however, with upgrading, 18 of the 33 compounds evaluated could potentially serve as blend components of diesel fuel. None of the 33 compounds without upgrading met the four ASTM D1655 specifications for Jet A and Jet A-1 fuel, but 3,3,5-trimethyldecane and limonene were very close. With chemical upgrading, 22 of the 33 compounds could have potential as jet fuel blend components. The monoterpene limonene and six sesquiterpenes were identified as fungal-derived compounds that with upgrading potentially could serve as components of high-energy jet, missile, or diesel fuels.

The increasing availability of fungal genomes and transcriptomes enables the identification of important metabolic pathways for hydrocarbon production. The number of fungal-based compounds having potential for use in hydrocarbon fuels and products is increasing as new compound and pathway discoveries are made and advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology enable the production of these compounds. Several challenges remain including increasing carbon flux toward hydrocarbon fuel precursors in primary metabolism, increasing the low titers of hydrocarbons produced, and establishing robust host strains.

114,GC-MS and 13C-NMR studies on the biosynthesis of terpenoid defensive secretions by the larvae of papilionid butterflies (Luehdorfia and Papilio),"Abstract

The biosynthetic pathway of some terpenic hydrocarbons present in the larval osmeterial secretions of Luehdorfia (homogeneous type) and Papilio (heterogeneous type) species was examined by in vivo experiments, using 13C-labelled acetic acid which was topically applied to the everted osmeteria. GC-MS investigation demonstrated that 13C was incorporated into mono- and/or sesquiterpene hydrocarbons with the enrichment factor of approx. 0.5% (L. puziloi), 1.0% (P. protenor) and 2.9% (P. helenus) by treatment with 1,2-13C-enriched acetic acid, thereby substantiating de novo biosynthesis of terpenes from acetate precursors by these larvae.

118,Genome of Diaporthe sp. provides insights into the potential inter-phylum transfer of a fungal sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic pathway,"Abstract

Fungi have highly active secondary metabolic pathways which enable them to produce a wealth of sesquiterpenoids that are bioactive. One example is ?6-protoilludene, the precursor to the cytotoxic illudins, which are pharmaceutically relevant as anticancer therapeutics. To date, this valuable sesquiterpene has only been identified in members of the fungal division Basidiomycota. To explore the untapped potential of fungi belonging to the division Ascomycota in producing ?6-protoilludene, we isolated a fungal endophyte Diaporthe sp. BR109 and show that it produces a diversity of terpenoids including ?6-protoilludene. Using a genome sequencing and mining approach 17 putative novel sesquiterpene synthases were identified in Diaporthe sp. BR109. A phylogenetic approach was used to predict which gene encodes ?6-protoilludene synthase, which was then confirmed experimentally. These analyses reveal that the sesquiterpene synthase and its putative sesquiterpene scaffold modifying cytochrome P450(s) may have been acquired by inter-phylum horizontal gene transfer from Basidiomycota to Ascomycota. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that inter-phylum transfer of these minimal sequiterpenoid secondary metabolic pathways may have occurred in other fungi.

119,"Genome-wide identification, functional and evolutionary analysis of terpene synthases in pineapple","Abstract

Terpene synthases (TPSs) are vital for the biosynthesis of active terpenoids, which have important physiological, ecological and medicinal value. Although terpenoids have been reported in pineapple (Ananas comosus), genome-wide investigations of the TPS genes responsible for pineapple terpenoid synthesis are still lacking. By integrating pineapple genome and proteome data, twenty-one putative terpene synthase genes were found in pineapple and divided into five subfamilies. Tandem duplication is the cause of TPS gene family duplication. Furthermore, functional differentiation between each TPS subfamily may have occurred for several reasons. Sixty-two key amino acid sites were identified as being type-II functionally divergence between TPS-a and TPS-c subfamily. Finally, coevolution analysis indicated that multiple amino acid residues are involved in coevolutionary processes. In addition, the enzyme activity of two TPSs were tested.

Guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) is a perennial shrub of the Asteraceae family native to the arid southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico that produces high-quality, hypoallergenic natural rubber. Guayule processing produces three output streams: high-molecular weight rubber as the primary product, a mixture of resin/low-molecular weight rubber, and a fine, dry woody bagasse. The goal of this review was to evaluate guayule resin as a source of natural resin and secondary metabolites in order to overcome obstacles to commercialization by maximizing the total economic value of extractable fractions, increasing the scale and robustness of extraction methods, while concurrently lowering the operational costs and environmental impacts of separations. Based on the literature and current market prices, the guayule resin applications with the highest economic potential are residential pesticides (with a specific price range of 1.1–6.8 USD/kg), paints and coatings (0.7–6.0 USD/kg), wood preservative coatings (0.8–6.0 USD/kg), amine-epoxy strippable coatings (0.8–2.5 USD/kg), and adhesives (0.125–1.60 USD/kg).

The biologically and commercially important terpenoids are a large and diverse class of natural products that are targets of metabolic engineering. However, in the context of metabolic engineering, the otherwise well-documented spatial subcellular arrangement of metabolic enzyme complexes has been largely overlooked. To boost production of plant sesquiterpenes in yeast, we enhanced flux in the mevalonic acid pathway toward farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) accumulation, and evaluated the possibility of harnessing the mitochondria as an alternative to the cytosol for metabolic engineering. Overall, we achieved 8- and 20-fold improvement in the production of valencene and amorphadiene, respectively, in yeast co-engineered with a truncated and deregulated HMG1, mitochondrion-targeted heterologous FDP synthase and a mitochondrion-targeted sesquiterpene synthase, i.e. valencene or amorphadiene synthase.

122,"Herbivore-induced, indirect plant defences","Abstract

Indirect responses are defensive strategies by which plants attract natural enemies of their herbivores that act as plant defending agents. Such defences can be either constitutively expressed or induced by the combined action of mechanical damage and low- or high-molecular-weight elicitors from the attacking herbivore. Here, we focus on two induced indirect defences, namely the de novo production of volatiles and the secretion of extrafloral nectar, which both mediate interactions with organisms from higher trophic levels (i.e., parasitoids or carnivores). We give an overview on elicitors, early signals, and signal transduction resulting in a complex regulation of indirect defences and discuss effects of cross-talks between the signalling pathways (synergistic and antagonistic effects). In the light of recent findings, we review molecular and genetic aspects of the biosynthesis of herbivore-induced plant volatiles comprising terpenoids, aromatic compounds, and metabolites of fatty acids which act as infochemicals for animals and some of which even induce defence genes in neighbouring plants. Finally, ecological aspects of these two indirect defences such as their variability, specificity, evolution as well as their ecological relevance in nature are discussed.",abstract indirect response defensive strategy plant attract natural enemy herbivore act plant defending agent such defence either constitutively expressed induced combined action mechanical damage low high molecular weight elicitors attacking herbivore here focus two induced indirect defence namely de novo production volatile secretion extrafloral nectar mediate interaction organism higher trophic level e parasitoids carnivore we give overview elicitors early signal signal transduction resulting complex regulation indirect defence discus effect cross talk signalling pathway synergistic antagonistic effect in light recent finding review molecular genetic aspect biosynthesis herbivore induced plant volatile comprising terpenoids aromatic compound metabolite fatty acid act infochemicals animal even induce defence gene neighbouring plant finally ecological aspect two indirect defence variability specificity evolution well ecological relevance nature discussed,low
123,Homologous and heterologous expression of grapevine E-(ß)-caryophyllene synthase (VvGwECar2),"Abstract

E-(ß)-caryophyllene is a sesquiterpene volatile emitted by plants and involved in many ecological interactions within and among trophic levels and it has a kairomonal activity for many insect species. In grapevine it is a key compound for host-plant recognition by the European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana, together with other two sesquiterpenes. In grapevine E-(ß)-caryophyllene synthase is coded by the VvGwECar2 gene, although complete characterization of the corresponding protein has not yet been achieved. Here we performed the characterization of the enzyme after heterologous expression in E. coli, which resulted to produce in vitro also minor amounts of the isomer a-humulene and of germacrene D. The pH optimum was estimated to be 7.8, and the Km and Kcat values for farnesyl pyrophosphate were 31.4 µM and 0.19 s-1 respectively. Then, we overexpressed the gene in the cytoplasm of two plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana and the native host Vitis vinifera. In Arabidopsis the enzyme changed the plant head space release, showing a higher selectivity for E-(ß)-caryophyllene, but also the production of thujopsene instead of germacrene D. Overall plants increased the E-(ß)-caryophyllene emission in the headspace collection by 8-fold compared to Col-0 control plants. In grapevine VvGwECar2 overexpression resulted in higher E-(ß)-caryophyllene emissions, although there was no clear correlation between gene activity and sesquiterpene quantity, suggesting a key role by the plant regulation machinery.",abstract e caryophyllene sesquiterpene volatile emitted plant involved many ecological interaction within among trophic level kairomonal activity many insect specie in grapevine key compound host plant recognition european grapevine moth lobesia botrana together two sesquiterpenes in grapevine e caryophyllene synthase coded vvgwecar gene although complete characterization corresponding protein yet achieved here performed characterization enzyme heterologous expression e coli resulted produce vitro also minor amount isomer humulene germacrene d the ph optimum estimated km kcat value farnesyl pyrophosphate m respectively then overexpressed gene cytoplasm two plant specie arabidopsis thaliana native host vitis vinifera in arabidopsis enzyme changed plant head space release showing higher selectivity e caryophyllene also production thujopsene instead germacrene d overall plant increased e caryophyllene emission headspace collection fold compared col control plant in grapevine vvgwecar overexpression resulted higher e caryophyllene emission although clear correlation gene activity sesquiterpene quantity suggesting key role plant regulation machinery,low
124,Horizontal pathosystem: resistance factors,"Publisher Summary

The nonspecific resistance factors in the horizontal pathosystem are divided into axeny and true resistance. Axeny is the resistance that occurs before a pathogen–plant cell contact, and true resistance is manifested after the pathogen contact with the cellular protoplast. The chapter explains how anatomical–morphological resistance factors are affected by plant habitus, downy leaves, structure and arrangement of stomata, and anatomic features of internal plant tissues. It also explains the regulation of ontogenesis and damage reparation in pathogens. Many plant parasites can penetrate into tissues only through wounds, and the rate of suberization of wound surfaces correlates with plant resistance. It also explains the nutrient value of infected organs and tissues. The chemical factors available to the plants for their own defense against diseases are diverse in chemical composition, conditions of production, and mechanisms of toxicity. This chapter discusses the chemical classification of phytoanticipins, which includes phenols, terpenoids, proteins, and amino acids. Plants possess not only chemically diverse defense compounds but also various strategies of their application. Protein inhibitors of viruses are a special group of vegetal antibiotic substances. The antiviral activity of a particular inhibitor is usually tested by mixing it with the viral suspension, the mix is used for inoculation of the leaves of a supersusceptible host plant, and then the number of infection spots that occurs is counted. Plant treatment with ribosome inhibitory proteins (RIPs) some time after the inoculation will not prevent development of the viral infection.",publisher summary the nonspecific resistance factor horizontal pathosystem divided axeny true resistance axeny resistance occurs pathogen plant cell contact true resistance manifested pathogen contact cellular protoplast the chapter explains anatomical morphological resistance factor affected plant habitus downy leaf structure arrangement stoma anatomic feature internal plant tissue it also explains regulation ontogenesis damage reparation pathogen many plant parasite penetrate tissue wound rate suberization wound surface correlate plant resistance it also explains nutrient value infected organ tissue the chemical factor available plant defense disease diverse chemical composition condition production mechanism toxicity this chapter discus chemical classification phytoanticipins includes phenol terpenoids protein amino acid plants posse chemically diverse defense compound also various strategy application protein inhibitor virus special group vegetal antibiotic substance the antiviral activity particular inhibitor usually tested mixing viral suspension mix used inoculation leaf supersusceptible host plant number infection spot occurs counted plant treatment ribosome inhibitory protein rips time inoculation prevent development viral infection,medium
125,Isoprenoids: an evolutionary pool for photoprotection,"Plants have evolved several mechanisms for getting rid of excess energy in photosynthetic membranes, some of which involve isoprenoid compounds. In all photosynthetic organisms, the carotenoids ß-carotene and zeaxanthin, and tocopherols serve an important photoprotective role, either by dissipating excess excitation energy as heat or by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppressing lipid peroxidation. Isoprene and some monoterpenes, diterpenes and other carotenoids also occur in some plant lineages. Compelling evidence indicates that these non-ubiquitous isoprenoids might be particularly relevant in adapting plants to adverse climatic conditions by serving as additional and/or alternative protection mechanisms.",plants evolved several mechanism getting rid excess energy photosynthetic membrane involve isoprenoid compound in photosynthetic organism carotenoid carotene zeaxanthin tocopherol serve important photoprotective role either dissipating excess excitation energy heat scavenging reactive oxygen specie ros suppressing lipid peroxidation isoprene monoterpenes diterpenes carotenoid also occur plant lineage compelling evidence indicates non ubiquitous isoprenoids might particularly relevant adapting plant adverse climatic condition serving additional alternative protection mechanism,low

127,Impact of elevated temperature and ozone on the emission of volatile organic compounds and gas exchange of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth),"Abstract

Plants emit a considerable proportion of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis back into the atmosphere as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Increasing evidence indicates that these compounds may have an important role in the adaptation of plants to changing climate, and that VOCs significantly influence atmospheric processes, such as formation of ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols. The effects of elevated temperature (ambient air temperature + 0.8–1 °C) and O3 (1.3–1.4× ambient O3), alone and in combination, on VOC emission, expression of genes related to VOC synthesis, and gas exchange were studied in four silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) clones grown in an open-air exposure field over two growing seasons. Photosynthesis and total emissions of mono-, homo- and sesquiterpenes and compounds other than terpenes [green leaf volatiles (GLVs) + methyl salicylate (MeSA)] were significantly increased and stomatal conductance decreased by temperature increase, while O3 reduced total emission of GLVs + MeSA and photosynthesis of birch. VOC emission rate corresponded with photosynthesis rate in the birch clones. Mono- and homoterpenes showed highest emission in August and GLVs + MeSA in July, whereas gas exchange decreased toward the end of the summer. In contrast to VOC emissions, transcription of genes encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) isomerase at the initial stages of terpene synthesis pathway was lower at elevated temperature and higher at elevated O3. In conclusion, rising temperature will substantially increase VOC emissions from silver birch, presumably independently from stomatal conductance and partially as a consequence of increased availability of substrates due to enhanced photosynthesis.",abstract plants emit considerable proportion carbon fixed photosynthesis back atmosphere volatile organic compound vocs increasing evidence indicates compound may important role adaptation plant changing climate vocs significantly influence atmospheric process formation ozone o secondary organic aerosol the effect elevated temperature ambient air temperature c o ambient o alone combination voc emission expression gene related voc synthesis gas exchange studied four silver birch betula pendula roth clone grown open air exposure field two growing season photosynthesis total emission mono homo sesquiterpenes compound terpene green leaf volatile glvs methyl salicylate mesa significantly increased stomatal conductance decreased temperature increase o reduced total emission glvs mesa photosynthesis birch voc emission rate corresponded photosynthesis rate birch clone mono homoterpenes showed highest emission august glvs mesa july whereas gas exchange decreased toward end summer in contrast voc emission transcription gene encoding deoxy xylulose phosphate synthase dxs deoxy xylulose phosphate reductoisomerase dxr isopentenyl diphosphate ipp isomerase initial stage terpene synthesis pathway lower elevated temperature higher elevated o in conclusion rising temperature substantially increase voc emission silver birch presumably independently stomatal conductance partially consequence increased availability substrate due enhanced photosynthesis,low
128,Impact of insect herbivory on plant stress volatile emissions from trees: A synthesis of quantitative measurements and recommendations for future research,"Abstract

Plants, and particularly trees, are the largest source of atmospheric volatile organic compounds globally. Insect herbivory alters plant volatile emission rates and the types of compounds that are emitted. These stress volatiles are a major contribution to total plant volatile emissions during active herbivore feeding, with important implications for atmospheric chemistry processes. However, emission models do not currently have a quantitative description of plant volatile emission rates during and after insect herbivore feeding. This review provides a brief background on plant volatile organic compounds, the urgency of including biotic stress emissions in models, and a summary of plant volatile emission models and steps they have taken to incorporate stress emissions into their framework. The review ends with a synthesis of volatile emissions from trees during insect herbivory. This synthesis highlights key gaps in studied systems and measurement approaches. We provide a summary of recommendations for future work to address these gaps, improve comparability between studies, and generate the data-sets we need to develop a descriptive model of these plant stress volatile emissions.",abstract plants particularly tree largest source atmospheric volatile organic compound globally insect herbivory alters plant volatile emission rate type compound emitted these stress volatile major contribution total plant volatile emission active herbivore feeding important implication atmospheric chemistry process however emission model currently quantitative description plant volatile emission rate insect herbivore feeding this review provides brief background plant volatile organic compound urgency including biotic stress emission model summary plant volatile emission model step taken incorporate stress emission framework the review end synthesis volatile emission tree insect herbivory this synthesis highlight key gap studied system measurement approach we provide summary recommendation future work address gap improve comparability study generate data set need develop descriptive model plant stress volatile emission,low

The effects of induction under osmotic stress in the presence of glycine betaine and sorbitol were investigated. Although background expression for ADS was reduced when using pLysS strains, no significant difference was noted for ADS activity in soluble whole cell lysates after induction with either IPTG or The Inducer™. For GDS, on the other hand, the change between BL21 (DE3) cells and BL21 (DE3) Tuner™, induced with IPTG, leads to a twofold increase in enzyme activity in the soluble fraction while a reduction in activity is observed when using the pLysS strains. The same doubling of activity is observed for GDS when the commonly used BL.21 (DE3) is induced with The Inducer™. Addition of 2.5 mM glycine betaine and 660 mM sorbitol to the bacterial growth media resulted in reduction of growth rate and biomass yield but under these conditions the best overall protein production, for both enzymes, was obtained. Compared to the standard conditions previously used in our laboratory the yield of soluble active protein was increased 7- and 2.5-fold for ADS and GDS, using BL21 (DE3) pLysS Tuner and BL21 (DE3), respectively.",abstract amorpha diene synthase ads artemisia annua germacrene synthase gds zingiber officinale expressed escherichia coli different condition optimize yield active soluble protein the cdnas enzyme inserted pet vector novagen expressed four different bacterial strain bl de bl de tuner bl de plyss bl de plyss tuner using different inducing agent iptg the inducer the effect induction osmotic stress presence glycine betaine sorbitol investigated although background expression ads reduced using plyss strain significant difference noted ads activity soluble whole cell lysates induction either iptg the inducer for gds hand change bl de cell bl de tuner induced iptg lead twofold increase enzyme activity soluble fraction reduction activity observed using plyss strain the doubling activity observed gds commonly used bl de induced the inducer addition mm glycine betaine mm sorbitol bacterial growth medium resulted reduction growth rate biomass yield condition best overall protein production enzyme obtained compared standard condition previously used laboratory yield soluble active protein increased fold ads gds using bl de plyss tuner bl de respectively,low
130,In vitro culture of lavenders (Lavandula spp.) and the production of secondary metabolites,"Abstract

Lavenders (Lavandula spp., Lamiaceae) are aromatic ornamental plants that are used widely in the food, perfume and pharmaceutical industries. The large-scale production of lavenders requires efficient in vitro propagation techniques to avoid the overexploitation of natural populations and to allow the application of biotechnology-based approaches for plant improvement and the production of valuable secondary metabolites. In this review we discuss micropropagation methods that have been developed in several lavender species, mainly based on meristem proliferation and organogenesis. Specific requirements during stages of micropropagation (establishment, shoot multiplication, root induction and acclimatization) and requisites for plant regeneration trough organogenesis, as an important step for the implementation of plant improvement programs, were revised. We also discuss different methods for the in vitro production of valuable secondary metabolites, focusing on the prospects for highly scalable cultures to meet the market demand for lavender-derived products.",abstract lavenders lavandula spp lamiaceae aromatic ornamental plant used widely food perfume pharmaceutical industry the large scale production lavender requires efficient vitro propagation technique avoid overexploitation natural population allow application biotechnology based approach plant improvement production valuable secondary metabolite in review discus micropropagation method developed several lavender specie mainly based meristem proliferation organogenesis specific requirement stage micropropagation establishment shoot multiplication root induction acclimatization requisite plant regeneration trough organogenesis important step implementation plant improvement program revised we also discus different method vitro production valuable secondary metabolite focusing prospect highly scalable culture meet market demand lavender derived product,low
131,Increased sesqui- and triterpene production by co-expression of HMG-CoA reductase and biotin carboxyl carrier protein in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana),"Abstract

Terpenoids are the most diverse natural products with many industrial applications and are all synthesized from simple precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). In plants, IPP is synthesized by two distinct metabolic pathways – cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway for C15 sesquiterpene and C30 triterpene, and plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway for C10 monoterpene and C20 diterpene. A number of studies have altered the metabolic gene expressions in either the MVA or MEP pathway to increase terpene production; however, it remains unknown if the alteration of the acetyl-CoA pool in plastid fatty acid biosynthesis can influence terpenoid flux. Here, we focused on the fact that acetyl-CoA is the precursor for both fatty acid biosynthesis in plastid and terpene biosynthesis in cytosol, and the metabolic impact of increased plastidic acetyl-CoA level on the cytosolic terpene biosynthesis was investigated. In tobacco leaf infiltration studies, the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex (the enzyme supplying malonyl-CoA in plastid) was partially inhibited by overexpressing the inactive form of biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) by a negative dominant effect. Overexpression of BCCP showed 1.4–2.4-fold increase of sesquiterpenes in cytosol; however, surprisingly overexpression of BCCP linked to truncated HMG-CoA reductase (tHMGR) by a cleavable peptide 2A showed 20–40-fold increases of C15 sesquiterpenes (a-bisabolol, amorphadiene, and valerenadiene) and a 6-fold increase of C30 ß-amyrin. a-Bisabolol and ß-amyrin production reached 28.8?mg?g-1 and 9.8?mg?g-1 dry weight, respectively. Detailed analyses showed that a large increase in flux was achieved by the additive effect of BCCP- and tHMGR-overexpression, and an enhanced tHMGR activity by 2A peptide tag. Kinetic analyses showed that tHMGR-2A has a three-fold higher kcat value than tHMGR. The tHMGR-2A-BCCP1 co-expression strategy in this work provides a new insight into metabolic cross-talks and can be a generally applicable approach to over-produce sesqui- and tri-terpene in plants.",abstract terpenoids diverse natural product many industrial application synthesized simple precursor isopentenyl diphosphate ipp isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate dmapp in plant ipp synthesized two distinct metabolic pathway cytosolic mevalonate mva pathway c sesquiterpene c triterpene plastidic methylerythritol phosphate mep pathway c monoterpene c diterpene a number study altered metabolic gene expression either mva mep pathway increase terpene production however remains unknown alteration acetyl coa pool plastid fatty acid biosynthesis influence terpenoid flux here focused fact acetyl coa precursor fatty acid biosynthesis plastid terpene biosynthesis cytosol metabolic impact increased plastidic acetyl coa level cytosolic terpene biosynthesis investigated in tobacco leaf infiltration study acetyl coa carboxylase complex enzyme supplying malonyl coa plastid partially inhibited overexpressing inactive form biotin carboxyl carrier protein bccp negative dominant effect overexpression bccp showed fold increase sesquiterpenes cytosol however surprisingly overexpression bccp linked truncated hmg coa reductase thmgr cleavable peptide a showed fold increase c sesquiterpenes bisabolol amorphadiene valerenadiene fold increase c amyrin bisabolol amyrin production reached mg g mg g dry weight respectively detailed analysis showed large increase flux achieved additive effect bccp thmgr overexpression enhanced thmgr activity a peptide tag kinetic analysis showed thmgr a three fold higher kcat value thmgr the thmgr a bccp co expression strategy work provides new insight metabolic cross talk generally applicable approach produce sesqui tri terpene plant,high
132,Influence of physiological and environmental factors on the diurnal variation in emissions of biogenic volatile compounds from Pinus tabuliformis,"Abstract

Biological volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) have a large influence on atmospheric environmental quality, climate change and the carbon cycle. This study assesses the composition and diurnal variation in emission rates of BVOCs from Pinus tabuliformis, using an enclosure technique. Environmental parameters (temperature and light intensity) and physiological parameters (net photosynthetic rate, Pn; stomatal conductance, gs; intercellular CO2 concentration, Ci; and transpiration rate, Tr) that may affect emission behavior were continuously monitored. The 10 most abundant compound groups emitted by P. tabuliformis were classified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The dominant monoterpenoid compounds emitted were a-pinene, ß-myrcene, a-farnesene and limonene. The diurnal emission rate of BVOCs changed with temperature and light intensity, with dynamic analysis of BVOCs emissions revealing that their emission rates were more affected by temperature than light. The variation in monoterpene emission rates was consistent with estimates of Pn, gs and Tr. Basal emission rates (at 30?°C,) of the main BVOCs ranged from 0.006 to 0.273?µg??-1/(hr g), while the basal ER standardization coefficients ranged from 0.049 to 0.144?°C-1. Overall, these results provide a detailed reference for the effective selection and configuration of tree species to effectively prevent and control atmospheric pollution.",abstract biological volatile organic compound bvocs large influence atmospheric environmental quality climate change carbon cycle this study ass composition diurnal variation emission rate bvocs pinus tabuliformis using enclosure technique environmental parameter temperature light intensity physiological parameter net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance g intercellular co concentration ci transpiration rate tr may affect emission behavior continuously monitored the abundant compound group emitted p tabuliformis classified gas chromatography mass spectrometry the dominant monoterpenoid compound emitted pinene myrcene farnesene limonene the diurnal emission rate bvocs changed temperature light intensity dynamic analysis bvocs emission revealing emission rate affected temperature light the variation monoterpene emission rate consistent estimate pn g tr basal emission rate c main bvocs ranged g hr g basal er standardization coefficient ranged c overall result provide detailed reference effective selection configuration tree specie effectively prevent control atmospheric pollution,low

Nerolidol is a sesquiterpene present in the essential oils of many plants, approved by the U.S. FDA as a food flavoring agent. Nerolidol interferes with the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in the apicoplast of P. falciparum. In the present study, the in vitro growth of four Babesia species was significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited in the presence of nerolidol (IC50s values = 21 ± 1, 29.6 ± 3, 26.9 ± 2, and 23.1 ± 1 µM for B. bovis, B. bigemina, B. ovata, and B. caballi, respectively). Parasites from treated cultures failed to grow in the subsequent viability test at a concentration of 50 µM. Nerolidol significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited the growth of B. microti at the dosage of 10 and 100 mg/kg BW, while the inhibition was low compared with the high doses used. Therefore, nerolidol could not be used as a chemotherapeutic drug for babesiosis.",abstract nerolidol sesquiterpene present essential oil many plant approved u s fda food flavoring agent nerolidol interferes isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway apicoplast p falciparum in present study vitro growth four babesia specie significantly p inhibited presence nerolidol ic value m b bovis b bigemina b ovata b caballi respectively parasites treated culture failed grow subsequent viability test concentration m nerolidol significantly p inhibited growth b microti dosage mg kg bw inhibition low compared high dos used therefore nerolidol could used chemotherapeutic drug babesiosis,low
134,Integrated metabolome and transcriptome analysis reveals candidate genes involved in metabolism of terpenoids and phthalides in celery seeds,"Abstract

Celery (Apium graveolens L.) seeds have a unique aroma and can be used in the pharmaceutical industry. Terpenoids are the main volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of celery seed essential oil, and phthalides are the source of its aroma. However, thus far, no studies have been conducted on the metabolism of terpenoids and phthalides in celery. In this study, 195 VOCs were detected in celery seeds by using headspace injection combined with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The content of 85 VOCs, including 20 terpenoids and 6 phthalides, was found to be significantly different during the five stages of celery seed development. Based on the pattern of changes in the concentrations of terpenoids and phthalides, an integrated transcriptome and metabolome analysis of three developmental celery seed stages was performed. The results showed that 11 differentially expressed structural genes involved in the metabolism of terpenoids have a positive correlation coefficient with 16 terpenoids, while 103 differentially expressed transcription factor genes are correlated with these 11 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among these differentially expressed transcription factor genes, two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes are similar with Arabidopsis thaliana bHLH gene (MYC2), which has already known to be involved in the regulation of terpenoid metabolism. The results of the integrated analysis also revealed that 88 differentially expressed transcription factor genes are related to 6 phthalides, and one myeloblastosis (MYB) gene is similar with petunia MYB gene (ODORANT1), which is involved in the regulation of the metabolism of volatile benzene compounds in petunia (Pharbitis nil) flowers. Therefore, this study has laid a foundation for further research related to the identification of key genes that regulate the metabolism of terpenoids and phthalides in celery. Moreover, these results can contribute significantly to the improvement in the quality of celery seed essential oil.",abstract celery apium graveolens l seed unique aroma used pharmaceutical industry terpenoids main volatile organic compound vocs celery seed essential oil phthalides source aroma however thus far study conducted metabolism terpenoids phthalides celery in study vocs detected celery seed using headspace injection combined gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the content vocs including terpenoids phthalides found significantly different five stage celery seed development based pattern change concentration terpenoids phthalides integrated transcriptome metabolome analysis three developmental celery seed stage performed the result showed differentially expressed structural gene involved metabolism terpenoids positive correlation coefficient terpenoids differentially expressed transcription factor gene correlated differentially expressed gene degs among differentially expressed transcription factor gene two basic helix loop helix bhlh gene similar arabidopsis thaliana bhlh gene myc already known involved regulation terpenoid metabolism the result integrated analysis also revealed differentially expressed transcription factor gene related phthalides one myeloblastosis myb gene similar petunia myb gene odorant involved regulation metabolism volatile benzene compound petunia pharbitis nil flower therefore study laid foundation research related identification key gene regulate metabolism terpenoids phthalides celery moreover result contribute significantly improvement quality celery seed essential oil,low
135,Medicago truncatula (E)-ß-ocimene synthase is induced by insect herbivory with corresponding increases in emission of volatile ocimene,"Abstract

Virtually all plants are able to recognize attack by herbivorous insects and release volatile organic compounds (VOC) in response. Terpenes are the most abundant and varied class of insect-induced VOC from plants. Four genes encoding putative terpene synthases (MtTps1, MtTps2, MtTps3 and MtTps4) were shown to accumulate in Medicago truncatula Gaertn. in response to Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) feeding and methyl jasmonate treatment in a previous study [S.K. Gomez, M.M. Cox, J.C. Bede, K.K. Inoue, H.T. Alborn, J.H. Tumlinson, K.L. Korth, Lepidopteran herbivory and oral factors induce transcripts encoding novel terpene synthases in Medicago truncatula, Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 58 (2005) 114–127.] The focus of the current study is the functional characterization of one (MtTps4) of these four genes. Using an M. truncatula cDNA clone, the insect-inducible putative terpene synthase was expressed in Escherichiacoli and shown to convert geranyl diphosphate (GPP) into the monoterpene (E)-ß-ocimene as the major product. The clone was therefore designated M. truncatula (E)-ß-ocimene synthase (MtEBOS). Transcripts encoding this enzyme accumulate in M. truncatula leaves in response to exogenous jasmonic acid treatments, lepidopteran herbivory, and lepidopteran oral secretions. Treatment with the ethylene precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) did not cause an increase in MtEBOS transcripts. The volatile (E)-ß-ocimene was released from leaves of both undamaged and insect-damaged plants, but at levels two-fold higher in insect-damaged M. truncatula. Although leaves have low constitutive levels of MtEBOS transcripts, RNA blot analysis indicates no constitutive expression in flowers, stems or roots. The strong insect-induced expression of this gene, and its correspondence with release of volatile ocimene, suggest that it plays an active role in indirect insect defenses in M. truncatula.",abstract virtually plant able recognize attack herbivorous insect release volatile organic compound voc response terpenes abundant varied class insect induced voc plant four gene encoding putative terpene synthases mttps mttps mttps mttps shown accumulate medicago truncatula gaertn response spodoptera exigua h bner feeding methyl jasmonate treatment previous study s k gomez m m cox j c bede k k inoue h t alborn j h tumlinson k l korth lepidopteran herbivory oral factor induce transcript encoding novel terpene synthases medicago truncatula arch insect biochem physiol the focus current study functional characterization one mttps four gene using m truncatula cdna clone insect inducible putative terpene synthase expressed escherichiacoli shown convert geranyl diphosphate gpp monoterpene e ocimene major product the clone therefore designated m truncatula e ocimene synthase mtebos transcripts encoding enzyme accumulate m truncatula leaf response exogenous jasmonic acid treatment lepidopteran herbivory lepidopteran oral secretion treatment ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid acc cause increase mtebos transcript the volatile e ocimene released leaf undamaged insect damaged plant level two fold higher insect damaged m truncatula although leaf low constitutive level mtebos transcript rna blot analysis indicates constitutive expression flower stem root the strong insect induced expression gene correspondence release volatile ocimene suggest play active role indirect insect defense m truncatula,low

137,Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for production of valerenadiene,"Abstract

Valeriana officinalis is a medicinal herb which produces a suite of compounds in its root tissue useful for treatment of anxiety and insomnia. The sesquiterpene components of the root extract, valerenic acid and valerena-1,10-diene, are thought to contribute to most of the observed anxiolytic of Valerian root preparations. However, valerenic acid and its biosynthetic intermediates are only produced in low quantities in the roots of V. officinalis. Thus, in this report, Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered to produce substantial quantities of valerena-1,10-diene in shake flask fermentations with decane overlay. Expression of the wildtype valerenadiene synthase gene (pZE-wvds) resulted in production of 12 µg/mL in LB cultures using endogenous FPP metabolism. Expression of a codon-optimized version of the valerenadiene synthase gene (pZE-cvds) resulted in 3-fold higher titers of valerenadiene (32 µg/mL). Co-expression of pZE-cvds with an engineered methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway improved valerenadiene titers 65-fold to 2.09 mg/L valerenadiene. Optimization of the fermentation medium to include glycerol supplementation enhanced yields by another 5.5-fold (11.0 mg/L valerenadiene). The highest production of valerenadiene resulted from engineering the codon-optimized valerenadiene synthase gene under strong Ptrc and PT7 promoters and via co-expression of an exogenous mevalonate (MVA) pathway. These efforts resulted in an E. coli production strain that produced 62.0 mg/L valerenadiene (19.4 mg/L/OD600 specific productivity). This E. coli production platform will serve as the foundation for the synthesis of novel valerenic acid analogues potentially useful for the treatment of anxiety disorders.",abstract valeriana officinalis medicinal herb produce suite compound root tissue useful treatment anxiety insomnia the sesquiterpene component root extract valerenic acid valerena diene thought contribute observed anxiolytic valerian root preparation however valerenic acid biosynthetic intermediate produced low quantity root v officinalis thus report escherichia coli metabolically engineered produce substantial quantity valerena diene shake flask fermentation decane overlay expression wildtype valerenadiene synthase gene pze wvds resulted production g ml lb culture using endogenous fpp metabolism expression codon optimized version valerenadiene synthase gene pze cvds resulted fold higher titer valerenadiene g ml co expression pze cvds engineered methyl erythritol phosphate mep pathway improved valerenadiene titer fold mg l valerenadiene optimization fermentation medium include glycerol supplementation enhanced yield another fold mg l valerenadiene the highest production valerenadiene resulted engineering codon optimized valerenadiene synthase gene strong ptrc pt promoter via co expression exogenous mevalonate mva pathway these effort resulted e coli production strain produced mg l valerenadiene mg l od specific productivity this e coli production platform serve foundation synthesis novel valerenic acid analogue potentially useful treatment anxiety disorder,low

Of more than 200,000 plant natural products known to date, many demonstrate important pharmacological activities or are of biotechnological significance. However, isolation from natural sources is usually limited by low abundance and environmental, seasonal as well as regional variation, whereas total chemical synthesis is typically commercially unfeasible considering the complex structures of most plant natural products. With advances in DNA sequencing and recombinant DNA technology many of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for the production of these valuable compounds have been elucidated, offering the opportunity of a functional integration of biosynthetic pathways in suitable microorganisms. This approach offers promise to provide sufficient quantities of the desired plant natural products from inexpensive renewable resources.

141,Metabolic engineering of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for the photoproduction of the sesquiterpene valencene,"Abstract

Cyanobacteria are extremely adaptable, fast-growing, solar-powered cell factories that, like plants, are able to convert carbon dioxide into sugar and oxygen and thereby produce a large number of important compounds. Due to their unique phototrophy-associated physiological properties, i.e. naturally occurring isoprenoid metabolic pathway, they represent a highly promising platform for terpenoid biosynthesis. Here, we implemented a carefully devised engineering strategy to boost the biosynthesis of commercially attractive plant sequiterpenes, in particular valencene. Sesquiterpenes are a diverse group of bioactive metabolites, mainly produced in higher plants, but with often low concentrations and expensive downstream extraction. In this work we successfully demonstrate a multi-component engineering approach towards the photosynthetic production of valencene in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. First, we improved the flux towards valencene by markerless genomic deletions of shc and sqs. Secondly, we downregulated the formation of carotenoids, which are essential for viability of the cell, using CRISPRi on crtE. Finally, we intended to increase the spatial proximity of the two enzymes, ispA and CnVS, involved in valencene formation by creating an operon construct, as well as a fusion protein. Combining the most successful strategies resulted in a valencene production of 19 mg/g DCW in Synechocystis.

It starts with a brief introduction to metabolic engineering. For each of the two molecule classes, it provides information on biosynthetic pathways as well as engineering strategies to enhance their formation in the microbial hosts.

143,Metabolism of terpenes in the response of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) leaf tissues to UV-B radiation,"Abstract

This study investigated the terpene profiles as determined by GC–EIMS analysis of in vitro cultured plants of Vitis vinifera exposed to a “field-like” dose of UV-B (4.75 kJ m-2 d-1) administered at two different fluence rates (low, 16 h at 8.25 µW cm-2, and high 4 h at 33 µW cm-2). Low UV-B treatment increased levels of the membrane-related triterpenes sitosterol, stigmasterol and lupeol, more notable in young leaves, suggesting elicitation of a mechanism for grapevine acclimation. By contrast, accumulation of compounds with antioxidant properties, diterpenes a and ? tocopherol and phytol, the sesquiterpene E-nerolidol and the monoterpenes carene, a-pinene and terpinolene had maximum accumulation under high UV-B, which was accentuated in mature leaves. Also the levels of the sesquiterpenic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) increased under high UV-B, although 24 h post irradiation ABA concentrations decreased. Such increments of antioxidant terpenes along with ABA suggest elicitation of mechanism of defense.

144,Metabolite and target transcript analyses during Crocus sativus stigma development,"Abstract

Saffron, the desiccated stigmas of Crocus sativus, is highly appreciated for its peculiar colour, flavour and aroma. Several studies have been conducted with the spice, but little is known about the evolution of volatile and non-volatile compounds generated during the development of the stigma. In this study, we have followed these compounds, with special attention to those of isoprenoid origin (carotenoids and monoterpenes), which are responsible for the organoleptic properties of saffron. The main compounds that accumulated throughout stigma development in C. sativus were crocetin, its glucoside derivatives and picrocrocin, all of which increased as stigmas reached a fully developed stage. The volatile composition of C. sativus stigmas changed notably as stigmas developed with each developmental stage being characterized by a different volatile combination. In red stigmas, ß-cyclocitral, the 7,8 cleavage product of ß-carotene, was highly produced, suggesting the implication of both ß-carotene and zeaxanthin in crocetin formation. As stigmas matured, hydroxy-ß-ionone and ß-ionone were produced while safranal, the most typical aroma compound of the processed spice, was only detected at low levels. However, a safranal-related compound 2,2,2-trimethyl-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione (4-oxoisophorone) increased rapidly at the anthesis stage and also in senescent stigmas. Monoterpenes were mainly emitted at the time of anthesis and the emission patterns followed the expression patterns of two putative terpene synthases CsTS1 and CsTS2. Fatty acid derivates, which predominated at the earlier developmental stages, were observed at low levels in later stages.",abstract saffron desiccated stigma crocus sativus highly appreciated peculiar colour flavour aroma several study conducted spice little known evolution volatile non volatile compound generated development stigma in study followed compound special attention isoprenoid origin carotenoid monoterpenes responsible organoleptic property saffron the main compound accumulated throughout stigma development c sativus crocetin glucoside derivative picrocrocin increased stigma reached fully developed stage the volatile composition c sativus stigma changed notably stigma developed developmental stage characterized different volatile combination in red stigma cyclocitral cleavage product carotene highly produced suggesting implication carotene zeaxanthin crocetin formation as stigma matured hydroxy ionone ionone produced safranal typical aroma compound processed spice detected low level however safranal related compound trimethyl cyclohexene dione oxoisophorone increased rapidly anthesis stage also senescent stigma monoterpenes mainly emitted time anthesis emission pattern followed expression pattern two putative terpene synthases csts csts fatty acid derivates predominated earlier developmental stage observed low level later stage,low

Several efforts have been done to make it possible to produce FOH from microorganisms including S. cerevisiae and E. coli. With developments of systems biology and synthetic biology, an optimal industrial microorganism can be expected to produce FOH cost-effectively. This review aims to give an update on the various facets of FOH synthesis pathway including the features of involved genes and enzymes, and recent progresses on FOH production.

146,"Mild versus severe stress and BVOCs: thresholds, priming and consequences","Plant-generated volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) play key roles in large-scale atmospheric processes and serve the plants as important defense and signal molecules. The main emphasis in quantitative BVOC studies has been on constitutive emissions of isoprene and specific monoterpene species that are present in only certain emitting plant species. However, environmental and biotic stresses can induce emissions of an array of organic compounds in any plant species, whereas the magnitude of emissions induced by given stress depends on stress tolerance, timing, duration and severity (mild versus strong) of the stress. The main view put forward in this review is that quantitative understanding of stress effects is the key for constructing realistic models of both constitutive and induced BVOC emissions.",plant generated volatile organic compound bvocs play key role large scale atmospheric process serve plant important defense signal molecule the main emphasis quantitative bvoc study constitutive emission isoprene specific monoterpene specie present certain emitting plant specie however environmental biotic stress induce emission array organic compound plant specie whereas magnitude emission induced given stress depends stress tolerance timing duration severity mild versus strong stress the main view put forward review quantitative understanding stress effect key constructing realistic model constitutive induced bvoc emission,low
147,"Molecular cloning and characterization of (+)-epi-a-bisabolol synthase, catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of the natural sweetener, hernandulcin, in Lippia dulcis","Abstract

Hernandulcin, a C15 sesquiterpene ketone, is a natural sweetener isolated from the leaves of Lippia dulcis. It is a promising sugar substitute due to its safety and low caloric potential. However, the biosynthesis of hernandulcin in L. dulcis remains unknown. The first biochemical step of hernandulcin is the synthesis of (+)-epi-a-bisabolol from farnesyl diphosphate, which is presumed to be catalyzed by a unique sesquiterpene synthase in L. dulcis. In order to decipher hernandulcin biosynthesis, deep transcript sequencings (454 and Illumina) were performed, which facilitated the molecular cloning of five new sesquiterpene synthase cDNAs from L. dulcis. In vivo activity evaluation of these cDNAs in yeast identified them as the sesquiterpene synthases for a-copaene/d-cadinene, bicyclogermacrene, ß-caryophyllene, trans-a-bergamotene, and a-bisabolol. The engineered yeast could synthesize a significant amount (~0.3 mg per mL) of a-bisabolol in shake-flask cultivation. This efficient in vivo production was congruent with the competent kinetic properties of recombinant a-bisabolol synthase (Km 4.8 µM and kcat 0.04 s-1). Detailed chemical analyses of the biosynthesized a-bisabolol confirmed its configuration to be (+)-epi-a-bisabolol, the core skeleton of hernandulcin. These results demonstrated that enzymatic, stereoselective synthesis of (+)-epi-a-bisabolol can be achieved, promising the heterologous production of a natural sweetener, hernandulcin.",abstract hernandulcin c sesquiterpene ketone natural sweetener isolated leaf lippia dulcis it promising sugar substitute due safety low caloric potential however biosynthesis hernandulcin l dulcis remains unknown the first biochemical step hernandulcin synthesis epi bisabolol farnesyl diphosphate presumed catalyzed unique sesquiterpene synthase l dulcis in order decipher hernandulcin biosynthesis deep transcript sequencings illumina performed facilitated molecular cloning five new sesquiterpene synthase cdnas l dulcis in vivo activity evaluation cdnas yeast identified sesquiterpene synthases copaene cadinene bicyclogermacrene caryophyllene trans bergamotene bisabolol the engineered yeast could synthesize significant amount mg per ml bisabolol shake flask cultivation this efficient vivo production congruent competent kinetic property recombinant bisabolol synthase km m kcat detailed chemical analysis biosynthesized bisabolol confirmed configuration epi bisabolol core skeleton hernandulcin these result demonstrated enzymatic stereoselective synthesis epi bisabolol achieved promising heterologous production natural sweetener hernandulcin,low
148,Molecular cloning and characterization of drimenol synthase from valerian plant (Valeriana officinalis),"Abstract

Drimenol, a sesquiterpene alcohol, and its derivatives display diverse bio-activities in nature. However, a drimenol synthase gene has yet to be identified. We identified a new sesquiterpene synthase cDNA (VoTPS3) in valerian plant (Valeriana officinalis). Purification and NMR analyses of the VoTPS3-produced terpene, and characterization of the VoTPS3 enzyme confirmed that VoTPS3 synthesizes (-)-drimenol. In feeding assays, possible reaction intermediates, farnesol and drimenyl diphosphate, could not be converted to drimenol, suggesting that the intermediate remains tightly bound to VoTPS3 during catalysis. A mechanistic consideration of (-)-drimenol synthesis suggests that drimenol synthase is likely to use a protonation-initiated cyclization, which is rare for sesquiterpene synthases. VoTPS3 can be used to produce (-)-drimenol, from which useful drimane-type terpenes can be synthesized.",abstract drimenol sesquiterpene alcohol derivative display diverse bio activity nature however drimenol synthase gene yet identified we identified new sesquiterpene synthase cdna votps valerian plant valeriana officinalis purification nmr analysis votps produced terpene characterization votps enzyme confirmed votps synthesizes drimenol in feeding assay possible reaction intermediate farnesol drimenyl diphosphate could converted drimenol suggesting intermediate remains tightly bound votps catalysis a mechanistic consideration drimenol synthesis suggests drimenol synthase likely use protonation initiated cyclization rare sesquiterpene synthases votps used produce drimenol useful drimane type terpene synthesized,medium
149,"Molecular cloning, characterization and expression analysis of LoTPS2 and LoTPS4 involved in floral scent formation in oriental hybrid Lilium variety ‘Siberia’","Lilies are a commercially significant cut flower worldwide due not only to their elegant shape but also to their appealing scent. Among Lilium varieties, Lilium ‘Siberia’ is a cultivar that is prominent and highly favored by consumers due to its snowy white color and strong floral scent. Here, two terpene synthase genes (LoTPS2 and LoTPS4) that are responsible for floral scent production in Lilium ‘Siberia’ were cloned and functionally characterized. Recombinant LoTPS2 specifically catalyzed the formation of (E, E)-a-farnesene from FPP. Recombinant LoTPS4 is a multiproduct enzyme that produces D-limonene and ß-myrcene as major volatile compounds and ß-phellandrene, (+)-4-carene and 3-carene as minor products from GPP. Furthermore, LoTPS4 generates trans-a-bergamotene as a major product and di-epi-a-cedrene, a-cubebene and (E)-ß-farnesene as minor compounds from FPP. Subcellular localization analysis using GFP fusion constructs revealed that LoTPS2 was localized in the cytosol, whereas LoTPS4 was localized in plastids. Real-time PCR analysis showed that LoTPS2 was highly expressed in the petals and sepals of the flower, while LoTPS4 was highly expressed in the filament of the flower. Moreover, mechanical wounding of flowers revealed that LoTPS2 showed a strong response to wounding via a rapid increase in its mRNA transcript level.

150,Review on plant terpenoid emissions worldwide and in China,"Abstract

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), particularly terpenoids, can significantly drive the formation of ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the atmosphere, as well as directly or indirectly affect global climate change. Understanding their emission mechanisms and the current progress in emission measurements and estimations are essential for the accurate determination of emission characteristics, as well as for evaluating their roles in atmospheric chemistry and climate change. This review summarizes the mechanisms of terpenoid synthesis and release, biotic and abiotic factors affecting their emissions, development of emission observation techniques, and emission estimations from hundreds of published papers. We provide a review of the main observations and estimations in China, which contributes a significant proportion to the total global BVOC emissions. The review suggests the need for further research on the comprehensive effects of environmental factors on terpenoid emissions, especially soil moisture and nitrogen content, which should be quantified in emission models to improve the accuracy of estimation. In China, it is necessary to conduct more accurate measurements for local plants in different regions using the dynamic enclosure technique to establish an accurate local emission rate database for dominant tree species. This will help improve the accuracy of both national and global emission inventories.

151,Rhizosphere associated bacteria trigger accumulation of terpenes in leaves of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Malbec that protect cells against reactive oxygen species,"Abstract

It has been proposed that plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) stimulate plant growth and development by inducing the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, like terpenes, which reduce stress incidence. Three bacteria previously isolated from grapevine roots and adjacent soil (Microbacterium imperiale Rz19M10, Kocuria erythromyxa Rt5M10 and Terribacillus saccharophilus Rt17M10) were tested as PGPR. After 30 days since root inoculation of in vitro grown Vitis vinifera cv. Malbec plants, the monoterpenes a-pinene, terpinolene and 4-carene, and the sesquiterpene nerolidol were detected only in bacterized-plant leaves. Also, the concentrations of the diterpenes a and ?-tocopherol, and the sterols sitosterol and lupeol were significantly enhanced compared to controls. The leaf extracts of bacterized plants showed photoprotective properties since they decreased the oxygen consumption (that is photo-oxidation) of the amino acid tryptophan in a sensitized solution, thus indicating an increment of the antioxidant capacity of the tissues. In addition, experiments with a-pinene and nerolidol standards showed the capability to intercept reactive oxygen species in the sensitized solution. Moreover, bacterized plants infected with the pathogen Botrytis cinerea showed a reduction in the lesion diameter compared with non-bacterized plants. The results suggest that M. imperiale, K. erythromyxa and mainly T. saccharophilus are able to induce a systemic response that trigger increases on monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, tocopherols and membrane sterols. These compounds enhance the antioxidant capacity in leaf tissues that may help grapevine to cope with stresses.",abstract it proposed plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr stimulate plant growth development inducing biosynthesis secondary metabolite like terpene reduce stress incidence three bacteria previously isolated grapevine root adjacent soil microbacterium imperiale rz m kocuria erythromyxa rt m terribacillus saccharophilus rt m tested pgpr after day since root inoculation vitro grown vitis vinifera cv malbec plant monoterpenes pinene terpinolene carene sesquiterpene nerolidol detected bacterized plant leaf also concentration diterpenes tocopherol sterol sitosterol lupeol significantly enhanced compared control the leaf extract bacterized plant showed photoprotective property since decreased oxygen consumption photo oxidation amino acid tryptophan sensitized solution thus indicating increment antioxidant capacity tissue in addition experiment pinene nerolidol standard showed capability intercept reactive oxygen specie sensitized solution moreover bacterized plant infected pathogen botrytis cinerea showed reduction lesion diameter compared non bacterized plant the result suggest m imperiale k erythromyxa mainly t saccharophilus able induce systemic response trigger increase monoterpenes sesquiterpenes tocopherol membrane sterol these compound enhance antioxidant capacity leaf tissue may help grapevine cope stress,low

Fleshy fruit experiences profound physiological, biochemical, and structural modifications during ripening to facilitate seed dispersal and to become attractive and nutritious for human consumption. The metabolic networks regulating fruit ripening are very complex, and ethylene appears to be a key factor acting in concert with other environmental signals and endogenous factors. The classical distinction between climacteric and nonclimacteric ripening is now questionable, as different patterns of synthesis and sensitivity to ethylene may operate in the ripening of different fruits. In recent years, much progress has been done in the characterization of the main biochemical pathways implicated in the different ripening-associated processes and in the identification of key genes controlling these events. This chapter highlights current understanding and advances in the regulation of fruit ripening and key metabolic pathways associated with the different ripening-related processes, with emphasis on their impact on fruit quality.",abstract fleshy fruit experience profound physiological biochemical structural modification ripening facilitate seed dispersal become attractive nutritious human consumption the metabolic network regulating fruit ripening complex ethylene appears key factor acting concert environmental signal endogenous factor the classical distinction climacteric nonclimacteric ripening questionable different pattern synthesis sensitivity ethylene may operate ripening different fruit in recent year much progress done characterization main biochemical pathway implicated different ripening associated process identification key gene controlling event this chapter highlight current understanding advance regulation fruit ripening key metabolic pathway associated different ripening related process emphasis impact fruit quality,high
153,RNA-seq based transcriptomic analysis of CPPU treated grape berries and emission of volatile compounds,"Abstract

Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is considered to be one of the most popular and widespread fruit crops in the world. Numerous value added products are prepared from grape fruit and investments are being made to establish new viticulture region (Hoff et al., 2017; Imran et al., 2017). CPPU [forchlorfenuron N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N-phenylurea] is a synthetic cytokine-like plant regulator which promotes grape berry set and development. The influence of CPPU [forchlorfenuron N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N-phenylurea] on berry development of ‘Shine Muscat’ (Vitis labruscana Bailey × V vinifera L.) grapes was evaluated under field conditions. A concentration response was observed over a range of 0, 5, and 10 mg L-1 CPPU that was applied to fruitlets (mean diameter 6 mm) at 2 weeks after full bloom. Gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC–MS) revealed that volatile compounds such as terpenoids and aromatics; especially linalool, geraniol and benzyl alcohols, were greatly reduced in CPPU-treated grapes. In contrast, aliphatics, such as hexanol, were increased in CPPU-treated berries. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were induced by CPPU, especially those related to volatile biosynthesis. A total of 494, 1237, and 1085 DEGs were detected in CPPU0-vs-CPPU5, CPPU0-vs-CPPU10, and CPPU5-vs-CPPU10 treatments, respectively. The results were compared against two databases (Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)) to annotate gene descriptions and assign a pathway to each gene. GO covers three domains: biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. Pathway enrichment annotation demonstrated that highly ranked genes were associated with the fatty acid degradation and biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid metabolism and biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction. Analysis with qRT-PCR of twelve selected transcripts validated the data obtained by RNA-seq. Additionally, we also found that genes such as CCDs (carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase), LOX (lipoxygenase), GGDP reductase (geranylgeranyl diphosphate reductase), PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) and some hormones related genes, were closely involved in the formation of volatiles compounds in CPPU treated berries.

154,Secondary Metabolism for Isoprenoid-based Biofuels,"Abstract

Historically, ethanol has served as an archetypal renewable biofuel. However, its suboptimal fuel properties such as low energy content and high water miscibility have provided a strong motivation to explore alternative biofuels with improved fuel properties and compatibility to the existing fuel infrastructure. Isoprenoids are considered one of the most promising advanced biofuel candidates due to their high energy content, hydrophobicity, and excellent cold weather properties. The biosynthetic pathways for isoprenoid production have been extensively studied and engineered for microbial production of flavors, fragrances, drugs, and more recently for the production of biofuels.

In this chapter, we will discuss naturally existing secondary metabolism pathways that synthesize isoprenoids. This work will focus on enzymes and their chemical reactions in particular. The mevalonate pathway and the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway are the two major metabolic pathways for isoprenoid biosynthesis, and they do not share any enzyme or pathway intermediate up to the production of isopentenyl diphosphate. In Sections 2.2 and 2.3, we will discuss the biochemistry and the engineering approaches of these two pathways. In Section 2.4, we will summarize the efforts to engineer the metabolic pathways for isoprenoid biosynthesis in microbial platforms for isoprenoid-based biofuels. The latest progress toward production of isoprenoid-based biofuels is reported, with highlights on engineering efforts to improve metabolic pathways, production hosts, and fermentation processes.",abstract historically ethanol served archetypal renewable biofuel however suboptimal fuel property low energy content high water miscibility provided strong motivation explore alternative biofuels improved fuel property compatibility existing fuel infrastructure isoprenoids considered one promising advanced biofuel candidate due high energy content hydrophobicity excellent cold weather property the biosynthetic pathway isoprenoid production extensively studied engineered microbial production flavor fragrance drug recently production biofuels in chapter discus naturally existing secondary metabolism pathway synthesize isoprenoids this work focus enzyme chemical reaction particular the mevalonate pathway methylerythritol phosphate pathway two major metabolic pathway isoprenoid biosynthesis share enzyme pathway intermediate production isopentenyl diphosphate in sections discus biochemistry engineering approach two pathway in section summarize effort engineer metabolic pathway isoprenoid biosynthesis microbial platform isoprenoid based biofuels the latest progress toward production isoprenoid based biofuels reported highlight engineering effort improve metabolic pathway production host fermentation process,high
155,Sensitivity of Norway spruce physiology and terpenoid emission dynamics to elevated ozone and elevated temperature under open-field exposure,"Abstract

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from vegetation to the atmosphere contribute to global climate change, but climate change factors also affect VOC emission from vegetation. Soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings were exposed to elevated ozone (1.4 × ambient ozone concentration) and elevated temperature (ambient + 1.3 °C) alone and in combination as well as to ambient ozone and temperature treatments under open-field conditions. VOC emissions (mainly terpenoids), genes involved in early steps of plastidial monoterpene and isoprene synthesis, photosynthetic parameters and growth were measured. In July, when daytime elevated ozone concentrations had been over 40 ppb, ozone doubled the total terpenoid emissions by increasing the emissions of many monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Elevated temperature changed the terpenoid profile by increasing the emissions of oxygenated monoterpenes, but did not influence total emissions. Terpenoid emission profiles also differed between elevated ozone alone and elevated ozone in combination with elevated temperature. In August, when daytime elevated ozone concentrations had been ca. 30 ppb, significant treatment effects were not found. Ozone and temperature reduced the expression of DXS2B (1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase type II), and ozone that of DXR (1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase) in August. Elevated temperature reduced the stem diameter growth, net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, but elevated ozone did not have effects on these parameters. Results suggest that elevated temperature may not modify the ozone responses, or vice versa, in terms of gas exchange, growth or total terpenoid emission rates of young Norway spruces in a near-future climate. However, observed changes in terpenoid emission profiles may be important in the future climate, as reactivity in the troposphere differs between individual terpenoids.",abstract volatile organic compound vocs emitted vegetation atmosphere contribute global climate change climate change factor also affect voc emission vegetation soil grown norway spruce seedling exposed elevated ozone ambient ozone concentration elevated temperature ambient c alone combination well ambient ozone temperature treatment open field condition voc emission mainly terpenoids gene involved early step plastidial monoterpene isoprene synthesis photosynthetic parameter growth measured in july daytime elevated ozone concentration ppb ozone doubled total terpenoid emission increasing emission many monoterpenes sesquiterpenes elevated temperature changed terpenoid profile increasing emission oxygenated monoterpenes influence total emission terpenoid emission profile also differed elevated ozone alone elevated ozone combination elevated temperature in august daytime elevated ozone concentration ca ppb significant treatment effect found ozone temperature reduced expression dxs b deoxy xylulose phosphate synthase type ii ozone dxr deoxy xylulose phosphate reductoisomerase august elevated temperature reduced stem diameter growth net photosynthesis stomatal conductance elevated ozone effect parameter results suggest elevated temperature may modify ozone response vice versa term gas exchange growth total terpenoid emission rate young norway spruce near future climate however observed change terpenoid emission profile may important future climate reactivity troposphere differs individual terpenoids,low

Monoterpenes, the C10 isoprenoids, are a large family of natural products that are best known as constituents of the essential oils and defensive oleoresins of aromatic plants. In addition to ecological roles in pollinator attraction, allelopathy and plant defense, monoterpenes are used extensively in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. The importance of these plant products has prompted the definition of many monoterpene biosynthetic pathways, the cloning of the relevant genes and the development of genetic transformation techniques for agronomically significant monoterpene-producing plants. Metabolic engineering of monoterpene biosynthesis in the model plant peppermint has resulted in yield increase and compositional improvement of the essential oil, and also provided strategies for manipulating flavor and fragrance production, and plant defense.",abstract monoterpenes c isoprenoids large family natural product best known constituent essential oil defensive oleoresin aromatic plant in addition ecological role pollinator attraction allelopathy plant defense monoterpenes used extensively food cosmetic pharmaceutical industry the importance plant product prompted definition many monoterpene biosynthetic pathway cloning relevant gene development genetic transformation technique agronomically significant monoterpene producing plant metabolic engineering monoterpene biosynthesis model plant peppermint resulted yield increase compositional improvement essential oil also provided strategy manipulating flavor fragrance production plant defense,high
158,Structural Analyses of Short-Chain Prenyltransferases Identify an Evolutionarily Conserved GFPPS Clade in Brassicaceae Plants,"Abstract

Terpenoids are the largest and most diverse class of plant-specialized metabolites, which function in diverse physiological processes during plant development. In the biosynthesis of plant terpenoids, short-chain prenyltransferases (SC-PTs), together with terpene synthases (TPSs), play critical roles in determining terpenoid diversity. SC-PTs biosynthesize prenyl pyrophosphates with different chain lengths, and these compounds are the direct precursors of terpenoids. Arabidopsis thaliana possesses a subgroup of SC-PTs whose functions are not clearly known. In this study, we focus on 10 geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase-like [GGPPSL] proteins, which are commonly thought to produce GGPP [C20]. We found that a subset of members of the Arabidopsis GGPPSL gene family have undergone neo-functionalization: GGPPSL6, 7, 9, and 10 mainly have geranylfarnesyl pyrophosphate synthase activity (C25; renamed AtGFPPS1, 2, 3, and 4), and GGPPSL8 produces even longer chain prenyl pyrophosphate (=C30; renamed polyprenyl pyrophosphate synthase 2, AtPPPS2). By solving the crystal structures of AtGFPPS2, AtPPPS2, and AtGGPPS11, we reveal the product chain-length determination mechanism of SC-PTs and interpret it as a “three floors” model. Using this model, we identified a novel GFPPS clade distributed in Brassicaceae plants and found that the GFPPS gene typically occurs in tandem with a gene encoding a TPS, forming a GFPPS–TPS gene cluster.",abstract terpenoids largest diverse class plant specialized metabolite function diverse physiological process plant development in biosynthesis plant terpenoids short chain prenyltransferases sc pts together terpene synthases tpss play critical role determining terpenoid diversity sc pts biosynthesize prenyl pyrophosphate different chain length compound direct precursor terpenoids arabidopsis thaliana posse subgroup sc pts whose function clearly known in study focus geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase like ggppsl protein commonly thought produce ggpp c we found subset member arabidopsis ggppsl gene family undergone neo functionalization ggppsl mainly geranylfarnesyl pyrophosphate synthase activity c renamed atgfpps ggppsl produce even longer chain prenyl pyrophosphate c renamed polyprenyl pyrophosphate synthase atppps by solving crystal structure atgfpps atppps atggpps reveal product chain length determination mechanism sc pts interpret three floor model using model identified novel gfpps clade distributed brassicaceae plant found gfpps gene typically occurs tandem gene encoding tps forming gfpps tps gene cluster,low
159,Structure and synthesis of polyisoprenoids used in N-glycosylation across the three domains of life,"Abstract

N-linked protein glycosylation was originally thought to be specific to eukaryotes, but evidence of this post-translational modification has now been discovered across all domains of life: Eucarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. In all cases, the glycans are first assembled in a step-wise manner on a polyisoprenoid carrier lipid. At some stage of lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthesis, the glycan is flipped across a membrane. Subsequently, the completed glycan is transferred to specific asparagine residues on the protein of interest. Interestingly, though the N-glycosylation pathway seems to be conserved, the biosynthetic pathways of the polyisoprenoid carriers, the specific structures of the carriers, and the glycan residues added to the carriers vary widely. In this review we will elucidate how organisms in each basic domain of life synthesize the polyisoprenoids that they utilize for N-linked glycosylation and briefly discuss the subsequent modifications of the lipid to generate a lipid-linked oligosaccharide.",abstract n linked protein glycosylation originally thought specific eukaryote evidence post translational modification discovered across domain life eucarya bacteria archaea in case glycans first assembled step wise manner polyisoprenoid carrier lipid at stage lipid linked oligosaccharide synthesis glycan flipped across membrane subsequently completed glycan transferred specific asparagine residue protein interest interestingly though n glycosylation pathway seems conserved biosynthetic pathway polyisoprenoid carrier specific structure carrier glycan residue added carrier vary widely in review elucidate organism basic domain life synthesize polyisoprenoids utilize n linked glycosylation briefly discus subsequent modification lipid generate lipid linked oligosaccharide,low
160,Studies on the volatile compounds in flower extracts of Rosa odorata and R. chinensis,"Abstract

Roses are culturally and economically important ornamental plants in the perfume industry. Rosa odorata, the unique rose species in Yunnan region of China, with strong fragrance and abundant varieties, played a prominent role in the formation of modern roses' tea-scent. In the present study, three taxa of Rosa odorata and three taxa of R. chinensis germplasm resources were examined for their chemical profiles of volatile compounds of flower extracts at different flowering stages by sensory analysis and solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC–MS) analysis. A total of 103 volatile organic compounds (VOC) were detected, including 33 major compounds. The release of total VOC was in the following order: OG (R. odorata var. gigantea) > CSR (R. chinensis var. spontanea Red) > CSW (R. chinensis var. Spontanea White) > COB (R. chinensis 'Old Blush') > OE (R. odorata var. erubescens) > OO (R. odorata var. odorata). The production and release of floral VOC in double flowers were delayed by those in single flowers. Principal component analysis showed that some benzodiazepines and sesquiterpenoids were their characteristic substances, which could separate R. odorata and R. chinensis. R. odorata contained more volatile compounds originated from benzodiazepine metabolic pathway, such as 3,5-dimethoxytoluene and phenyl ethanol, which were not found in R. chinensis. In addition, the release of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene in R. chinensis was significantly higher than that in R. odorata.

161,"Systemin and jasmonic acid regulate constitutive and herbivore-induced systemic volatile emissions in tomato, Solanum lycopersicum","Abstract

Transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants that overexpress the Prosystemin gene (35S::PS) and plants with a mutation in the JA biosynthetic pathway (def1) are known to exhibit a constitutive or reduced wound response, respectively. Here it is demonstrated that several independent 35S::PS lines emit high levels of specific volatiles in addition to increased accumulation of proteinase inhibitors (PIs). Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of systemically induced volatile compounds including green-leaf volatiles, terpenes, and shikimic acid-derivatives from 35S::PS and def1 plants in response to herbivore wounding and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) are described. Application of JA induced defense protein accumulation and volatile emissions in wild type plants, but did not further increase systemic volatile emissions from 35S::PS plants.

162,Tailored carbon partitioning for phototrophic production of (E)-a-bisabolene from the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"Abstract

Photosynthetic microbial hosts such as cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae have recently emerged as alternative engineering platforms for the sustainable light-driven bio-production of terpenoids. Many desirable compounds with numerous applications can be produced in microorganisms by heterologous expression of terpene synthases. However, success of green microbial systems has been hampered by issues such as insufficient enzyme expression titers and low flux to desired terpenoid products from carbon fixed during photosynthesis. This work demonstrates how the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can be engineered to produce the sesquiterpene biodiesel precursor (E)-a-bisabolene. Through strategic genetic engineering, substantial enhancements of productivity were achieved by coordinated tuning of the isoprenoid metabolism, combining serial enzyme loading for terpene synthase overexpression and amiRNA-based repression of competing pathways. Up to 10.3 ± 0.7 mg bisabolene·g-1 cell dry weight could be produced in five days, which represents more than a 15-fold increase over single synthase expression strains. Investigation of strain performance in scale-up cultivations determined overall bisabolene productivity benefits from light:dark cycles. Mixotrophic cultivation can yield up to 11.0 ± 0.5 mg bisabolene per liter in seven days in these conditions, and phototrophic production of 3.9 ± 0.2 mg per liter was feasible. These achievements represent an important milestone in the engineering of C. reinhardtii towards the goal of designing sustainable, light-driven, green-cell algal bio-factories.",abstract photosynthetic microbial host cyanobacteria eukaryotic microalgae recently emerged alternative engineering platform sustainable light driven bio production terpenoids many desirable compound numerous application produced microorganism heterologous expression terpene synthases however success green microbial system hampered issue insufficient enzyme expression titer low flux desired terpenoid product carbon fixed photosynthesis this work demonstrates green microalga chlamydomonas reinhardtii engineered produce sesquiterpene biodiesel precursor e bisabolene through strategic genetic engineering substantial enhancement productivity achieved coordinated tuning isoprenoid metabolism combining serial enzyme loading terpene synthase overexpression amirna based repression competing pathway up mg bisabolene g cell dry weight could produced five day represents fold increase single synthase expression strain investigation strain performance scale cultivation determined overall bisabolene productivity benefit light dark cycle mixotrophic cultivation yield mg bisabolene per liter seven day condition phototrophic production mg per liter feasible these achievement represent important milestone engineering c reinhardtii towards goal designing sustainable light driven green cell algal bio factory,low
163,Terpene evolution during the development of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Shiraz grapes,"Abstract

The flavour of wine is derived, in part, from the flavour compounds present in the grape, which change as the grapes accumulate sugar and ripen. Grape berry terpene concentrations may vary at different stages of berry development. This study aimed to investigate terpene evolution in grape berries from four weeks post-flowering to maturity. Grape bunches were sampled at fortnightly intervals over two vintages (2012–13 and 2013–14). In total, five monoterpenoids, 24 sesquiterpenes, and four norisoprenoids were detected in grape samples. The highest concentrations of total monoterpenoids, total sesquiterpenes, and total norisoprenoids in grapes were all observed at pre-veraison. Terpenes derived from the same biosynthetic pathway had a similar production pattern during berry development. Terpenes in grapes at harvest might not necessarily be synthesised at post-veraison, since the compounds or their precursors may already exist in grapes at pre-veraison, with the veraison to harvest period functioning to convert these precursors into final products.",abstract the flavour wine derived part flavour compound present grape change grape accumulate sugar ripen grape berry terpene concentration may vary different stage berry development this study aimed investigate terpene evolution grape berry four week post flowering maturity grape bunch sampled fortnightly interval two vintage in total five monoterpenoids sesquiterpenes four norisoprenoids detected grape sample the highest concentration total monoterpenoids total sesquiterpenes total norisoprenoids grape observed pre veraison terpenes derived biosynthetic pathway similar production pattern berry development terpenes grape harvest might necessarily synthesised post veraison since compound precursor may already exist grape pre veraison veraison harvest period functioning convert precursor final product,low

165,Terpenes in Cannabis sativa – From plant genome to humans,"Abstract

Cannabis sativa (cannabis) produces a resin that is valued for its psychoactive and medicinal properties. Despite being the foundation of a multi-billion dollar global industry, scientific knowledge and research on cannabis is lagging behind compared to other high-value crops. This is largely due to legal restrictions that have prevented many researchers from studying cannabis, its products, and their effects in humans. Cannabis resin contains hundreds of different terpene and cannabinoid metabolites. Many of these metabolites have not been conclusively identified. Our understanding of the genomic and biosynthetic systems of these metabolites in cannabis, and the factors that affect their variability, is rudimentary. As a consequence, there is concern about lack of consistency with regard to the terpene and cannabinoid composition of different cannabis ‘strains’. Likewise, claims of some of the medicinal properties attributed to cannabis metabolites would benefit from thorough scientific validation.",abstract cannabis sativa cannabis produce resin valued psychoactive medicinal property despite foundation multi billion dollar global industry scientific knowledge research cannabis lagging behind compared high value crop this largely due legal restriction prevented many researcher studying cannabis product effect human cannabis resin contains hundred different terpene cannabinoid metabolite many metabolite conclusively identified our understanding genomic biosynthetic system metabolite cannabis factor affect variability rudimentary as consequence concern lack consistency regard terpene cannabinoid composition different cannabis strain likewise claim medicinal property attributed cannabis metabolite would benefit thorough scientific validation,low
166,Terpenoid biosynthesis in Dendrobium officinale: Identification of (E)-ß-caryophyllene synthase and the regulatory MYB genes,"Abstract

Dendrobium officinale Kimura et Migo is a well-known medicinal plant producing terpenoid alkaloids as the main medicinal constituents. D. officinale also produces many volatile terpenoids, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. However, little is known about the biosynthetic and regulatory mechanisms underlying terpenoid biosynthesis in this plant. This study first analyzed the terpenoid profiles of D. officinale PLBs treated with lovastatin (LOV) and fosmidomycin (FOS), two chemical inhibitors of terpenoid pathways, and produced corresponding transcriptomes. The volatile products of PLBs were mainly sesquiterpenes, and the contents of (E)-ß-caryophyllene and a-humulene were decreased by 42.05% and 27.27%, respectively, after LOV treatment. A candidate sesquiterpene synthase gene identified from the transcriptome and terpene metabolic profiling as (E)-ß-caryophyllene synthase (DoECS), localized in the cytoplasm. The emission of (E)-ß-caryophyllene decreased by 26.70% in DoECS RNA interference PLBs compared with the control group. Based on co-expression analysis, four MYB genes (DoMYB26, DoMYB29, DoMYB31 and DoMYB32) were involved in the transcriptional regulation of DoECS. Yeast one-hybrid assays and fluorometric GUS assay provided evidence that DoMYB26 and DoMYB31 positively regulated the expression of DoECS, while DoMYB29 negatively regulated the expression of DoECS.

167,Terpenoids as Emerging Therapeutic Agents: Cellular Targets and Mechanisms of Action against Protozoan Parasites,"Abstract

Terpenoids are the largest and structurally most diverse group of secondary metabolites derived from natural sources. Empirical evidence from several bioassays points to the therapeutic potentials of terpenoids against protozoan parasitic diseases such as malaria, trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis. The versatility of the parent terpenoid backbones allows for structural diversity among the group, which in turn leads to multiple cellular targets and consequently varying mechanisms of antiparasitic action. Available data implicate disruption of parasite cell membrane architecture, interference with mitochondrial respiration, interaction with various crucial proteins of the parasites among other probable mechanisms. Identification of the specific cellular targets vis-á-vis the mechanisms of action of the different terpenoids will aid the design of novel and safer antiparasitic agent(s). This chapter therefore aims to discuss parasites-related cellular targets of terpenoids and their mode of antiparasitic activity. We hope that the chapter will be a valuable source of useful information in the exploration of the full potential of terpenoids as antiparasitic agents.",abstract terpenoids largest structurally diverse group secondary metabolite derived natural source empirical evidence several bioassay point therapeutic potential terpenoids protozoan parasitic disease malaria trypanosomiasis leishmaniasis the versatility parent terpenoid backbone allows structural diversity among group turn lead multiple cellular target consequently varying mechanism antiparasitic action available data implicate disruption parasite cell membrane architecture interference mitochondrial respiration interaction various crucial protein parasite among probable mechanism identification specific cellular target vi vi mechanism action different terpenoids aid design novel safer antiparasitic agent this chapter therefore aim discus parasite related cellular target terpenoids mode antiparasitic activity we hope chapter valuable source useful information exploration full potential terpenoids antiparasitic agent,medium
168,The biochemistry of homoterpenes – Common constituents of floral and herbivore-induced plant volatile bouquets,"Abstract

Volatile organic compounds emitted by plants mediate a variety of interactions between plants and other organisms. The irregular acyclic homoterpenes, 4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) and 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT), are among the most widespread volatiles produced by angiosperms with emissions from flowers and from vegetative tissues upon herbivore feeding. Special attention has been placed on the role of homoterpenes in attracting parasitoids and predators of herbivores and has sparked interest in engineering homoterpene formation to improve biological pest control. The biosynthesis of DMNT and TMTT proceeds in two enzymatic steps: the formation of the tertiary C15-, and C20-alcohols, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-geranyl linalool, respectively, catalyzed by terpene synthases, and the subsequent oxidative degradation of both alcohols by a single cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the herbivore-induced biosynthesis of TMTT is catalyzed by the concerted activities of the (E,E)-geranyllinalool synthase, AtGES, and CYP82G1, a P450 of the so far uncharacterized plant CYP82 family. TMTT formation is in part controlled at the level of AtGES expression. Co-expression of AtGES with CYP82G1 at wound sites allows for an efficient conversion of the alcohol intermediate. The identified homoterpene biosynthesis genes in Arabidopsis and related genes from other plant species provide tools to engineer homoterpene formation and to address questions of the regulation and specific activities of homoterpenes in plant–herbivore interactions.",abstract volatile organic compound emitted plant mediate variety interaction plant organism the irregular acyclic homoterpenes dimethylnona triene dmnt trimethyltrideca tetraene tmtt among widespread volatile produced angiosperm emission flower vegetative tissue upon herbivore feeding special attention placed role homoterpenes attracting parasitoids predator herbivore sparked interest engineering homoterpene formation improve biological pest control the biosynthesis dmnt tmtt proceeds two enzymatic step formation tertiary c c alcohol e nerolidol e e geranyl linalool respectively catalyzed terpene synthases subsequent oxidative degradation alcohol single cytochrome p monooxygenase p in arabidopsis thaliana herbivore induced biosynthesis tmtt catalyzed concerted activity e e geranyllinalool synthase atges cyp g p far uncharacterized plant cyp family tmtt formation part controlled level atges expression co expression atges cyp g wound site allows efficient conversion alcohol intermediate the identified homoterpene biosynthesis gene arabidopsis related gene plant specie provide tool engineer homoterpene formation address question regulation specific activity homoterpenes plant herbivore interaction,low
169,The impact of cold stress on genes expression pattern of mono- and sesquiterpene biosynthesis and their contents in Ocimum basilicum L.,"Abstract

Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) contains valuable monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds used for medical purposes. Environmental stresses are suggested to change the essential oil composition in medicinal plants. In the current investigation, an experiment was arranged in greenhouse to study the effect of cold stress on genes expression patterns of linalool synthase (LIS), ß-myrcene synthase (MYS), ?-cadinene synthase (CDS), germacrene D synthase (GDS) and geraniol synthase (GES) which is involved in monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes biosynthesis in O. basilicum. The monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes composition and content were also investigated. Plants were exposed to temperatures 22 (control), 4 and 10?°C at 6 to 8 leaf stage for 12, 24 and 48?h. The genes expression levels were determined by real time PCR in plant leaves. Essential oil was extracted at flowering stage by distillation using Clevenger apparatus and its compounds were identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results revealed that the LIS expression increasingly occurred to 4.86 fold at 10?°C after 12?h while that of GES reached to 5.7 fold at 10?°C after 48?h. Temperature 4?°C for 12?h increased the expression levels of MYS and GDS genes to 41.5 and 14.2 fold, respectively, while the expression level of CDS increased to 25.5 fold at 4?°C for 48?h. Significant differences (P?=?0.01) were observed among treatments with respect to all compounds except a-pinene and camphene. The maximum proportion of geraniol and ?-cadinene were observed at 4?°C for 24?h, while the maximum proportion of germacrene D and a-bergamotene obtained at 10?°C for 12?h. The highest proportion of 1, 8-cineole was achieved at 4?°C for 48?h. Positive associations between germacrene D content and GDS expression (r?=?0.8, P?=?0.05) and ?-cadinene and CDS expression (r?=?0.78, P?=?0.05) proposed that the content of terpenoid compounds in basil can be enhanced through increasing the expression levels of genes involved in their biosynthesis.",abstract basil ocimum basilicum l contains valuable monoterpene sesquiterpene compound used medical purpose environmental stress suggested change essential oil composition medicinal plant in current investigation experiment arranged greenhouse study effect cold stress gene expression pattern linalool synthase lis myrcene synthase mys cadinene synthase cds germacrene d synthase gds geraniol synthase ges involved monoterpenes sesquiterpenes biosynthesis o basilicum the monoterpenes sesquiterpenes composition content also investigated plants exposed temperature control c leaf stage h the gene expression level determined real time pcr plant leaf essential oil extracted flowering stage distillation using clevenger apparatus compound identified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the result revealed lis expression increasingly occurred fold c h ges reached fold c h temperature c h increased expression level mys gds gene fold respectively expression level cds increased fold c h significant difference p observed among treatment respect compound except pinene camphene the maximum proportion geraniol cadinene observed c h maximum proportion germacrene d bergamotene obtained c h the highest proportion cineole achieved c h positive association germacrene d content gds expression r p cadinene cds expression r p proposed content terpenoid compound basil enhanced increasing expression level gene involved biosynthesis,low
170,The interactions of Trichoderma at multiple trophic levels: inter-kingdom communication,"Abstract

Trichoderma spp. are universal saprotrophic fungi in terrestrial ecosystems, and as rhizosphere inhabitants, they mediate interactions with other soil microorganisms, plants, and arthropods at multiple trophic levels. In the rhizosphere, Trichoderma can reduce the abundance of phytopathogenic microorganisms, which involves the action of potent inhibitory molecules, such as gliovirin and siderophores, whereas endophytic associations between Trichoderma and the seeds and roots of host plants can result in enhanced plant growth and crop productivity, as well as the alleviation of abiotic stress. Such beneficial effects are mediated via the activation of endogenous mechanisms controlled by phytohormones such as auxins and abscisic acid, as well as by alterations in host plant metabolism. During either root colonization or in the absence of physical contact, Trichoderma can trigger early defense responses mediated by Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species, and subsequently stimulate plant immunity by enhancing resistance mechanisms regulated by the phytohormones salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene. In addition, Trichoderma release volatile organic compounds and nitrogen or oxygen heterocyclic compounds that serve as signaling molecules, which have effects on plant growth, phytopathogen levels, herbivorous insects, and at the third trophic level, play roles in attracting the natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) of herbivores.

171,"The Isogene 1-Deoxy-D-Xylulose 5-Phosphate Synthase 2 Controls Isoprenoid Profiles, Precursor Pathway Allocation, and Density of Tomato Trichomes","ABSTRACT

Plant isoprenoids are formed from precursors synthesized by the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol or by the methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids. Although some exchange of precursors occurs, cytosolic sesquiterpenes are assumed to derive mainly from MVA, while plastidial monoterpenes are produced preferentially from MEP precursors. Additional complexity arises in the first step of the MEP pathway, which is typically catalyzed by two divergent 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase isoforms (DXS1, DXS2). In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the SlDXS1 gene is ubiquitously expressed with highest levels during fruit ripening, whereas SlDXS2 transcripts are abundant in only few tissues, including young leaves, petals, and isolated trichomes. Specific down-regulation of SlDXS2 expression was performed by RNA interference in transgenic plants to investigate feedback mechanisms. SlDXS2 down-regulation led to a decrease in the monoterpene ß-phellandrene and an increase in two sesquiterpenes in trichomes. Moreover, incorporation of MVA-derived precursors into residual monoterpenes and into sesquiterpenes was elevated as determined by comparison of 13C to 12C natural isotope ratios. A compensatory up-regulation of SlDXS1 was not observed. Down-regulated lines also exhibited increased trichome density and showed less damage by leaf-feeding Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars.

172,The potential of the mevalonate pathway for enhanced isoprenoid production,"Abstract

The cytosol-localised mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway delivers the basic isoprene unit isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). In higher plants, this central metabolic intermediate is also synthesised by the plastid-localised methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Both MVA and MEP pathways conspire through exchange of intermediates and regulatory interactions. Products downstream of IPP such as phytosterols, carotenoids, vitamin E, artemisinin, tanshinone and paclitaxel demonstrate antioxidant, cholesterol-reducing, anti-ageing, anticancer, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. Other isoprenoid precursors including isoprene, isoprenol, geraniol, farnesene and farnesol are economically valuable. An update on the MVA pathway and its interaction with the MEP pathway is presented, including the improvement in the production of phytosterols and other isoprenoid derivatives. Such attempts are for instance based on the bioengineering of microbes such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as plants.

173,The production of the sesquiterpene ß-caryophyllene in a transgenic strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis,"Abstract

The plant secondary metabolite, ß-caryophyllene, is a ubiquitous component of many plant resins that has traditionally been used in the cosmetics industry to provide a woody, spicy aroma to cosmetics and perfumes. Clinical studies have shown it to be potentially effective as an antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory agent. Additionally, there is significant interest in engineering phototrophic microorganisms with sesquiterpene synthase genes for the production of biofuels. Currently, the isolation of ß-caryophyllene relies on purification methods from oleoresins extracted from large amounts of plant material. An engineered cyanobacterium platform that produces ß-caryophyllene may provide a more sustainable and controllable means of production. To this end, the ß-caryophyllene synthase gene (QHS1) from Artemisia annua was stably inserted, via double homologous recombination, into the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. Gene insertion into Synechocystis was confirmed through PCR assays and sequencing reactions. Transcription and expression of QHS1 were confirmed using RT-PCR, and synthesis of ß-caryophyllene was confirmed in the transgenic strain using GC-FID and GC–MS analysis.",abstract the plant secondary metabolite caryophyllene ubiquitous component many plant resin traditionally used cosmetic industry provide woody spicy aroma cosmetic perfume clinical study shown potentially effective antibiotic anesthetic anti inflammatory agent additionally significant interest engineering phototrophic microorganism sesquiterpene synthase gene production biofuels currently isolation caryophyllene relies purification method oleoresin extracted large amount plant material an engineered cyanobacterium platform produce caryophyllene may provide sustainable controllable mean production to end caryophyllene synthase gene qhs artemisia annua stably inserted via double homologous recombination genome cyanobacterium synechocystis sp strain pcc gene insertion synechocystis confirmed pcr assay sequencing reaction transcription expression qhs confirmed using rt pcr synthesis caryophyllene confirmed transgenic strain using gc fid gc ms analysis,low
174,The rice (E)-ß-caryophyllene synthase (OsTPS3) accounts for the major inducible volatile sesquiterpenes,"Abstract

Terpenoids serve as both constitutive and inducible defense chemicals in many plant species, and volatile terpenes participate in plant a indirect defense by attracting natural enemies of the herbivores. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains about 50 genes encoding putative terpene synthases (TPSs). Here we report that two of the rice sesquiterpene synthase genes, OsTPS3 and OsTPS13, encode (E)-ß-caryophyllene synthase and (E,E)-farnesol synthase, respectively. In vitro, the recombinant protein of OsTPS3 catalyzed formation of (E)-ß-caryophyllene and several other sesquiterpenes, including ß-elemene and a-humulene, all being components of inducible volatiles of rice plants. The transcript levels of OsTPS3 exhibit a circadian rhythm of fluctuation, and its expression was also greatly induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). In addition, expression of OsTPS3 in transgenic plants of Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in emitting high quantities of OsTPS3 products. We also overexpressed OsTPS3 in rice plants which then produced more (E)-ß-caryophyllene after MeJA treatment. Finally, we found that the MeJA-treated transgenic rice plants attracted more parasitoid wasps of Anagrus nilaparvatae than the wild-type. These results demonstrate that OsTPS3, an enzyme catalyzing the formation of volatile sesquiterpenes, plays a role in indirect defense of rice plants.",abstract terpenoids serve constitutive inducible defense chemical many plant specie volatile terpene participate plant indirect defense attracting natural enemy herbivore the rice oryza sativa l genome contains gene encoding putative terpene synthases tpss here report two rice sesquiterpene synthase gene ostps ostps encode e caryophyllene synthase e e farnesol synthase respectively in vitro recombinant protein ostps catalyzed formation e caryophyllene several sesquiterpenes including elemene humulene component inducible volatile rice plant the transcript level ostps exhibit circadian rhythm fluctuation expression also greatly induced methyl jasmonate meja in addition expression ostps transgenic plant arabidopsis thaliana resulted emitting high quantity ostps product we also overexpressed ostps rice plant produced e caryophyllene meja treatment finally found meja treated transgenic rice plant attracted parasitoid wasp anagrus nilaparvatae wild type these result demonstrate ostps enzyme catalyzing formation volatile sesquiterpenes play role indirect defense rice plant,low
175,The santalene synthase from Cinnamomum camphora: Reconstruction of a sesquiterpene synthase from a monoterpene synthase,"Abstract

Plant terpene synthases (TPSs) can mediate formation of a large variety of terpenes, and their diversification contributes to the specific chemical profiles of different plant species and chemotypes. Plant genomes often encode a number of related terpene synthases, which can produce very different terpenes. The relationship between TPS sequence and resulting terpene product is not completely understood. In this work we describe two TPSs from the Camphor tree Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl. One of these, CiCaMS, acts as a monoterpene synthase (monoTPS), and mediates the production of myrcene, while the other, CiCaSSy, acts as a sesquiterpene synthase (sesquiTPS), and catalyses the production of a-santalene, ß-santalene and trans-a-bergamotene. Interestingly, these enzymes share 97% DNA sequence identity and differ only in 22 amino acid residues out of 553. To understand which residues are essential for the catalysis of monoterpenes resp. sesquiterpenes, a number of hybrid synthases were prepared, and supplemented by a set of single-residue variants. These were tested for their ability to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes by in vivo production of sesquiterpenes in E. coli, and by in vitro enzyme assays. This analysis pinpointed three residues in the sequence which could mediate the change in product specificity from a monoterpene synthase to a sesquiterpene synthase. Another set of three residues defined the sesquiterpene product profile, including the ratios between sesquiterpene products.",abstract plant terpene synthases tpss mediate formation large variety terpene diversification contributes specific chemical profile different plant specie chemotypes plant genome often encode number related terpene synthases produce different terpene the relationship tps sequence resulting terpene product completely understood in work describe two tpss camphor tree cinnamomum camphora l presl one cicams act monoterpene synthase monotps mediates production myrcene cicassy act sesquiterpene synthase sesquitps catalysis production santalene santalene trans bergamotene interestingly enzyme share dna sequence identity differ amino acid residue to understand residue essential catalysis monoterpenes resp sesquiterpenes number hybrid synthases prepared supplemented set single residue variant these tested ability produce monoterpenes sesquiterpenes vivo production sesquiterpenes e coli vitro enzyme assay this analysis pinpointed three residue sequence could mediate change product specificity monoterpene synthase sesquiterpene synthase another set three residue defined sesquiterpene product profile including ratio sesquiterpene product,low

178,Three-step pathway engineering results in more incidence rate and higher emission of nerolidol and improved attraction of Diadegma semiclausum,"Abstract

The concentration and ratio of terpenoids in the headspace volatile blend of plants have a fundamental role in the communication of plants and insects. The sesquiterpene (E)-nerolidol is one of the important volatiles with effect on beneficial carnivores for biologic pest management in the field. To optimize de novo biosynthesis and reliable and uniform emission of (E)-nerolidol, we engineered different steps of the (E)-nerolidol biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana.

179,Tomato Fruits—A Platform for Metabolic Engineering of Terpenes,"Abstract

Terpenoids are a large and diverse class of plant metabolites including mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes. They have numerous functions in basic physiological processes as well as the interaction of plants with their biotic and abiotic environment. Due to the tight regulation of biosynthetic pathways and the resulting limited natural availability of terpenes, there is a strong interest in increasing their production in plants by metabolic engineering for agricultural, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications. The tomato fruit system was developed as a platform for metabolic engineering of terpenes to overcome detrimental effects on overall plant growth and photosynthesis traits, which are affected when terpenoid engineering is performed in vegetative tissues. Here we describe how the use of fruit-specific promoters for transgene expression can avoid these unwanted effects. In addition, targeting the expression of the introduced terpene biosynthetic gene to fruit tissue can take advantage of the large precursor pool provided by the methylerythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway, which is highly active during tomato fruit ripening to facilitate the accumulation of carotenoids. We also discuss how the production of high levels of target terpene compounds can be achieved in fruits by the expression of individual or a combination of (i) the MEP or mevalonic acid pathway enzymes, (ii) prenyltransferases, and/or (iii) terpene synthases. Finally, we provide a brief outline of how the emitted as well as internal pools of terpenes can be analyzed in transgenic tomato fruits.",abstract terpenoids large diverse class plant metabolite including mono sesqui diterpenes they numerous function basic physiological process well interaction plant biotic abiotic environment due tight regulation biosynthetic pathway resulting limited natural availability terpene strong interest increasing production plant metabolic engineering agricultural pharmaceutical industrial application the tomato fruit system developed platform metabolic engineering terpene overcome detrimental effect overall plant growth photosynthesis trait affected terpenoid engineering performed vegetative tissue here describe use fruit specific promoter transgene expression avoid unwanted effect in addition targeting expression introduced terpene biosynthetic gene fruit tissue take advantage large precursor pool provided methylerythritol phosphate mep pathway highly active tomato fruit ripening facilitate accumulation carotenoid we also discus production high level target terpene compound achieved fruit expression individual combination mep mevalonic acid pathway enzyme ii prenyltransferases iii terpene synthases finally provide brief outline emitted well internal pool terpene analyzed transgenic tomato fruit,high

For the first time, enrichment on solid sorbents followed by thermal desorption has been used for the determination of the enantiomeric signature of monoterpenes in the gaseous emission of terrestrial plants. A ß-cyclodextrin capillary column has been used for the separation of critical pairs. The temperature program and column loading were optimized for making the accurate quantification of individual enantiomers possible by mass spectrometry. The resolution achieved was sufficient for separating enantiomeric monoterpenes from other biogenic and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds present in air and vegetation emission samples. The method has been applied to the determination of the enantiomeric ratios of monoterpenes in the gaseous emissions of some evergreen plants and in the open atmosphere.",abstract for first time enrichment solid sorbent followed thermal desorption used determination enantiomeric signature monoterpenes gaseous emission terrestrial plant a cyclodextrin capillary column used separation critical pair the temperature program column loading optimized making accurate quantification individual enantiomer possible mass spectrometry the resolution achieved sufficient separating enantiomeric monoterpenes biogenic anthropogenic volatile organic compound present air vegetation emission sample the method applied determination enantiomeric ratio monoterpenes gaseous emission evergreen plant open atmosphere,low

Tubers of Curcuma wenyujin are rich in essential oils, mainly various sesquiterpenes, showing antibacterial, anti-viral and anti-tumor effects. However, the molecular mechanism of C. wenyujin is deficient and related sesquiterpene synthases are still unclear. In this study, the transcriptome data of tubers and leaves from C. wenyujin were obtained and assembled into 78 092 unigenes. Of them, 244 unigenes were predicted to be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis while 131 unigenes were categorized as the “Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis” (TBB) term. Twenty-two unigenes possessed terpene synthase domain; five were predicted to be sesquiterpene synthases. Of the 208 unigenes annotated as cytochromes P450, 8 unigenes with full-length coding sequences were part of the CYP71 clade that primarily may perform hydroxylations of specialized metabolites. Furthermore, Ten DEGs related to the C5 precursor supply and sesquiterpene synthesis were validated by Real-time PCR; that showed a close correspondence with transcriptome sequence. A novel germacrene B synthase (CwGBS) and a-santalene synthase (CwSS) were identified in metabolically engineering E. coli.

Centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides [Munro] Hack.) is a warm-season turfgrass, widely planted in residential lawns and recreational fields. Here, we uncovered three major terpenes released from the shoots of Eo: (E)-ß-ocimene (6%), a-muurolene (87.8%), and eremophilene (6.2%). Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment increased the emission of monoterpenes, including (E)- and (Z)-ß-ocimene, limonene, and myrcene, as well as sesquiterpene blends of (E)-caryophyllene, a-copaene, (+)-cyclosativene, and a-farnesene. RNA sequencing analysis predicted 14 putative Eo terpene synthase (EoTPS) genes, and two full-length EoTPS were successfully amplified: Eo7816 (1722 bp) and Eo6039 (1701 bp). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Eo7816 and Eo6039 belonged to the clades of TPS-b and TPS-a, respectively. The Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing Eo7816 exclusively released (E)-ß-ocimene (96%) with (Z)-ß-ocimene and myrcene. In contrast, Eo6039-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants emitted significant amounts of a-muurolene (69.4%) and eremophilene (21.8%).

183,Utilisation of the MVA pathway to produce elevated levels of the sesquiterpene a-copaene in potato tubers,"Abstract

Potato flavour is a complex trait resulting from the presence of a combination of volatile and non-volatile compounds. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of specifically altering the volatile content of tubers and assess its impact on flavour. Tuber-specific over-expression of a potato a-copaene synthase gene resulted in enhanced levels (up to 15-fold higher than controls) of the sesquiterpene a-copaene. A positive correlation (R2 = 0.8) between transgene expression level and a-copaene abundance was observed. No significant changes in the levels of volatiles other than a-copaene were detected. Non-volatile flavour compounds (sugars, glycoalkaloids, major umami amino acids and 5'-ribonucleotides) were also determined. Relationships between flavour compounds and sensory evaluation data were investigated. Evaluators could not detect any aroma differences in the transgenic samples compared with controls and no significant differences in taste attributes were found. Thus although successful engineering of potato tubers to accumulate high levels of the flavour volatile a-copaene was achieved, sensory analysis suggests that a-copaene is not a major component of potato flavour.",abstract potato flavour complex trait resulting presence combination volatile non volatile compound the aim work investigate effect specifically altering volatile content tuber ass impact flavour tuber specific expression potato copaene synthase gene resulted enhanced level fold higher control sesquiterpene copaene a positive correlation r transgene expression level copaene abundance observed no significant change level volatile copaene detected non volatile flavour compound sugar glycoalkaloids major umami amino acid ribonucleotides also determined relationships flavour compound sensory evaluation data investigated evaluators could detect aroma difference transgenic sample compared control significant difference taste attribute found thus although successful engineering potato tuber accumulate high level flavour volatile copaene achieved sensory analysis suggests copaene major component potato flavour,low
184,Transcriptomic analysis of postharvest toon buds and key enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis during cold storage,"Abstract

Toon buds have been used in China as an important woody vegetable for its unique flavor. However, the changes of volatile terpenoids related to flavor and their biosynthesis in postharvest toon buds after cold storage remain largely unknown. Therefore, a transcriptomic database must be constructed to analyze the molecular mechanism of terpenoid biosynthesis in toon buds during cold storage. The chemical profiles of volatile terpenoids over postharvest storage periods were comparatively analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Results showed that the total content of volatile terpenoids and their oxidates, except for monoterpenes and a small portion of sesquiterpenes, increased significantly after cold storage. The transcriptome database derived from different cold storage times was established using BGIseq500 technology. Approximately 6.5?g of clean nucleotides were obtained and de novo assembled into 152 127 non-redundant unigenes, approximately 72.36% of which could be aligned to public databases. Many candidate genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis were identified. Furthermore, 29 513 unigenes were demonstrated to be differentially expressed under different cold storage times. These differentially expressed genes were functionally annotated by gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses. The expression of 20 putative unigenes involved in terpenoid pathways was confirmed by qRT-PCR, the results of which were consistent with the RNA-seq data. These genes with different expression patterns correlated well with the changes in the volatile terpenoids in the toon buds during low-temperature storage. In summary, our results showed that the high expression levels of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathways contributed to sesquiterpene biosynthesis after cold storage, which led to high sesquiterpene accumulation in toon buds during low-temperature storage.",abstract toon bud used china important woody vegetable unique flavor however change volatile terpenoids related flavor biosynthesis postharvest toon bud cold storage remain largely unknown therefore transcriptomic database must constructed analyze molecular mechanism terpenoid biosynthesis toon bud cold storage the chemical profile volatile terpenoids postharvest storage period comparatively analyzed gas chromatography mass spectrometry results showed total content volatile terpenoids oxidates except monoterpenes small portion sesquiterpenes increased significantly cold storage the transcriptome database derived different cold storage time established using bgiseq technology approximately g clean nucleotide obtained de novo assembled non redundant unigenes approximately could aligned public database many candidate gene involved terpenoid biosynthesis identified furthermore unigenes demonstrated differentially expressed different cold storage time these differentially expressed gene functionally annotated gene ontology enrichment kyoto encyclopedia genes genomes enrichment analysis the expression putative unigenes involved terpenoid pathway confirmed qrt pcr result consistent rna seq data these gene different expression pattern correlated well change volatile terpenoids toon bud low temperature storage in summary result showed high expression level terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway contributed sesquiterpene biosynthesis cold storage led high sesquiterpene accumulation toon bud low temperature storage,low

In the present study, the effects of elevated UV-B (eUVB; ambient ± 7.2 kJ m-2 day-1) were evaluated on the biochemical and metabolic profile of Adhatoda vasica Nees. (an indigenous medicinal plant) at different growth stages. The results showed reduction in superoxide radical production rate, whereas increase in the content of hydrogen peroxide which was also substantiated by the histochemical localization. Malondialdehyde content, which is a measure of oxidative stress, did not show significant changes at any of the growth stages however photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content showed reduction at all growth stages under eUV-B exposure. Increased activities of the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were noticed except ascorbic acid, which was reduced under eUV-B exposure. The metabolic profile of A. vasica revealed 43 major compounds (assigned under different classes) at different growth stages. Triterpenes, phytosterols, unsaturated fatty acids, diterpenes, tocopherols, and alkaloids showed increment, whereas reduction in saturated fatty acids and sesquiterpenes were observed under eUV-B treatment. Vasicinone and vasicoline, the two important alkaloids of A. vasica, showed significant induction under eUV-B exposure as compared to control. Treatment of eUV-B leads to the synthesis of some new compounds, such as oridonin oxide (diterpene) and a-Bisabolol oxide-B (sesquiterpene), which possess potent anti-inflammatory and anticancerous activities.

186,Understanding the consequence of environmental stress for accumulation of secondary metabolites in medicinal and aromatic plants,"Abstract

Abiotic stresses are the most critical hurdle for the growth and development of the plants. The abiotic stresses are salinity, heat, drought, flood, heavy metals and plant nutrients. Plants develop different tolerance mechanisms such as adjustment of membrane system, maintenance of cell wall architecture, production of secondary metabolites and antioxidants, phytohormones, and accumulation of osmolytes in response to abiotic stresses. The secondary metabolites, developed through various physiological and biochemical process, play vital role to cope up with different stresses. The presence of these compounds in the plant acts as an interface with its adverse environment. Primary metabolites are the precursors for the secondary metabolites production in plants, but its concentration and transport are influenced with the changes in climatic conditions. Stress conditions also enhance the expression level of corresponding genes involved in the natural product biosynthesis. The secondary metabolites produced as a result of abiotic stresses are involved in plant defence system for survival. Secondary metabolites never participate in building block processes rather they function to deal with many external agents. They also protect plant from various biotic stresses and facilitate in pollination and fruit dispersal mechanism by attracting the pollinating and dispersing agent through their beautiful colour and fragrance.

Aromatic and medicinal plants, through their secondary metabolism, provide a complex mixture of volatile molecules known as essential oils. These volatile molecules exert antibacterial activity that has been used in folk medicine for centuries. During the last few decades, the emergence of antibacterial resistance has forced us to search for new and efficient antimicrobial agents. The significant number of studies on the use of essential oils and their components against multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa show the exceptional potential of these natural products to curb the development of antibacterial resistance. Moreover, the use of essential oils and their components in combination with antibiotics may increase bacterial susceptibility, thus limiting resistance.",abstract aromatic medicinal plant secondary metabolism provide complex mixture volatile molecule known essential oil these volatile molecule exert antibacterial activity used folk medicine century during last decade emergence antibacterial resistance forced u search new efficient antimicrobial agent the significant number study use essential oil component multidrug resistant bacteria acinetobacter baumannii methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mycobacterium tuberculosis pseudomonas aeruginosa show exceptional potential natural product curb development antibacterial resistance moreover use essential oil component combination antibiotic may increase bacterial susceptibility thus limiting resistance,low

The diverse array of terpenoids has increased the interest in their commercial and pharmaceutical uses due to their antioxidative, anti-inflammation, and anticancer properties. Based on the structure, terpenoids are divided into six classes, namely monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, tetraterpenes, and polyterpenes. Several terpenoids have been found to exhibit anticancer property via acting on different stages of tumor development, such as inhibition of the early initiation and progression of tumorigenesis by inducing cell cycle arrest, tumor cell differentiation, and apoptosis, and in the late stages, suppression of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis through the regulation of various intracellular signaling pathways. A relevant progress in the delineation of the detailed mechanism of their anticancer action has made these compounds as a promising therapeutic agents.

Since several mono- and sesquiterpenoids, like artemisinin, menthol and nootkatone, have proven beneficial for mankind, they also possess high socio-economic value. The general mechanisms of terpene biosynthesis are understood and enzymes catalysing the formation of the isoprenoid basic carbon skeletons have been described frequently. In the subsequent pathway steps, it is mainly cytochromes P450 that catalyse the decoration of these basic skeletons and thereby contribute significantly to the structural diversity observed. Structure–function relationship, even though discussed intensively, is poorly understood for this enzyme family; even with the phylogenic relationship well established identification of the functionality of the single enzymes is challenging, and, so far, only a few have been characterized.

(Moraceae) to investigate gene regulation involved in the biosynthesis of pollinator attracting volatiles,"Flower volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the receptive figs of Ficus (Moraceae) play important roles in maintaining the specificity of pollinator attraction and reproductive isolation between host species. The dominant components of VOCs are terpenoids, and while the genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis are known, we know very little about the regulation of these genes and its relationship to pollinator attraction in Ficus. Thus, we selected pre-receptive (pre-VOC attractant-emitting) and receptive (VOC attractant-emitting) phase female flowers of a dioecious fig for transcriptome sequencing to investigate the differential activity of genes, including those related to terpenoid biosynthesis. We annoted 53,445 unigenes, of which 608 were found to be differently expressed in the two stages, with 242 unigenes upregulated and 366 unigenes downregulated in pre-receptive relative to receptive phase flowers. With respect to the production of VOCs, 80 unigenes encoded 34 enzyme-coding genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, including nearly all key enzymes of the MVA and MEP pathways forming the backbone of terpenoid biosynthesis. We designed pair primers for 16 of these 34 enzyme genes and validated 5 of them in 30 Ficus species representing 6 subgenera. In addition to the transcript sequences, we identified 35,558 putative microsatellite loci and designed primers for 11,468 of them.

192,Developmental variations in sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis in East Indian sandalwood tree (Santalum album L.),"The East Indian sandalwood tree, Santalum album L. is known for its fragrant heartwood and essential oil. The major bioactive principles of sandalwood oil, i.e., sesquiterpenoids (C15 isoprenoids), are known as ‘santalols’ and are globally used in medicinal, cosmetic, dietary, and aromatherapeutic applications. However, there are no available reports on the biosynthesis and metabolism of isoprenoids in this forest tree. Hence, we provide detailed insights into sesquiterpenoid metabolism across several in vitro and in vivo developmental stages. Since no molecular information was available, several genes encoding enzymes participating in early and critical steps of isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways were isolated using degenerate primers, and their expression patterns across the developmental stages were studied by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results indicate that the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is differentially regulated with development and in tissue-specific manner. Accumulation of plastidial isoprenoid pigments increased with development, while the amounts of farnesylated intermediates decreased with maturation, thereby possibly indicating conversion into sesquiterpenoids. A differential expression pattern was observed for hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and 1-deoxyxyulose-5-phosphate synthase at the levels of transcripts and proteins, indicating post-transcriptional regulation. Transcript levels of farnesyl pyrophsophate, sesquiterpene and monoterpene synthases were quantitatively higher in callus, and lower in matured tree leaves. Sesquiterpene synthase activity across different developmental stages indicated a tissue-specific conversion and accumulation.

194,Direct suppression of a rice bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) by monoterpene (S)-limonene,"Rice bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is a severe disease of rice plants. Upon pathogen infection, rice biosynthesizes phytoalexins, including diterpenoids such as momilactones, phytocassanes, and oryzalexins. However, information on headspace volatiles in response to Xoo infection is limited. We have examined headspace volatile terpenes, induced by the infection of Xoo, and investigated their biological roles in the rice plant. Monoterpenes a-thujene, a-pinene, sabinene, myrcene, a-terpene, and (S)-limonene and sesquiterpenes cyclosativene, a-copaene, and ß-elemene were detected from 1-week-old Xoo-infected rice seedlings, by solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. All monoterpenes were constitutively released from rice seedlings before Xoo infection. However, (S)-limonene emission was further elicited after exposure of the seedlings to Xoo in coincidence with upregulation of limonene synthase gene (OsTPS20) transcripts. Only the stereospecific (S)-limonene [and not (R)-limonene or other monoterpenes] severely inhibited Xoo growth, as confirmed by disc diffusion and liquid culture assays. Rice seedlings showed suppressed pathogenic symptoms suggestive of resistance to Xoo infection after foliar treatment with (S)-limonene. Collectively, our findings suggest that (S)-limonene is a volatile phytoanticipin, which plays a significant role in suppressing Xoo growth in rice seedlings.",rice bacterial blight caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo severe disease rice plant upon pathogen infection rice biosynthesizes phytoalexins including diterpenoids momilactones phytocassanes oryzalexins however information headspace volatile response xoo infection limited we examined headspace volatile terpene induced infection xoo investigated biological role rice plant monoterpenes thujene pinene sabinene myrcene terpene s limonene sesquiterpenes cyclosativene copaene elemene detected week old xoo infected rice seedling solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry all monoterpenes constitutively released rice seedling xoo infection however s limonene emission elicited exposure seedling xoo coincidence upregulation limonene synthase gene ostps transcript only stereospecific s limonene r limonene monoterpenes severely inhibited xoo growth confirmed disc diffusion liquid culture assay rice seedling showed suppressed pathogenic symptom suggestive resistance xoo infection foliar treatment s limonene collectively finding suggest s limonene volatile phytoanticipin play significant role suppressing xoo growth rice seedling,low

They included genes coding for a series of redox partners that transfer the electrons from NAD(P)H to a P450 protein. The redox partners used were ferredoxin reductases (CamA and NsRED) and ferredoxins (CamB and NsFER), which are derived from Pseudomonas putida and cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7120, respectively, as well as three higher-plant NADPH-P450 reductases, the Arabidopsis thaliana ATR2 and two corresponding enzymes derived from ginger (Zingiber officinale), named ZoRED1 and ZoRED2. We also constructed plasmids for functional analysis of two P450s, a-humulene-8-hydroxylase (CYP71BA1) from shampoo ginger (Zingiber zerumbet) and germacrene A hydroxylase (P450NS; CYP110C1) from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, and co-transformed E. coli with each of the pAC-Mv-based plasmids. Production levels of 8-hydroxy-a-humulene with recombinant E. coli cells (for CYP71BA1) were 1.5- to 2.3-fold higher than that of a control strain without the mevalonate-pathway genes. Level of the P450NS product with the combination of NsRED and NsFER was 2.9-fold higher than that of the CamA and CamB.

We expressed in Escherichia coli a Streptomyces mevalonate pathway gene cluster starting from HMG-CoA synthase and including isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (idi) type 2 gene and the yeast idi type 1 and rat acetoacetate-CoA ligase (Aacl) genes. When the a-humulene synthase (ZSS1) gene of shampoo ginger was expressed in this transformant, the resultant E. coli produced 958 µg/mL culture of a-humulene with a lithium acetoacetate (LAA) supplement, which was a 13.6-fold increase compared with a control E. coli strain expressing only ZSS1. Next, we investigated if this E. coli strain engineered to utilize acetoacetate can synthesize carotenoids effectively. When the crtE, crtB, and crtI genes required for lycopene synthesis were expressed in the transformant, lycopene amounts reached 12.5 mg/g dry cell weight with addition of LAA, an 11.8-fold increase compared with a control expressing only the three crt genes. As for astaxanthin production with the E. coli transformant, in which the crtE, crtB, crtI, crtY, crtZ, and crtW genes were expressed, the total amount of carotenoids produced (astaxanthin, lycopene, and phytoene) was significantly increased to 7.5 times that of a control expressing only the six crt genes.",we show efficient synthesis system isoprenoids acetoacetate main substrate we expressed escherichia coli streptomyces mevalonate pathway gene cluster starting hmg coa synthase including isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase idi type gene yeast idi type rat acetoacetate coa ligase aacl gene when humulene synthase zss gene shampoo ginger expressed transformant resultant e coli produced g ml culture humulene lithium acetoacetate laa supplement fold increase compared control e coli strain expressing zss next investigated e coli strain engineered utilize acetoacetate synthesize carotenoid effectively when crte crtb crti gene required lycopene synthesis expressed transformant lycopene amount reached mg g dry cell weight addition laa fold increase compared control expressing three crt gene as astaxanthin production e coli transformant crte crtb crti crty crtz crtw gene expressed total amount carotenoid produced astaxanthin lycopene phytoene significantly increased time control expressing six crt gene,low
199,"Elucidating the Formation of Geranyllinalool, the Precursor of the Volatile C16-Homoterpene TMTT Involved in Indirect Plant Defense","Plants produce volatile compounds as communication signals for the interaction with other organisms. The volatile C16-homoterpene TMTT (4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene) is released from the foliage of many plants including Arabidopsis thaliana upon herbivore attack and is assumed to play a role in attracting parasitoids or predators of herbivores. Despite the widespread occurrence of TMTT, its biosynthesis is not well understood. We have identified Arabidopsis TPS04 (At1g61120) as the terpene synthase catalyzing the first dedicated step in TMTT formation. TPS04 functions as a geranyllinalool synthase (GES) by converting the C20 diterpene precursor all-trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into the C20 tertiary alcohol (E,E)-geranyllinalool (GL). GL is further converted into TMTT by enzymatic oxidative degradation. Arabidopsis TPS04 gene knockout lines are deficient in the formation of GL and TMTT. This phenotype is complemented by expression of GES under control of an alcohol-inducible or constitutive promoter. Constitutive formation of GL and TMTT causes the appearance of lesions on cotyledons and leads to reduced growth. Transcription of GES and the synthesis of GL and TMTT are induced by feeding of the crucifer-specialist Plutella xylostella and by treatment with the fungal elicitor alamethicin or the jasmonate mimic coronalon. Regulation of GES transcription is dependent on the octadecanoid-dependent signaling pathway and is not modified by salicylic acid or ethylene. In contrast to other diterpene synthases, GES is not located in plastids but resides instead in the cytosol or the endoplasmic reticulum. The identification of GES provides a useful tool to further investigate the specific role of TMTT in plant–organism interactions and to elucidate the TMTT biosynthetic pathway and its regulation.",plants produce volatile compound communication signal interaction organism the volatile c homoterpene tmtt trimethyltrideca tetraene released foliage many plant including arabidopsis thaliana upon herbivore attack assumed play role attracting parasitoids predator herbivore despite widespread occurrence tmtt biosynthesis well understood we identified arabidopsis tps at g terpene synthase catalyzing first dedicated step tmtt formation tps function geranyllinalool synthase ges converting c diterpene precursor trans geranylgeranyl diphosphate ggpp c tertiary alcohol e e geranyllinalool gl gl converted tmtt enzymatic oxidative degradation arabidopsis tps gene knockout line deficient formation gl tmtt this phenotype complemented expression ges control alcohol inducible constitutive promoter constitutive formation gl tmtt cause appearance lesion cotyledon lead reduced growth transcription ges synthesis gl tmtt induced feeding crucifer specialist plutella xylostella treatment fungal elicitor alamethicin jasmonate mimic coronalon regulation ges transcription dependent octadecanoid dependent signaling pathway modified salicylic acid ethylene in contrast diterpene synthases ges located plastid resides instead cytosol endoplasmic reticulum the identification ges provides useful tool investigate specific role tmtt plant organism interaction elucidate tmtt biosynthetic pathway regulation,low
200,Elucidating the Metabolism of Plant Terpene Volatiles: Alternative Tools for Engineering Plant Defenses?,"Plants produce a diversity of volatile organic compounds that have important ecological functions. When emitted from plants upon herbivore damage, volatiles serve as direct defense compounds or attract natural enemies of herbivores, a response known as “indirect defense.” Terpene metabolites constitute a predominant group of plant volatiles with recognized function in plant defense. The possibility of developing alternative pest control strategies based on these natural defenses has fueled novel attempts to metabolically engineer volatile emissions and enhance their effectiveness in plant defense. We address recent advances in this area with an emphasis on homoterpene volatiles. We show that the Arabidopsis model serves as an important resource, which provides molecular and genetic tools to investigate and manipulate the biosynthesis of volatile terpenes, especially homoterpenes, and to decipher their roles in plant defense responses.",plants produce diversity volatile organic compound important ecological function when emitted plant upon herbivore damage volatile serve direct defense compound attract natural enemy herbivore response known indirect defense terpene metabolite constitute predominant group plant volatile recognized function plant defense the possibility developing alternative pest control strategy based natural defense fueled novel attempt metabolically engineer volatile emission enhance effectiveness plant defense we address recent advance area emphasis homoterpene volatile we show arabidopsis model serf important resource provides molecular genetic tool investigate manipulate biosynthesis volatile terpene especially homoterpenes decipher role plant defense response,low
201,Endogenous plant metabolites against insects,"Herbivorous insects are responsible for large losses to agriculture through feeding damage itself but also by vectoring pathogens such as viruses. Plants have evolved various mechanisms to defend themselves against insects, including the production of specialised metabolites that act as natural insecticides. Throughout history, plants and plant extracts harbouring specialised metabolites have been exploited by man for their anti-insect properties. Also, commercial insecticides are often based on plant-specialised metabolites and adapted further e.g. to give them the physicochemical properties that render them systemic. The development and application of these synthetic pesticides has made it possible to scale up the production and to increase the yield of food crops worldwide. However, their adversary effects on the environment and on non-target organisms, first discussed in Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, continue to cause debate and recently resulted in a ban on the use of certain pesticides in the European Union. The trait of insect defence has been largely overlooked during crop domestication and resulted in basically unarmed crop plants. Endogenous production of specialised metabolites could be re-introduced in modern crop varieties to retrieve self-defences. However, despite the fact that a plethora of specialised metabolites from plants has been described, studies that validate their deterrent or insecticidal effect in planta (crop), let alone in field situations, are sparse. To answer the question whether it is feasible to re-introduce endogenous insecticides to bring about insect resistance, the defence metabolites of plants, their synthesis and regulatory mechanisms underlying their production are examined.",herbivorous insect responsible large loss agriculture feeding damage also vectoring pathogen virus plants evolved various mechanism defend insect including production specialised metabolite act natural insecticide throughout history plant plant extract harbouring specialised metabolite exploited man anti insect property also commercial insecticide often based plant specialised metabolite adapted e g give physicochemical property render systemic the development application synthetic pesticide made possible scale production increase yield food crop worldwide however adversary effect environment non target organism first discussed rachel carson silent spring continue cause debate recently resulted ban use certain pesticide european union the trait insect defence largely overlooked crop domestication resulted basically unarmed crop plant endogenous production specialised metabolite could introduced modern crop variety retrieve self defence however despite fact plethora specialised metabolite plant described study validate deterrent insecticidal effect planta crop let alone field situation sparse to answer question whether feasible introduce endogenous insecticide bring insect resistance defence metabolite plant synthesis regulatory mechanism underlying production examined,low

203,Environmental Impacts on Plant Volatile Emission,"Plants in their natural environment are often exposed to a variety of environmental stresses. This chapter emphasises the importance of distinguishing among stress effects on constitutive and stress-induced volatile emissions and, within constitutive emissions, among stress effects on emissions from specialised storage compartments (storage emissions) and de novo emissions. Among constitutive emissions, de novo emissions are typically more sensitive to stress than storage emissions. Depending on stress severity, the emission response is either physiological or the emission response is controlled at the gene expression level. This chapter analyses the impacts of heat, cold, drought and waterlogging stresses on constitutive and induced emissions, highlights similarities and differences of various stresses on volatile release and outlines the gaps in knowledge. We argue that for a fully mechanistic understanding of environmental impacts on plant chemical communication channels, more work is needed to obtain quantitative stress dose versus emission responses for different stresses in species of differing stress tolerance.",plants natural environment often exposed variety environmental stress this chapter emphasis importance distinguishing among stress effect constitutive stress induced volatile emission within constitutive emission among stress effect emission specialised storage compartment storage emission de novo emission among constitutive emission de novo emission typically sensitive stress storage emission depending stress severity emission response either physiological emission response controlled gene expression level this chapter analysis impact heat cold drought waterlogging stress constitutive induced emission highlight similarity difference various stress volatile release outline gap knowledge we argue fully mechanistic understanding environmental impact plant chemical communication channel work needed obtain quantitative stress dose versus emission response different stress specie differing stress tolerance,low

206,Essential Oils: An Update on Their Biosynthesis and Genetic Strategies to Overcome the Production Challenges,"Essential oils, secreted by plants, are primarily meant for various physiological, ecological, and defense activities. These oils belong to various classes, i.e., isolates of fatty acids, isoprenoids, and phenolic complexes, and can be secreted by various organs of plants. The essential oil market globally has been predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~8–10%, and reach a staggering figure in excess of USD ten billion in the next 5 years or so. However, the challenge lies in commercial production, keeping pace with the demand, since their natural production in plants is in considerably low quantities, which depends on ecological conditions and growth stages of the plant. Although several investigations exist in the literature, there is a pressing need for a systematic review of the recent updates, particularly concerning the strategies that facilitate the manufacturing of such indispensable oils. The current chapter focuses on various facets of essential oil production, the associated challenges, and the promise of genetic alteration techniques for enhanced essential oil production. Several distinct perspectives have been considered, such as different sources and mechanisms of essential oil biomanufacturing, including their role in plant defense, the array of isolation procedures, and their wide ranges of beneficial attributes, particularly catering to the therapeutic potential, and challenges and metabolic engineering characteristics.

207,Exogenous methyl jasmonate prevents necrosis caused by mechanical wounding and increases terpenoid biosynthesis in Panax ginseng,"
Upon mechanical wounding, plants locally induce necrosis, accumulate methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and acquire systemic resistance in nearby tissues. One-month-old in vitro grown Panax ginseng seedlings were treated with either 50 µM MeJA or mechanical wounding alone or a combination of both, to evaluate jasmonic acid (JA) signaling and terpene biosynthetic pathway genes along with terpenoid accumulation. After MeJA treatment, JA pathway genes, such as lipoxygenase (PgLOX), hydrogen peroxidase lyase (PgHPL), allene oxide synthase (PgAOS), and allene oxide cyclase (PgAOC1), and terpene pathway genes, such as isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (PgIPP) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (PgFPS), were highly expressed and resulted in the accumulation of mono- and sesquiterpenes. During mechanical wounding, PgLOX expression was induced relatively late after 72 h of treatment, however PgAOC1 was not induced. This resulted in decreased production of MeJA that in turn may have lowered terpenoid production. In contrast, wounding + MeJA treatment increased PgAOC1 and PgLOX gene expression earlier after 6 h and slowly promoted the production of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Furthermore, we monitored the effect of MeJA upon wounding in in vitro grown 1-month-old seedlings treated with MeJA + wounding. These result demonstrated that exogenous MeJA is able to promote recovery from the wounding effect by functioning as a long distance signal. Additionally, these results suggest that exogenous MeJA supplied at the time of mechanical wounding prevents necrosis in the ginseng leaves by increasing the production of terpenoids.

208,Floral Scents and Fruit Aromas Inspired by Nature,"Plants use floral and fruit volatiles as chemical cues to interact with their environment by attracting pollinators and seed dispersers, thus ensuring plant reproductive success. These volatiles also have a significant economic value as they contribute directly to the quality, and indirectly to the yield, of crops. The scent of flowers and the aroma of fruits are composed of complex mixtures of tens or sometimes hundreds of volatile compounds, many of which are found in both flowers and fruits. Arising from diverse biochemical pathways, floral and fruit volatiles can be divided into four major classes according to their metabolic origin: terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, fatty acid derivatives and amino acid derivatives. Recent discoveries of genes and enzymes responsible for the formation of volatile compounds have facilitated the investigation of the regulation of the biosynthesis of flower and fruit volatiles. Our growing understanding of the plant volatile network, together with pioneering attempts for fragrance modification, provide a platform for future metabolic engineering of floral scent and fruit aroma for plant improvement and human enjoyment.",plants use floral fruit volatile chemical cue interact environment attracting pollinator seed dispersers thus ensuring plant reproductive success these volatile also significant economic value contribute directly quality indirectly yield crop the scent flower aroma fruit composed complex mixture ten sometimes hundred volatile compound many found flower fruit arising diverse biochemical pathway floral fruit volatile divided four major class according metabolic origin terpenoids phenylpropanoids benzenoids fatty acid derivative amino acid derivative recent discovery gene enzyme responsible formation volatile compound facilitated investigation regulation biosynthesis flower fruit volatile our growing understanding plant volatile network together pioneering attempt fragrance modification provide platform future metabolic engineering floral scent fruit aroma plant improvement human enjoyment,high
209,Fragrance Stimulation Mechanisms of Flowers and their Regulation Under Environmental Constraints,"Flower fragrance appears as a fascinating facet to attract humans and has significant influence on human lives and in plant reproduction via attracting pollinators to perform fertilization hence, possess substantial economic significance. At present, cultivators are primarily paid for high productivity rather than for fragrance; hence, less attention is given to increase desirable fragrance. However, flower fragrance has received extreme focus of researchers nowadays to gain knowledge about the formation, emission, and regulation of volatile compounds present in the flowers. Various scent controlling genes and scent gene-encoding enzymes that are directly involved in the synthesis of floral volatiles, have been identified in the past two decades. The purpose of the present review is (i) to summarize the need of enhancement in the flower fragrance, (ii) an overview of various floral volatiles biosynthetic pathways and AAAs-derived biosynthetic pathways to mediate floral scent in flowers, (iii) to understand bacterial biochemical transformation involved in the production of floral-scent-related compounds, (iv) to determine the influence of various transcription factors, genes and transporters in the regulation of flower fragrance, and (v) to explore the effect of various environmental factors viz., pollution, temperature, drought etc. on floral scent. Therefore, knowledge about the synthesis and accumulation of various specialized metabolites and their regulatory mechanism is of utmost importance. This will result in regulation and improvement in flowers with respect to their fragrance. Development of genotypes with high or modified flower fragrance is a key target. In addition, improved floral-scent emission is considered as a vital commercial profit. Very few reports are available on flower fragrance enhancement via various biosynthetic products in various cultivars. The present review paper emphasizes the role of various biosynthetic products in the regulation of flower fragrance at both biochemical and molecular levels.

212,Functional identification and differential expression of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase in induced terpenoid resin formation of Norway spruce (Picea abies),"Conifers produce terpenoid-based oleoresins as constitutive and inducible defenses against herbivores and pathogens. Much information is available about the genes and enzymes of the late steps of oleoresin terpenoid biosynthesis in conifers, but almost nothing is known about the early steps which proceed via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Here we report the cDNA cloning and functional identification of three Norway spruce (Picea abies) genes encoding 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), which catalyzes the first step of the MEP pathway, and their differential expression in the stems of young saplings. Among them are representatives of both types of plant DXS genes. A single type I DXS gene is constitutively expressed in bark tissue and not affected by wounding or fungal application. In contrast, two distinct type II DXS genes, PaDXS2A and PaDXS2B, showed increased transcript abundance after these treatments as did two other genes of the MEP pathway tested, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and 4-hydroxyl 3-methylbutenyl diphosphate reductase (HDR). We also measured gene expression in a Norway spruce cell suspension culture system that, like intact trees, accumulates monoterpenes after treatment with methyl jasmonate. These cell cultures were characterized by an up-regulation of monoterpene synthase gene transcripts and enzyme activity after elicitor treatment, as well as induced formation of octadecanoids, including jasmonic acid and 12-oxophytodienoic acid. Among the Type II DXS genes in cell cultures, PaDXS2A was induced by treatment with chitosan, methyl salicylate, and Ceratocystis polonica (a bark beetle-associated, blue-staining fungal pathogen of Norway spruce). However, PaDXS2B was induced by treatment with methyl jasmonate and chitosan, but was not affected by methyl salicylate or C. polonica.

213,General Overview of Plant Secondary Metabolism,"The aim of this chapter is to ask and answer basic questions about plant secondary metabolism. It attempts to justify its chemical diversity and looks at where and how secondary metabolites are synthesized and stored, at the level of the cell and the whole plant, taking into account the variations in space and time. The question of why plants synthesize secondary metabolites is approached from three points of view: specific physiological functions and intra- and interspecific interactions. The interspecific relations can be plant-plant (allelopathy), plant-microorganisms/fungi and plant-animal. In the overview of the biosynthetic processes, plant secondary metabolites are classified into three basic groups: glucide (glucides, glycosides and the shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway), lipid (acetate malonate pathway and terpenes) and nitrogenated metabolites (non-proteinogenic amino acids, secondary peptides, cyanogenic compounds, glucosinolates and alkaloids).",the aim chapter ask answer basic question plant secondary metabolism it attempt justify chemical diversity look secondary metabolite synthesized stored level cell whole plant taking account variation space time the question plant synthesize secondary metabolite approached three point view specific physiological function intra interspecific interaction the interspecific relation plant plant allelopathy plant microorganism fungi plant animal in overview biosynthetic process plant secondary metabolite classified three basic group glucide glucides glycoside shikimate phenylpropanoid pathway lipid acetate malonate pathway terpene nitrogenated metabolite non proteinogenic amino acid secondary peptide cyanogenic compound glucosinolates alkaloid,low

Triterpene glycosides characterized by a 30 carbon atoms, namely oxidosqualene, a major precursor for triterpene aglycone (sapogenin), to which sugar chains are attached to yield the corresponding saponin compounds. However, saponin applications are often limited due to the low yields or accumulation in planta, inadequate of natural resources and the continuous need of the new compounds with superior biological activities. In addition, the biosynthesis and regulatory pathways of the saponin compounds in different plant species are still very limited. Thus development of new methods to improve and diversify the production of saponin glycosides, with a foresight into metabolic engineering, can be an alternative solution to avoid the problem associated with saponin large scale production. In this chapter, we will summarized and discussed the available information regarding saponin engineering in plant and their potential applications for plant disease resistance.",plant main source natural product diverse chemical structure biological activity among different plant derived natural product saponin secondary metabolite widely distributed across diverse plant specie great potential pharmaceutical industry detergent pesticide plant disease management triterpene glycoside characterized carbon atom namely oxidosqualene major precursor triterpene aglycone sapogenin sugar chain attached yield corresponding saponin compound however saponin application often limited due low yield accumulation planta inadequate natural resource continuous need new compound superior biological activity in addition biosynthesis regulatory pathway saponin compound different plant specie still limited thus development new method improve diversify production saponin glycoside foresight metabolic engineering alternative solution avoid problem associated saponin large scale production in chapter summarized discussed available information regarding saponin engineering plant potential application plant disease resistance,high
217,"Genetically engineering cyanobacteria to convert CO2, water, and light into the long-chain hydrocarbon farnesene","Genetically engineered cyanobacteria offer a shortcut to convert CO2 and H2O directly into biofuels and high value chemicals for societal benefits. Farnesene, a long-chained hydrocarbon (C15H24), has many applications in lubricants, cosmetics, fragrances, and biofuels. However, a method for the sustainable, photosynthetic production of farnesene has been lacking. Here, we report the photosynthetic production of farnesene by the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 using only CO2, mineralized water, and light. A codon-optimized farnesene synthase gene was chemically synthesized and then expressed in the cyanobacterium, enabling it to synthesize farnesene through its endogenous non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway. Farnesene excreted from the engineered cyanobacterium volatilized into the flask head space and was recovered by adsorption in a resin column. The maximum photosynthetic productivity of farnesene was 69.1?±?1.8 µg·L-1·O.D.-1·d-1. Compared to the wild type, the farnesene-producing cyanobacterium also exhibited a 60 % higher PSII activity under high light, suggesting increased farnesene productivity in such conditions.

218,Genome organization in Arabidopsis thaliana: a survey for genes involved in isoprenoid and chlorophyll metabolism,"The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway provides intermediates for the synthesis of a multitude of natural products which serve numerous biochemical functions in plants: sterols (isoprenoids with a C30 backbone) are essential components of membranes; carotenoids (C40) and chlorophylls (which contain a C20 isoprenoid side-chain) act as photosynthetic pigments; plastoquinone, phylloquinone and ubiquinone (all of which contain long isoprenoid side-chains) participate in electron transport chains; gibberellins (C20), brassinosteroids (C30) and abscisic acid (C15) are phytohormones derived from isoprenoid intermediates; prenylation of proteins (with C15 or C20 isoprenoid moieties) may mediate subcellular targeting and regulation of activity; and several monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and diterpenes (C20) have been demonstrated to be involved in plant defense. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genes coding for enzymes involved in the metabolism of isoprenoid-derived compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana. By combining homology and sequence motif searches with knowledge regarding the phylogenetic distribution of pathways of isoprenoid metabolism across species, candidate genes for these pathways in A. thaliana were obtained. A detailed analysis of the vicinity of chromosome loci for genes of isoprenoid metabolism in A. thaliana provided evidence for the clustering of genes involved in common pathways. Multiple sequence alignments were used to estimate the number of genes in gene families and sequence relationship trees were utilized to classify their individual members.

219,Genome-wide detection and classification of terpene synthase genes in Aquilaria agallochum,"Agarwood, one of the precious woods in the globe, is produced by Aquilaria plant species during an upshot of wounding and infection. Produced as a defence response, the dark, fragrant resin gets secreted in the plant’s duramen, which is impregnated with fragrant molecules with the due course. Agarwood has gained worldwide popularity due to its high aromatic oil, fragrance, and pharmaceutical value, which makes it highly solicited by numerous industries. Predominant chemical constituents of agarwood, sesquiterpenoids, and 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones have been scrutinized to comprehend the scientific nature of the fragrant wood and develop novel products. However, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of these aromatic compounds are still not comprehensively studied in Aquilaria. In this study, publicly available genomic and transcriptomics data of Aquilaria agallochum were integrated to identify putative functional terpene synthase genes (TPSs). The in silico study enabled us to identify ninety-six TPSs, of which thirty-nine full-length genes were systematically classified into TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, TPS-e, TPS-f, and TPS-g subfamilies based on their gene structure, conserve motif, and phylogenetic comparison with TPSs from other plant species. Analysis of the cis-regulatory elements present upstream of AaTPSs revealed their association with hormone, stress and light responses.

220,Herbivore-Induced Plant Volatiles to Enhance Biological Control in Agriculture,"Plants under herbivore attack synthetize defensive organic compounds that directly or indirectly affect herbivore performance and mediate other interactions with the community. The so-called herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) consist of odors released by attacked plants that serve as important cues for parasitoids and predators to locate their host/prey. The understanding that has been gained on the ecological role and mechanisms of HIPV emission opens up paths for developing novel strategies integrated with biological control programs with the aim of enhancing the efficacy of natural enemies in suppressing pest populations in crops. Tactics using synthetic HIPVs or chemically/genetically manipulating plant defenses have been suggested in order to recruit natural enemies to plantations or help guiding them to their host more quickly, working as a “synergistic” agent of biological control. This review discusses strategies using HIPVs to enhance biological control that have been proposed in the literature and were categorized here as: (a) exogenous application of elicitors on plants, (b) use of plant varieties that emit attractive HIPVs to natural enemies, (c) release of synthetic HIPVs, and (d) genetic manipulation targeting genes that optimize HIPV emission. We discuss the feasibility, benefits, and downsides of each strategy by considering not only field studies but also comprehensive laboratory assays that present an applied approach for HIPVs or show the potential of employing them in the field.",plants herbivore attack synthetize defensive organic compound directly indirectly affect herbivore performance mediate interaction community the called herbivore induced plant volatile hipvs consist odor released attacked plant serve important cue parasitoids predator locate host prey the understanding gained ecological role mechanism hipv emission open path developing novel strategy integrated biological control program aim enhancing efficacy natural enemy suppressing pest population crop tactics using synthetic hipvs chemically genetically manipulating plant defense suggested order recruit natural enemy plantation help guiding host quickly working synergistic agent biological control this review discus strategy using hipvs enhance biological control proposed literature categorized exogenous application elicitors plant b use plant variety emit attractive hipvs natural enemy c release synthetic hipvs genetic manipulation targeting gene optimize hipv emission we discus feasibility benefit downside strategy considering field study also comprehensive laboratory assay present applied approach hipvs show potential employing field,low
221,"Herbivore-induced terpenoid emission in Medicago truncatula: concerted action of jasmonate, ethylene and calcium signaling","Plant volatiles emitted by Medicago truncatula in response to feeding larvae of Spodoptera exigua are composed of a complex blend of terpenoids. The cDNAs of three terpene synthases (TPSs), which contribute to the blend of terpenoids, were cloned from M. truncatula. Their functional characterization proved MtTPS1 to be a ß-caryophyllene synthase and MtTPS5 to be a multi-product sesquiterpene synthase. MtTPS3 encodes a bifunctional enzyme producing (E)-nerolidol and geranyllinalool (precursors of C11 and C16 homoterpenes) from different prenyl diphosphates serving as substrates. The addition of jasmonic acid (JA) induced expression of the TPS genes, but terpenoid emission was higher from plants treated with JA and the ethylene precursor 1-amino-cyclopropyl-1-carboxylic acid. Compared to infested wild-type M. truncatula plants, lower amounts of various sesquiterpenes and a C11–homoterpene were released from an ethylene-insensitive mutant skl. This difference coincided with lower transcript levels of MtTPS5 and of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (MtDXS2) in the damaged skl leaves. Moreover, ethephon, an ethylene-releasing compound, modified the extent and mode of the herbivore-stimulated Ca2+ variations in the cytoplasm that is necessary for both JA and terpene biosynthesis. Thus, ethylene contributes to the herbivory-induced terpenoid biosynthesis at least twice: by modulating both early signaling events such as cytoplasmic Ca2+-influx and the downstream JA-dependent biosynthesis of terpenoids.",plant volatile emitted medicago truncatula response feeding larva spodoptera exigua composed complex blend terpenoids the cdnas three terpene synthases tpss contribute blend terpenoids cloned m truncatula their functional characterization proved mttps caryophyllene synthase mttps multi product sesquiterpene synthase mttps encodes bifunctional enzyme producing e nerolidol geranyllinalool precursor c c homoterpenes different prenyl diphosphates serving substrate the addition jasmonic acid ja induced expression tps gene terpenoid emission higher plant treated ja ethylene precursor amino cyclopropyl carboxylic acid compared infested wild type m truncatula plant lower amount various sesquiterpenes c homoterpene released ethylene insensitive mutant skl this difference coincided lower transcript level mttps deoxy d xylulose phosphate synthase mtdxs damaged skl leaf moreover ethephon ethylene releasing compound modified extent mode herbivore stimulated ca variation cytoplasm necessary ja terpene biosynthesis thus ethylene contributes herbivory induced terpenoid biosynthesis least twice modulating early signaling event cytoplasmic ca influx downstream ja dependent biosynthesis terpenoids,low

228,Insight into the mechanisms of enhanced production of valuable terpenoids by arbuscular mycorrhiza,"
Terpenoids, in addition to being essential for plant growth and survival, are commercially valued for their medicinal properties, ecological significance, and used as flavors and fragrances. Prospective role of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis in improving the accumulation of secondary metabolites especially terpenoids has gained recognition over the past two decades. Increased production of terpenoids in aboveground parts of AM-colonized medicinal plants has extensively been described. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning increase in accumulation of specific terpenoids in AM plants is important for obtaining higher yield and to improve the potential of AM in sustainable cultivation of plants harboring these compounds. Enhanced phosphorus uptake in the mycorrhizal plants has been largely credited for the increase in terpenoid production. However, recent findings have suggested AM mediated manipulation of morphology, biochemistry and gene transcription in plants. The review provides an update on recent findings in the field of AM research with a special focus on production of pharmaceutically important terpenoids.

229,Introduction to the Different Classes of Biosynthetic Enzymes,"Plant natural products are intimately associated with traits such as quality, yield, disease resistance, stress tolerance, color, and fragrance, in addition to being important dietary components and phytomedicines. In spite of the apparent complexity of natural product biosynthesis, much of the rich chemical diversity of the plant kingdom arises from a limited number of chemical scaffold types, modified by specific chemical substitutions such as hydroxylation, glycosylation, acylation, prenylation, and O-methylation. The molecular genetic basis underlying plant natural product chemistry has recently been the subject of concerted genomic and genetic approaches, facilitated by the fact that many of the key enzymatic steps in scaffold formation and substitution are catalyzed by proteins originating from recognizable gene families (e.g. polyketide synthase, glucosyltransferase) that have undergone significant expansion throughout plant evolution.

These products are commonly termed “secondary metabolites” in contrast to the “primary metabolites” which are essential for plant growth and development. Secondary metabolites were formerly regarded as “waste products” without physiological function for the plant. With the emergence of the field of chemical ecology about 30 years ago, it became evident, however, that these natural products fulfill important functions in the interaction between plants and their biotic and abiotic environment. They can serve, for example, as defense compounds against herbivores and pathogens, as flower pigments that attract pollinators, or as hormones or signal molecules. In addition to their physiological function in plants, natural products also have a strong impact on human culture and have been used throughout human history as condiments, pigments, and pharma­ceuticals.",plants produce enormous variety natural product highly diverse structure these product commonly termed secondary metabolite contrast primary metabolite essential plant growth development secondary metabolite formerly regarded waste product without physiological function plant with emergence field chemical ecology year ago became evident however natural product fulfill important function interaction plant biotic abiotic environment they serve example defense compound herbivore pathogen flower pigment attract pollinator hormone signal molecule in addition physiological function plant natural product also strong impact human culture used throughout human history condiment pigment pharma ceuticals,medium

232,Sandalwood Fragrance Pathway and Its Engineering for Sustainable Production of High-Value Santalols,"The essential oil extracted from the Santalum genus, known as sandalwood oil is one of the most valuable plant-derived secondary metabolites. It is obtained from the steam distillation of the heartwood of the sandalwood tree. The high value of this oil mainly stems from the limited supply, caused by difficulties in the cultivation of the plant and other socio-economic conditions. All species of the Santalum genus, including the highest oil-producing Santalum album (east Indian sandalwood), are very slow-growing that takes about 15–20 years to form heartwood from which oil is distilled. Combined with the loss of cultivatable land and poaching of wild trees make sandalwood oil very valuable. This oil has seen various applications in the aroma, perfume, cosmetic, flavor, and pharmaceutical industries. Though the essential oil of sandalwood constitutes several terpenes and terpene alcohols, the main fragrance-defining constituents of the oil are sesquiterpene alcohols (Z)-a-santalol, (Z)-ß-santalol, (Z)-epi-ß-santalol, and (Z)-a-exo-bergamotol, which are derived from their corresponding sesquiterpenes. In this chapter, we summarise the biosynthetic pathways involved in the formation of terpenoids and genes involved in the formation of key constituents of sandalwood essential oil.

To improve our knowledge about the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes and pyrethrin I, we directed a survey to analyze the gene expression in different developmental stages of leaves and also in chloroform dipped leaves (to remove glandular trichomes). Along with this, histochemical experiments were carried out on leaves to detect the accumulation site of lipids, monoterpene phenols, and sesquiterpenes. Gene expression results showed that chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDS), and 13-Lipoxygenase (13-LOX) putative genes were highly expressed in intact leaves (leaves with glandular trichomes).

237,"Secondary Metabolites: Secondary Metabolic Products Consisting of C and H; C, H, and O; N, S, and P Elements; and O/N Heterocycles","Terpenes and terpenoids, steroids and sterols, volatile oils, miscellaneous isoprenoids, phenols and phenyl propanoids, alkaloids, glycosides, bitter principles, resins, saponins, cardioactive compounds, etc., are important groups of secondary metabolites of plant origin. Terpenes and terpenoids are naturally occurring hydrocarbons, and ~2000 plant species of 60 families produce more than 55,000 terpenes and their derivatives. Terpenes are built from isoprene monomer (C5H8), and (C5H8)n. is the basic molecular formula. The oxygen-containing terpenes are called terpenoids or isoprenoids while steroids are cyclic terpenoids, and sterols are steroid alcohols. Terpenoids have significant importance in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industry. Terpenoids contribute to plant essential oils (eucalyptus, lavender, thyme, and mint), flavors (cinnamon, cloves, and ginger), color (yellow—sunflowers, red—tomatoes), etc. They protect plant against predators and pests (e.g., from herbivores, insects, fungi, microorganisms, etc.), aid to pollination and dispersal of spores, and in living organisms function range from pigments and fragrances to vitamins and precursors of sex hormones. Plant sterols, including campesterol, inhibit the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines and thereby reduce LDLs or cholesterol level. Phenols or phenolics are a class of chemical compounds with a benzene nucleus supporting a hydroxyl group and range from simple substances like phenolic acids or phenols, cumarines, flavonoids, and quinines to very complex ones such as lignins and tannins. Phenol and its chemical derivatives are used in the production of detergents, phenoxy herbicides, numerous pharmaceutical drugs, and many industrial synthetic goods. Alkaloids are cyclic bitter organic compounds containing nitrogen in a negative state of oxidation having a marked physiological action on man and other animals. A large variety of organisms produce alkaloids, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Alkaloids like caffeine, ephedrine, codeine, colchicine, nicotine, pilocarpine, opium, quinine, reserpine, cocaine, psilocin morphine, atropine, berberine, vincristine, yohimbine, etc., are some common examples of drugs principles of pharmaceutical importance and often are used as recreational drugs, or in entheogenic rituals. A glycoside is a heteromolecule consisting of a non-sugar (aglycone) and a sugar part (glycone) components. The glycone may be monosaccharide or oligosaccharide, and the aglycone may be an alcohol, anthraquinone derivative, phenol, aldehyde, acid, ester, or another compound. Glycosides play numerous important roles in living organisms, and many such plant glycosides are used as medications, e.g., the active principles of digitalis, strophanthus, cascara, willow, and poplar barks are being among the most valued remedies. The bitter principles are mostly terpenoid, especially the sesquiterpene lactones, monoterpene iridoids, and the secoiridoids. Diterpene bitters are found in columbo root and white horehound, and triterpenoids are the cause of bitterness in Cucurbitaceous plants, which is due to cucurbitacins. Plant lignans are diphenolic compounds (phenylpropanoids dimers) whose structure is the union of two units of phenylpropane. Tannins are non-nitrogenous bitter plant polyphenolic compounds having a molecular weight between 500 and 3000 (gallic acid esters) and up to 20,000 (proanthocyanidins). They are non-crystallisable colloidal compounds and may be (i) hydrolyzable tannins, which consist of gallic acid or related polyhydric compounds esterified with glucose, and they are readily hydrolysed to yield the phenolic acids and the sugar; and (ii) non-hydrolyzable or condensed tannins contain only phenolic nuclei and most of such tannins are formed by the condensation of two or more flavanols, such as catechin. Pharmaceutically, tannins have antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic, astringent, and antiseptic properties, and may be used in the treatment of hemorrhages (constrict of blood vessels), burns (cicatrizing), diarrhea, and as an antidote for alkaloid poisoning because of their ability to precipitate alkaloids; effective against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced toxicity and also have anti-inflammatory and antiulcer activity. Quinones are cyclic organic compounds (aromatic diketones) and are found in bacteria, in certain fungi, in various higher plant forms, and in a few animals (e.g., sea urchins, aphids, lac insects, and certain scale insects). It is highly active anti-microbacterial, antifungal agent and highly toxic and fatal if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin and widely used in medicine, herbicides, chemical reagents, dyes, and tanning agents. Saponins are amphiphilic glucoside molecules composed of hydrophilic glycoside glycone and lipophilic triterpene or steroid aglycone. Saponins have been used in medicine, foaming agents, in fire extinguishers, and fish poisons. Drugs that influence heart or drugs having an influence on the heart are cardioactive drugs. (i) Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, (ii) calcium channel blocking drugs, and (iii) cardiac glycosides are three major classes of cardioactive drugs. Cardiac glycosides are also important in the pathogenesis and therapy of different human diseases (e.g., stroke, diabetes, neurological diseases, cancer, etc.). Cardioactive steroids are a class of animal and plant-derived compounds with a steroid nucleus and a specific inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effect. Cardioactive steroids (CAS) became the mainstay of treatment for congestive heart failure and to control the ventricular response rate in atrial tachydysrhythmias. Antibiotics are produced by different groups of microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes and in many cases by higher plants. Antibiotics in low concentration are capable of inhibiting the growth of microorganisms through an antimetabolic mechanism. They differ from antiseptics and disinfectants in their mode of action, chemical, and physical properties. The development of resistance among the microorganisms on prolonged contact with the drug is the present-day problems in the field of antibiotics. The microbial and plant sources from the terrestrial and marine environments are now providing natural products with antitumor activity.

239,Structural and biochemical perspectives in plant isoprenoid biosynthesis,"The isoprenoid family represents one of the most ancient and widespread classes of structurally and functionally rich biomolecules known to man. Although these natural products are synthesized in all organisms, the plant kingdom exhibits tremendous variation in their chemistry and roles, ranging from primary metabolism to secondary metabolism and specialized ecological interactions with the environment. Despite enormous diversity in structure and function, all isoprenoids are derived from the universal C5 precursor isoprene. The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway has three major stages, viz., (1) synthesis of the isoprene building blocks, followed by their (2) assembly into flexible linear and branched hydrocarbon substrates, which then undergo (3) multistep reaction cascades to generate the vast assortment of isoprenoid end products. One of the most interesting aspects of isoprenoid biosynthesis is its being finely tuned by a multilayered and complex regulatory network, which excellently controls the machinery producing one of the most heterogeneous groups of molecules in plants. Terpene synthases, enzymes of the final stage, are key players in the generation of isoprenoid diversity, catalyzing one of the most complex reactions known to chemistry and biology. Unraveling the mechanism by which a minimal pool of substrates is thus converted into tens of thousands of regiospecific and stereospecific products, is a promising research avenue: This knowledge may be practically used for rational design of novel compounds by metabolic engineering, in order to yield plants with improved nutritional efficacy, stress resistance, bio-pharmaceutical properties etc. This review is an attempt to summarize the biochemical, molecular, physiological, structural, genomic and evolutionary aspects of isoprenoid biosynthesis, providing new insights into how these enzymes utilize various innovative strategies for creation of the so-called final terpenome.",the isoprenoid family represents one ancient widespread class structurally functionally rich biomolecules known man although natural product synthesized organism plant kingdom exhibit tremendous variation chemistry role ranging primary metabolism secondary metabolism specialized ecological interaction environment despite enormous diversity structure function isoprenoids derived universal c precursor isoprene the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway three major stage viz synthesis isoprene building block followed assembly flexible linear branched hydrocarbon substrate undergo multistep reaction cascade generate vast assortment isoprenoid end product one interesting aspect isoprenoid biosynthesis finely tuned multilayered complex regulatory network excellently control machinery producing one heterogeneous group molecule plant terpene synthases enzyme final stage key player generation isoprenoid diversity catalyzing one complex reaction known chemistry biology unraveling mechanism minimal pool substrate thus converted ten thousand regiospecific stereospecific product promising research avenue this knowledge may practically used rational design novel compound metabolic engineering order yield plant improved nutritional efficacy stress resistance bio pharmaceutical property etc this review attempt summarize biochemical molecular physiological structural genomic evolutionary aspect isoprenoid biosynthesis providing new insight enzyme utilize various innovative strategy creation called final terpenome,low
240,Synthetic Biology Advances for Enrichment of Bioactive Molecules in Plants,"Plant bioactive molecules are secondary metabolites that have pharmacological effects on human beings. Three types of secondary metabolites are present in plant systems: terpenes, alkaloids, and phenylpropanoids. They may not be very crucial for plant growth and development aspects, but are needful for survivability and fecundity. These pharmaceutical molecules are useful in the development of drug and other herbal preparations of potential health benefits. These phytomedicines are known to exert minimal side effects and enormous positive effectiveness to human health; therefore, their utility is enhancing day by day. Currently, many drug formulations contain plant bioactive molecules as a sole ingredient, covering more than 50% of the medicine-market. Despite the demand of secondary metabolites in the market, their supply is limited from the natural sources; therefore, technologies are required to enhance their production. Although advance breeding and biotechnological tools are being applied to enhance the biosynthetic level of bioactive molecules, synthetic biology offers a promising approach for production of these metabolites at substantial scale. Synthetic biology is a branch of biology and engineering, useful in designing and constructing modulated metabolic pathways and bioengineering of biological systems for the production of bioactive molecules. This chapter discusses about the plant bioactive molecules, their types, biosynthetic pathways, and significance. The molecular biology approaches used for production of the secondary metabolites have been summarized in this chapter.

241,Temporal Dynamics of Plant Volatiles: Mechanistic Bases and Functional Consequences,"Plant volatiles comprise thousands of low-molecular weight, hydrophobic molecules that are classified as ‘secondary’ (specialized) metabolites, but are closely related to ‘primary’ (general) metabolites such as fatty acids, amino acids, sterols and carotenoids. In addition to having important physiological functions, these specialized small molecules have a large influence on plants’ ecological interactions. By emitting particular blends of volatiles, plants can provide detailed information about their current physiological and ecological states and even manipulate other organisms. In fact, the timing of volatile biosynthesis and emission may be as critical to function as the amount and composition of volatile blends.

To explore this chemo-diversity, we initially carried out metabolite profiling of different tissues of five Ocimum species and identified the major terpenes. This analysis broadly classified these five Ocimum species into two distinct chemotypes namely, phenylpropanoid-rich and terpene-rich. In particular, ß-caryophyllene, myrcene, limonene, camphor, borneol and selinene were major terpenes present in these Ocimum species. Subsequently, transcriptomic analysis of pooled RNA samples from different tissues of Ocimum gratissimum, O. tenuiflorum and O. kilimandscharicum identified 38 unique transcripts of terpene synthase (TPS) gene family. Full-length gene cloning, followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of three TPS transcripts were carried out along with their expression in various tissues. Terpenoid metabolite and expression profiling of candidate TPS genes in various tissues of Ocimum species revealed spatial variances. Further, putative TPS contig 19414 (TPS1) was selected to corroborate its role in terpene biosynthesis. Agrobacterium-mediated transient over-expression assay of TPS1 in the leaves of O. kilimandscharicum and subsequent metabolic and gene expression analyses indicated it as a cis-ß-terpineol synthase.

244,Terpenes and Terpenoids,"Terpenes and their derivatives, the terpenoids, are synthetized from a five carbon atom isoprene unit. These units are added to each other to give rise to compounds of different complexities. The synthesis takes place either in the cytosol (MVA pathway) or within the plastids (MEP pathway). Monoterpenes, diterpenes and tetraterpenes are products from the MEP pathway, whereas sesquiterpenes, sterols and triterpenes are derivatives from the MVA pathway. Tailoring enzymes leads to the variations observed. End products are important for plant growth such as hormones (gibberellin and brassinosteroids) or carotenoids. They can be simpler structures, which are sometimes also volatile (such as menthol or ß-caryophyllene) or more complex, even polycyclic (such as ryanodine or stigmasterol).",terpenes derivative terpenoids synthetized five carbon atom isoprene unit these unit added give rise compound different complexity the synthesis take place either cytosol mva pathway within plastid mep pathway monoterpenes diterpenes tetraterpenes product mep pathway whereas sesquiterpenes sterol triterpenes derivative mva pathway tailoring enzyme lead variation observed end product important plant growth hormone gibberellin brassinosteroids carotenoid they simpler structure sometimes also volatile menthol caryophyllene complex even polycyclic ryanodine stigmasterol,low
245,The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Volatile Messengers in Trees,"All tree species possess genes encoding terminal enzymes responsible for volatile isoprenoid synthesis. However, only in some species, these genes are expressed constitutively in leaves, while terpenoid emissions can be triggered by abiotic and biotic stress factor in essentially all species. This chapter analyses the biochemical diversity of volatile isoprenoid synthases and investigates the genomic modifications responsible for constitutive volatile production in trees. Plant terpenoids are up to three-domain proteins with either one active center in monofunctional synthases, or two active centers in bifunctional synthases. There is evidence of monophyletic origin of modern plant terpenoid synthases from a three-domain synthase in an ancient progenitor followed by extensive gene duplication and domain loss. The terpenoid synthase sequence similarity can be low among distant plant groups, but terpenoid tertiary structure is remarkably similar in different synthases, and this structural similarity is even conserved across domains of life. However, only minor changes in active center structure can lead to major changes in product profiles, indicating that presence of rich terpenoid genetic diversity constitutes an important means for rapid evolutionary adaptations to novel biotic interactions, and to new abiotic stresses in plant habitats.",all tree specie posse gene encoding terminal enzyme responsible volatile isoprenoid synthesis however specie gene expressed constitutively leaf terpenoid emission triggered abiotic biotic stress factor essentially specie this chapter analysis biochemical diversity volatile isoprenoid synthases investigates genomic modification responsible constitutive volatile production tree plant terpenoids three domain protein either one active center monofunctional synthases two active center bifunctional synthases there evidence monophyletic origin modern plant terpenoid synthases three domain synthase ancient progenitor followed extensive gene duplication domain loss the terpenoid synthase sequence similarity low among distant plant group terpenoid tertiary structure remarkably similar different synthases structural similarity even conserved across domain life however minor change active center structure lead major change product profile indicating presence rich terpenoid genetic diversity constitutes important mean rapid evolutionary adaptation novel biotic interaction new abiotic stress plant habitat,low

247,The Impact of Induced Plant Volatiles on Plant-Arthropod Interactions,"Plants release volatile organic compounds from their vegetative tissues into their environment during most of their life cycle. The functions of these volatiles are diverse and not always known but some of these volatiles repel foraging herbivores while others, in turn, attract them and are feeding stimuli. Upon herbivory the amount of volatiles increases dramatically while, simultaneously, also the composition of the blend changes thereby enhancing the attractiveness of the plant to foraging natural enemies and in some cases increasing repellency to herbivores. Hence, herbivore-induced volatiles promote a natural form of biological pest control referred to as “indirect plant defense” and it has often been suggested that this phenomenon could be exploited to enhance crop protection. Here we will introduce the concept of indirect plant defense via volatiles and via other means and outline the current state of knowledge to the extent in which it contributes to protecting a plant to maximize its fitness under natural conditions in an evolutionary and ecological context. Moreover we will summarize the different approaches that have been undertaken to manipulate indirect defenses, either via application of synthetic volatiles or via transgenic manipulation of plant-volatile production, to control the movements of foraging arthropods to improve biological control. Finally, we will discuss to which extent IPM can be improved or even be disrupted via manipulation of plant volatiles.",plants release volatile organic compound vegetative tissue environment life cycle the function volatile diverse always known volatile repel foraging herbivore others turn attract feeding stimulus upon herbivory amount volatile increase dramatically simultaneously also composition blend change thereby enhancing attractiveness plant foraging natural enemy case increasing repellency herbivore hence herbivore induced volatile promote natural form biological pest control referred indirect plant defense often suggested phenomenon could exploited enhance crop protection here introduce concept indirect plant defense via volatile via mean outline current state knowledge extent contributes protecting plant maximize fitness natural condition evolutionary ecological context moreover summarize different approach undertaken manipulate indirect defense either via application synthetic volatile via transgenic manipulation plant volatile production control movement foraging arthropod improve biological control finally discus extent ipm improved even disrupted via manipulation plant volatile,medium
248,The molecular and biochemical basis for varietal variation in sesquiterpene content in melon (Cucumis melo L.) rinds,"A combined chemical, biochemical and molecular study was conducted to understand the differential accumulation of volatile sesquiterpenes in melon fruits. Sesquiterpenes were present mainly in the rinds of climacteric varieties, and a great diversity in their composition was found among varieties. Sesquiterpenes were generally absent in non-climacteric varieties. Two climacteric melon varieties, the green-fleshed ‘Noy Yizre'el’, and the orange-fleshed ‘Dulce’ were further examined. In ‘Noy Yizre'el’ the main sesquiterpenes accumulated are d-cadinene, ?-cadinene and a-copaene, while a-farnesene is the main sesquiterpene in ‘Dulce’. Sesquiterpene synthase activities, mainly restricted to rinds of mature fruits, were shown to generate different sesquiterpenes in each variety according to the compositions found in rinds. EST melon database mining yielded two novel cDNAs coding for members of the Tps gene family termed CmTpsNY and CmTpsDul respectively, that are 43.2% similar. Heterologous expression in E. coli of CmTpsNY produced mainly d-copaene, a-copaene, ß-caryophyllene, germacrene D, a-muurolene, ?-cadinene, d-cadinene, and a-cadinene, while CmTpsDul produced a-farnesene only. CmTpsNY was mostly expressed in ‘Noy Yizre'el’ rind while CmTpsDul expression was specific to ’Dulce’ rind. None of these genes was expressed in rinds of the non-climacteric ‘Tam Dew’ cultivar. Our results indicate that different sesquiterpene synthases encoded by different members of the Tps gene family are active in melon varieties and this specificity modulates the accumulation of sesquiterpenes. The genes are differentially transcriptionally regulated during fruit development and according to variety and are likely to be associated with chemical differences responsible for the unique aromas of melon varieties.",a combined chemical biochemical molecular study conducted understand differential accumulation volatile sesquiterpenes melon fruit sesquiterpenes present mainly rind climacteric variety great diversity composition found among variety sesquiterpenes generally absent non climacteric variety two climacteric melon variety green fleshed noy yizre el orange fleshed dulce examined in noy yizre el main sesquiterpenes accumulated cadinene cadinene copaene farnesene main sesquiterpene dulce sesquiterpene synthase activity mainly restricted rind mature fruit shown generate different sesquiterpenes variety according composition found rind est melon database mining yielded two novel cdnas coding member tps gene family termed cmtpsny cmtpsdul respectively similar heterologous expression e coli cmtpsny produced mainly copaene copaene caryophyllene germacrene d muurolene cadinene cadinene cadinene cmtpsdul produced farnesene cmtpsny mostly expressed noy yizre el rind cmtpsdul expression specific dulce rind none gene expressed rind non climacteric tam dew cultivar our result indicate different sesquiterpene synthases encoded different member tps gene family active melon variety specificity modulates accumulation sesquiterpenes the gene differentially transcriptionally regulated fruit development according variety likely associated chemical difference responsible unique aroma melon variety,low
249,"The Phytochemical Composition, Biological Effects and Biotechnological Approaches to the Production of High-Value Essential Oil from Geranium","Geraniaceae family plants are highly reputed aromatic and medicinal perennial branched herbs.

251,The transcriptome of flower development provides insight into floral scent formation in Freesia hybrida,"Freesia hybrida is a popular cut flower that is globally cultivated. Despite fragrance being an important floral trait, little is known of its associated molecular mechanisms in F. hybrida. In this study, cDNA libraries were constructed for three floral developmental stages in F. hybrida. A total of 74,660 unigenes were obtained from RNA sequencing and de novo assembly, of which 72.20% were annotated by seven public protein databases. Approximately 12,420 differentially expressed genes were identified during flower development.

252,Therapeutic and Medicinal Uses of Terpenes,"Terpenes, also known as terpenoids are the largest and most diverse group of naturally occurring compounds. Based on the number of isoprene units they have, they are classified as mono, di, tri, tetra, and sesquiterpenes. They are mostly found in plants and form the major constituent of essential oils from plants. Among the natural products that provide medical benefits for an organism, terpenes play a major and variety of roles. The common plant sources of terpenes are tea, thyme, cannabis, Spanish sage, and citrus fruits (e.g., lemon, orange, mandarin). Terpenes have a wide range of medicinal uses among which antiplasmodial activity is notable as its mechanism of action is similar to the popular antimalarial drug in use—chloroquine. Monoterpenes specifically are widely studied for their antiviral property. With growing incidents of cancer and diabetes in modern world, terpenes also have the potential to serve as anticancer and antidiabetic reagents. Along with these properties, terpenes also allow for flexibility in route of administration and suppression of side effects. Certain terpenes were widely used in natural folk medicine. One such terpene is curcumin which holds anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, antiplasmodial, astringent, digestive, diuretic, and many other properties. Curcumin has also become a recent trend in healthy foods and open doors for several medical researches. This chapter summarizes the various terpenes, their sources, medicinal properties, mechanism of action, and the recent studies that are underway for designing terpenes as a lead molecule in the modern medicine.",terpenes also known terpenoids largest diverse group naturally occurring compound based number isoprene unit classified mono di tri tetra sesquiterpenes they mostly found plant form major constituent essential oil plant among natural product provide medical benefit organism terpene play major variety role the common plant source terpene tea thyme cannabis spanish sage citrus fruit e g lemon orange mandarin terpenes wide range medicinal us among antiplasmodial activity notable mechanism action similar popular antimalarial drug use chloroquine monoterpenes specifically widely studied antiviral property with growing incident cancer diabetes modern world terpene also potential serve anticancer antidiabetic reagent along property terpene also allow flexibility route administration suppression side effect certain terpene widely used natural folk medicine one terpene curcumin hold anti inflammatory antioxidant anticancer antiseptic antiplasmodial astringent digestive diuretic many property curcumin also become recent trend healthy food open door several medical research this chapter summarizes various terpene source medicinal property mechanism action recent study underway designing terpene lead molecule modern medicine,medium
253,Tomato linalool synthase is induced in trichomes by jasmonic acid,"Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants emit a blend of volatile organic compounds, which mainly consists of terpenes. Upon herbivory or wounding, the emission of several terpenes increases. We have identified and characterized the first two tomato monoterpene synthases, LeMTS1 and LeMTS2. Although these proteins were highly homologous, recombinant LeMTS1 protein produced (R)-linalool from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (E)-nerolidol from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), while recombinant LeMTS2 produced ß-phellandrene, ß-myrcene, and sabinene from GPP. In addition, these genes were expressed in different tissues: LeMTS1 was expressed in flowers, young leaves, stems, and petioles, while LeMTS2 was strongest expressed in stems and roots. LeMTS1 expression in leaves was induced by spider mite-infestation, wounding and jasmonic acid (JA)-treatment, while LeMTS2 did not respond to these stimuli. The expression of LeMTS1 in stems and petioles was predominantly detected in trichomes and could be induced by JA. Because JA treatment strongly induced emission of linalool and overexpression of LeMTS1 in tomato resulted in increased production of linalool, we propose that LeMTS1 is a genuine linalool synthase. Our results underline the importance of trichomes in JA-induced terpene emission in tomato.",tomato lycopersicon esculentum plant emit blend volatile organic compound mainly consists terpene upon herbivory wounding emission several terpene increase we identified characterized first two tomato monoterpene synthases lemts lemts although protein highly homologous recombinant lemts protein produced r linalool geranyl diphosphate gpp e nerolidol farnesyl diphosphate fpp recombinant lemts produced phellandrene myrcene sabinene gpp in addition gene expressed different tissue lemts expressed flower young leaf stem petiole lemts strongest expressed stem root lemts expression leaf induced spider mite infestation wounding jasmonic acid ja treatment lemts respond stimulus the expression lemts stem petiole predominantly detected trichomes could induced ja because ja treatment strongly induced emission linalool overexpression lemts tomato resulted increased production linalool propose lemts genuine linalool synthase our result underline importance trichomes ja induced terpene emission tomato,low
254,Toward a photosynthetic microbial platform for terpenoid engineering,"Plant terpenoids are among the most diverse group of naturally-occurring organic compounds known, and several are used in contemporary consumer products. Terpene synthase enzymes catalyze complex rearrangements of carbon skeleton precursors to yield thousands of unique chemical structures that range in size from the simplest five carbon isoprene unit to the long polymers of rubber. Such chemical diversity has established plant terpenoids as valuable commodity chemicals with applications in the pharmaceutical, neutraceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. More recently, terpenoids have received attention as a renewable alternative to petroleum-derived fuels and as the building blocks of synthetic biopolymers. However, the current plant- and petrochemical-based supplies of commodity terpenoids have major limitations. Photosynthetic microorganisms provide an opportunity to generate terpenoids in a renewable manner, employing a single consolidated host organism that is able to use solar energy, H2O and CO2 as the primary inputs for terpenoid biosynthesis. Advances in synthetic biology have seen important breakthroughs in microbial terpenoid engineering, traditionally via fermentative pathways in yeast and Escherichia coli. This review draws on the knowledge obtained from heterotrophic microbial engineering to propose strategies for the development of microbial photosynthetic platforms for industrial terpenoid production.

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which acts as an effective elicitor among the plant kingdom, could mostly improve the quality of tea aroma by promoting flavor volatiles in tea leaves. Although a variety of volatile secondary metabolites that contribute to aroma quality have been identified, our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of these compounds has remained largely incomplete. Therefore, information aboaut the transcriptome of tea leaves and, specifically, details of any changes in gene expression in response to MeJA, is required for a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of MeJA-mediated volatiles biosynthesis. Moreover, MeJA treatment could exaggerate the responses of secondary metabolites and some gene expression which offer a better chance to figure out the mechanism.",tea camellia sinensis long consumed worldwide amazing flavor aroma methyl jasmonate meja act effective elicitor among plant kingdom could mostly improve quality tea aroma promoting flavor volatile tea leaf although variety volatile secondary metabolite contribute aroma quality identified understanding biosynthetic pathway compound remained largely incomplete therefore information aboaut transcriptome tea leaf specifically detail change gene expression response meja required better understanding biological mechanism meja mediated volatile biosynthesis moreover meja treatment could exaggerate response secondary metabolite gene expression offer better chance figure mechanism,low

257,Unravelling the functions of biogenic volatiles in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems,"Living trees are the main source of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) in forest ecosystems, but substantial emissions originate from leaf and wood litter, the rhizosphere and from microorganisms. This review focuses on temperate and boreal forest ecosystems and the roles of BVOCs in ecosystem function, from the leaf to the forest canopy and from the forest soil to the atmosphere level. Moreover, emphasis is given to the question of how BVOCs will help forests adapt to environmental stress, particularly biotic stress related to climate change. Trees use their vascular system and emissions of BVOCs in internal communication, but emitted BVOCs have extended the communication to tree population and whole community levels and beyond. Future forestry practices should consider the importance of BVOCs in attraction and repulsion of attacking bark beetles, but also take an advantage of herbivore-induced BVOCs to improve the efficiency of natural enemies of herbivores. BVOCs are extensively involved in ecosystem services provided by forests including the positive effects on human health. BVOCs have a key role in ozone formation but also in ozone quenching. Oxidation products form secondary organic aerosols that disperse sunlight deeper into the forest canopy, and affect cloud formation and ultimately the climate. We also discuss the technical side of reliable BVOC sampling of forest trees for future interdisciplinary studies that should bridge the gaps between the forest sciences, health sciences, chemical ecology, conservation biology, tree physiology and atmospheric science.",living tree main source biogenic volatile organic compound bvocs forest ecosystem substantial emission originate leaf wood litter rhizosphere microorganism this review focus temperate boreal forest ecosystem role bvocs ecosystem function leaf forest canopy forest soil atmosphere level moreover emphasis given question bvocs help forest adapt environmental stress particularly biotic stress related climate change trees use vascular system emission bvocs internal communication emitted bvocs extended communication tree population whole community level beyond future forestry practice consider importance bvocs attraction repulsion attacking bark beetle also take advantage herbivore induced bvocs improve efficiency natural enemy herbivore bvocs extensively involved ecosystem service provided forest including positive effect human health bvocs key role ozone formation also ozone quenching oxidation product form secondary organic aerosol disperse sunlight deeper forest canopy affect cloud formation ultimately climate we also discus technical side reliable bvoc sampling forest tree future interdisciplinary study bridge gap forest science health science chemical ecology conservation biology tree physiology atmospheric science,low
258,Use of cyclodextrins to improve the production of plant bioactive compounds,"Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of D-glucopyranose units bound via a-(1,4)-glycosidic linkages. They are obtained from starch enzymatic degradation by the action of cyclodextrinases or glycosyltransferases. Among the modified-cyclodextrins, 2-hydroxypropylated and methylated ß-cyclodextrins are produced on industrial scale. Particularly, methylated ß-cyclodextrins are more suitable than native ß-cyclodextrins to form stable inclusion complexes with organic molecules of low molecular weight, making these complexes more soluble in aqueous solutions. Cyclodextrins have often been considered useful carriers of antitumor- and immuno-regulatory drugs, and they have also been used as additives for food industry. It is also important to note that cyclodextrins are used for improving bioactive compound production in plant cell cultures because of cyclodextrins ability as “hosts” of bioactive compounds favoring their accumulation in aqueous media. In fact, the treatment of plant cell cultures with cyclodextrins and their derivatives increases the production of secondary metabolites such as resveratrol, ajmalicine, serpentine, lutein, arachidin, among other antioxidant compounds, enhancing the capability of plant in vitro cultures to produce high levels of different bioactive compounds which have beneficial properties for human health. In addition, metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies have been carried out on both control and cyclodextrins-treated cell cultures offering important clues about how cyclodextrins are capable of substantially increasing the production of bioactive compounds in plant in vitro cultures.

261,Volatiles Emission Patterns in Poplar Clones Varying in Response to Ozone,"The volatiles emitted from young and old leaves of two poplar clones (Populus deltoides x maximowiczii, Eridano, and P. x euramericana, I-214) were sampled after exposure to ozone (80 ppb, 5 h?d-1, for 10 consecutive days) by solid phase microextraction and characterized by GC-MS. Only mature leaves of the ozone-sensitive Eridano clone developed necrosis in response to ozone exposure, and their membrane integrity was significantly affected by ozone (+86 and +18 % of levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in mature and young leaves). The headspace of the poplar clones studied here contained mono- and sesquiterpenes, both hydrocarbons and oxygenated ones in Eridano, and only hydrocarbons in the clone I-214. Furthermore, some non-terpenes, such as C9-C15 straight-chain aldehydes and C12-C16 saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, were detected. Other common non-terpene volatiles were oxygenated aliphatic compounds, mainly C6-alcohols and their acetates. Ozone exposure induced a strong change in volatile profiles, depending on clones and leaf age. Regardless of leaf age, in clone I-214, quantities of oxygenated monoterpenes tended to increase after ozone exposure, however, “O3 x leaf age” was not significant. In clone Eridano, increases were observed in emissions of hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes in response to ozone treatment. (Z)-3-Hexen-1-ol and (Z)-3-hexenol acetate were present in traces in the headspace of untreated Eridano mature leaves, but quantities slightly increased after ozone treatment. Quantities of non-terpene oxygenated compounds dropped in the headspace of young leaves of both clones (-24 and -44 % in Eridano and I-214) and also in mature ones of I-214 (-50 %) after ozone exposure. Similarly, quantities of non-terpene hydrocarbons in the emissions from mature leaves of both clones (-58 and -49 %, respectively) decreased, while these compounds increased in young leaves of Eridano (+83 %). We suggest that the resistance of the poplar clone I-214 to O3 is achieved by: i) monoterpenes constitutively present in young leaves and ii) increase of monoterpene content induced by O3 in mature leaves.",the volatile emitted young old leaf two poplar clone populus deltoides x maximowiczii eridano p x euramericana i sampled exposure ozone ppb h consecutive day solid phase microextraction characterized gc ms only mature leaf ozone sensitive eridano clone developed necrosis response ozone exposure membrane integrity significantly affected ozone level thiobarbituric acid reactive substance mature young leaf the headspace poplar clone studied contained mono sesquiterpenes hydrocarbon oxygenated one eridano hydrocarbon clone i furthermore non terpene c c straight chain aldehyde c c saturated unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon detected other common non terpene volatile oxygenated aliphatic compound mainly c alcohol acetate ozone exposure induced strong change volatile profile depending clone leaf age regardless leaf age clone i quantity oxygenated monoterpenes tended increase ozone exposure however o x leaf age significant in clone eridano increase observed emission hydrocarbon oxygenated sesquiterpenes response ozone treatment z hexen ol z hexenol acetate present trace headspace untreated eridano mature leaf quantity slightly increased ozone treatment quantities non terpene oxygenated compound dropped headspace young leaf clone eridano i also mature one i ozone exposure similarly quantity non terpene hydrocarbon emission mature leaf clone respectively decreased compound increased young leaf eridano we suggest resistance poplar clone i o achieved monoterpenes constitutively present young leaf ii increase monoterpene content induced o mature leaf,low
262,What Are Plant-Released Biogenic Volatiles and How They Participate in Landscape- to Global-Level Processes?,"Plants face a multitude of abiotic and biotic stresses with varying severity throughout their life, and these stresses can result in varying changes to the ecosystem services provided by the plants. Climate change involves modification of several environmental drivers, and it is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of various abiotic and biotic stresses, including rising temperatures, increasingly uneven distribution of precipitation, and more frequent outbreaks of herbivore and pathogen attacks. As any stress reduces plant CO2 fixation, enhanced stress frequency and severity are expected to lead to faster rise of atmospheric CO2 concentration, thereby further exacerbating climate change. On the other hand, plants can importantly modify their own life environment by release of volatile organic compounds (BVOC). The plant-generated volatiles modify the oxidative status of the ambient atmosphere by enhancing the rate of ozone formation in atmospheres polluted by mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx). From this perspective, plant emissions can be considered as ecosystem “disservice.” Plant-emitted volatiles also importantly participate in aerosol and cloud formation in both polluted and non-polluted atmospheres, thereby reducing solar radiation penetration and ambient temperature. Plant-facilitated cooling can partly counteract global warming, and thus, plant emissions provide an important global regulatory ecosystem service. Apart from constitutive volatile emissions that are present in only some species and are expected to decrease under stress, especially under severe stress, all plants respond to stresses by inducing BVOC emissions that serve as signal molecules eliciting stress response pathways and leading to plant acclimation. These induced BVOC emissions, the plant “talk,” also contribute to atmospheric processes and can potentially reduce the stress severity, and, accordingly, stress-driven reductions in CO2 uptake. Thus, the stress responses and acclimation of vegetation to future environmental stresses can importantly modify the speed and magnitude of climate change.",plants face multitude abiotic biotic stress varying severity throughout life stress result varying change ecosystem service provided plant climate change involves modification several environmental driver predicted increase frequency severity various abiotic biotic stress including rising temperature increasingly uneven distribution precipitation frequent outbreak herbivore pathogen attack as stress reduces plant co fixation enhanced stress frequency severity expected lead faster rise atmospheric co concentration thereby exacerbating climate change on hand plant importantly modify life environment release volatile organic compound bvoc the plant generated volatile modify oxidative status ambient atmosphere enhancing rate ozone formation atmosphere polluted mono nitrogen oxide nox from perspective plant emission considered ecosystem disservice plant emitted volatile also importantly participate aerosol cloud formation polluted non polluted atmosphere thereby reducing solar radiation penetration ambient temperature plant facilitated cooling partly counteract global warming thus plant emission provide important global regulatory ecosystem service apart constitutive volatile emission present specie expected decrease stress especially severe stress plant respond stress inducing bvoc emission serve signal molecule eliciting stress response pathway leading plant acclimation these induced bvoc emission plant talk also contribute atmospheric process potentially reduce stress severity accordingly stress driven reduction co uptake thus stress response acclimation vegetation future environmental stress importantly modify speed magnitude climate change,low

265,Biosynthesis of essential oils in aromatic plants: A review,"In aromatic plants species, biosynthesis of essential oils occurs through two complex natural biochemical pathways involving different enzymatic reactions. Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) are the universal precursors of essential oil biosynthesis and are produced by the cytosolic enzymatic MVA (mevalonic acid) pathway or by plastidic and enzymatic 1-deoxy-d-xylolose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway, also called the 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. In the particular plant cell part, prenyl diphosphate synthases condense isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) further to form prenyl diphosphates, which are used as substrates for geranyl diphosphate (GPP; C10) or for fernesyl diphosphate (FPP; C15). Essential oils are final terpenoid products and are formed by a huge group of enzymes known as terpene synthases (TPS). Essential oils are important secondary metabolites of plants and have been used not only in different industries but also in ethnobotanical medicines for centuries. Hence, considerable research has been undertaken to understand the essential oil biosynthetic pathways.

Like some other genera of this family, many Chrysanthemum species are producers of high levels of secondary metabolites. This review focuses on the largest class of plant secondary metabolites, namely terpenoids produced by Chrysanthemum species. An extensive literature search revealed a total of 390 terpenoids from these species, which include 183 monoterpenoids and 207 sesquiterpenoids.

269,Metabolic engineering of sesquiterpene metabolism in yeast,"Terpenes are structurally diverse compounds that are of interest because of their biological activities and industrial value. These compounds consist of chirally rich hydrocarbon backbones derived from terpene synthases, which are subsequently decorated with hydroxyl substituents catalyzed by terpene hydroxylases. Availability of these compounds is, however, limited by intractable synthetic means and because they are produced in low amounts and as complex mixtures by natural sources. We engineered yeast for sesquiterpene accumulation by introducing genetic modifications that enable the yeast to accumulate high levels of the key intermediate farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Co-expression of terpene synthase genes diverted the enlarged FPP pool to greater than 80 mg/L of sesquiterpene. Efficient coupling of terpene production with hydroxylation was also demonstrated by coordinate expression of terpene hydroxylase activity, yielding 50 mg/L each of hydrocarbon and hydroxylated products. These yeast now provide a convenient format for investigating catalytic coupling between terpene synthases and hydroxylases, as well as a platform for the industrial production of high value, single-entity and stereochemically unique terpenes.

270,Metabolic engineering of volatile isoprenoids in plants and microbes,"The chemical properties and diversity of volatile isoprenoids lends them to a broad variety of biological roles. It also lends them to a host of biotechnological applications, both by taking advantage of their natural functions and by using them as industrial chemicals/chemical feedstocks. Natural functions include roles as insect attractants and repellents, abiotic stress protectants in pathogen defense, etc. Industrial applications include use as pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, fuels, fuel additives, etc. Here we will examine the ways in which researchers have so far found to exploit volatile isoprenoids using biotechnology. Production and/or modification of volatiles using metabolic engineering in both plants and microorganisms are reviewed, including engineering through both mevalonate and methylerythritol diphosphate pathways. Recent advances are illustrated using several case studies (herbivores and bodyguards, isoprene, and monoterpene production in microbes). Systems and synthetic biology tools with particular utility for metabolic engineering are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss the practical realities of various applications in modern biotechnology, explore possible future applications, and examine the challenges of moving these technologies forward so that they can deliver tangible benefits.

273,Moonlighting Metals: Insights into Regulation of Cyclization Pathways in Fungal ?6-Protoilludene Sesquiterpene Synthases,"Fungal 1,11 cyclizing sesquiterpene synthases are product specific under typical reaction conditions. However, in vivo expression of certain ?6-protoilludene synthases results in dual 1,11 and 1,10 cyclization. To determine the factors regulating this mechanistic variation, in-depth in vitro characterization of ?6-protoilludene synthases was conducted. Divalent metal ions determine cyclization specificity and this product variability. Promiscuity in metal binding is mediated by secondary metal-binding sites away from the conserved D(D/E)XX(D/E) motif in sesquiterpene synthases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a divergent evolution of Basidiomycota trans-humulyl cation producing sesquiterpene synthases, results that indicate a wider diversity in function than previously predicted.

274,Natural products – modifying metabolite pathways in plants,"The diversity of plant natural product (PNP) molecular structures is reflected in the variety of biochemical and genetic pathways that lead to their formation and accumulation. Plant secondary metabolites are important commodities, and include fragrances, colorants, and medicines. Increasing the extractable amount of PNP through plant breeding, or more recently by means of metabolic engineering, is a priority. The prerequisite for any attempt at metabolic engineering is a detailed knowledge of the underlying biosynthetic and regulatory pathways in plants. Over the past few decades, an enormous body of information about the biochemistry and genetics of biosynthetic pathways involved in PNPs production has been generated. In this review, we focus on the three large classes of plant secondary metabolites: terpenoids (or isoprenoids), phenylpropanoids, and alkaloids. All three provide excellent examples of the tremendous efforts undertaken to boost our understanding of biosynthetic pathways, resulting in the first successes in plant metabolic engineering.

275,Oak gall wasp infections of Quercus robur leaves lead to profound modifications in foliage photosynthetic and volatile emission characteristics,"Oak trees (Quercus) are hosts of diverse gall-inducing parasites, but the effects of gall formation on the physiology and biochemistry on host oak leaves is poorly understood. The influence of infection by four species from two widespread gall wasp genera, Neuroterus (N. anthracinus and N. albipes) and Cynips (C. divisa and C. quercusfolii), on foliage morphology, chemistry, photosynthetic characteristics, constitutive isoprene, and induced volatile emissions in Q. robur was investigated. Leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), net assimilation rate per area (AA), stomatal conductance (gs), and constitutive isoprene emissions decreased with the severity of infection by all gall wasp species. The reduction in AA was mainly determined by reduced MA and to a lower extent by lower content of leaf nitrogen and phosphorus in gall-infected leaves. The emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles increased strongly with increasing infection severity for all 4 species with the strongest emissions in major vein associated species, N. anthracinus. Monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions were strongly elicited in N. albipes and Cynips species, but not in N. anthracinus. These results provide valuable information for diagnosing oak infections using ambient air volatile fingerprints and for predicting the impacts of infections on photosynthetic productivity and whole tree performance.",oak tree quercus host diverse gall inducing parasite effect gall formation physiology biochemistry host oak leaf poorly understood the influence infection four specie two widespread gall wasp genus neuroterus n anthracinus n albipes cynips c divisa c quercusfolii foliage morphology chemistry photosynthetic characteristic constitutive isoprene induced volatile emission q robur investigated leaf dry mass per unit area ma net assimilation rate per area aa stomatal conductance g constitutive isoprene emission decreased severity infection gall wasp specie the reduction aa mainly determined reduced ma lower extent lower content leaf nitrogen phosphorus gall infected leaf the emission lipoxygenase pathway volatile increased strongly increasing infection severity specie strongest emission major vein associated specie n anthracinus monoterpene sesquiterpene emission strongly elicited n albipes cynips specie n anthracinus these result provide valuable information diagnosing oak infection using ambient air volatile fingerprint predicting impact infection photosynthetic productivity whole tree performance,medium
276,Plant Terpenoids: Biosynthesis and Ecological Functions,"Among plant secondary metabolites terpenoids are a structurally most diverse group; they function as phytoalex-ins in plant direct defense, or as signals in indirect defense responses which involves herbivores and their natural enemies. In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the investigation of the ecological role of plant terpenoids. The biosynthesis pathways of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes include the synthesis of C5 precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the synthesis of the immediate diphosphate precursors, and the formation of the diverse terpenoids. Terpene synthases (TPSs) play a key role in volatile terpene synthesis. By expression of the TPS genes, significant achievements have been made on metabolic engineering to increase terpenoid production. This review mainly summarizes the recent research progress in elucidating the ecological role of terpenoids and characterization of the enzymes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis.

277,Plant volatile-mediated signalling and its application in agriculture: successes and challenges,"The mediation of volatile secondary metabolites in signalling between plants and other organisms has long been seen as presenting opportunities for sustainable crop protection. Initially, exploitation of interactions between plants and other organisms, particularly insect pests, foundered because of difficulties in delivering, sustainably, the signal systems for crop protection. We now have mounting and, in some cases, clear practical evidence for successful delivery by companion cropping or next-generation genetic modification (GM). At the same time, the type of plant signalling being exploited has expanded to signalling from plants to organisms antagonistic to pests, and to plant stress-induced, or primed, plant-to-plant signalling for defence and growth stimulation.",the mediation volatile secondary metabolite signalling plant organism long seen presenting opportunity sustainable crop protection initially exploitation interaction plant organism particularly insect pest foundered difficulty delivering sustainably signal system crop protection we mounting case clear practical evidence successful delivery companion cropping next generation genetic modification gm at time type plant signalling exploited expanded signalling plant organism antagonistic pest plant stress induced primed plant plant signalling defence growth stimulation,low
278,Plant volatiles in extreme terrestrial and marine environments,"This review summarizes the current understanding on plant and algal volatile organic compound (VOC) production and emission in extreme environments, where temperature, water availability, salinity or other environmental factors pose stress on vegetation. Here, the extreme environments include terrestrial systems, such as arctic tundra, deserts, CO2 springs and wetlands, and marine systems such as sea ice, tidal rock pools and hypersaline environments, with mangroves and salt marshes at the land–sea interface. The emission potentials at fixed temperature and light level or actual emission rates for phototrophs in extreme environments are frequently higher than for organisms from less stressful environments. For example, plants from the arctic tundra appear to have higher emission potentials for isoprenoids than temperate species, and hypersaline marine habitats contribute to global dimethyl sulphide (DMS) emissions in significant amounts. DMS emissions are more widespread than previously considered, for example, in salt marshes and some desert plants. The reason for widespread VOC, especially isoprenoid, emissions from different extreme environments deserves further attention, as these compounds may have important roles in stress resistance and adaptation to extremes. Climate warming is likely to significantly increase VOC emissions from extreme environments both by direct effects on VOC production and volatility, and indirectly by altering the composition of the vegetation.",this review summarizes current understanding plant algal volatile organic compound voc production emission extreme environment temperature water availability salinity environmental factor pose stress vegetation here extreme environment include terrestrial system arctic tundra desert co spring wetland marine system sea ice tidal rock pool hypersaline environment mangrove salt marsh land sea interface the emission potential fixed temperature light level actual emission rate phototrophs extreme environment frequently higher organism le stressful environment for example plant arctic tundra appear higher emission potential isoprenoids temperate specie hypersaline marine habitat contribute global dimethyl sulphide dms emission significant amount dms emission widespread previously considered example salt marsh desert plant the reason widespread voc especially isoprenoid emission different extreme environment deserves attention compound may important role stress resistance adaptation extreme climate warming likely significantly increase voc emission extreme environment direct effect voc production volatility indirectly altering composition vegetation,low

In this study, three metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains were constructed for (-)-5-epieremophilene production with yields of 42.4–76.0 mg/L in shake-flask culture. Introducing an additional copy of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) gene through fusion expression of SmSTPS1-FDPS or dividing the FDP synthetic pathway into two modules resulted in significantly improved production, and ultimately 250 mg of (-)-5-epieremophilene were achieved. Biological assay indicated that (-)-5-epieremophilene showed significant antifeedant activity against Helicoverpa armigera (EC50=1.25 µg/cm2), a common pest of S. miltiorrhiza, implying its potential defensive role in the plant.

The isolation of allelochemicals is mainly addressed, but other aspects such as the analysis and activities of derivatives or analogs are also covered.

283,Reduced levels of volatile emissions in jasmonate-deficient spr2tomato mutants favour oviposition by insect herbivores,"Tomato plants release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) following insect or mechanical damage. In this study, the constitutive and wound-induced emission levels of VOCs in suppressor of prosystemin-mediated responses2 (spr2) mutant plants, compromised in linolenic acid (LA) and jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis, and in 35S::prosystemin (35S::prosys) plants, having upregulated direct defence responses, were compared. The spr2 mutants produced constitutively lower levels of VOCs, which were nonetheless increased in response to (a)biotic damage, although at lower levels than wild-type (Wt) and 35S::prosys plants. No significant differences in VOC emissions were detected between the latter two genotypes, thereby suggesting that systemin does not regulate indirect defence responses, whereas differences in fatty acid composition in spr2 plants led to the predominant emission of saturated C6 volatiles in response to wounding. The expression of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS2), a key gene involved in VOC synthesis in the chloroplast, was only upregulated in Manduca sexta L.-damaged Wt and 35S::prosys plants. However, its expression was restored in spr2 plants by exogenous LA or JA, suggesting that abated VOC emissions in spr2 plants are correlated with lowered DXS2 expression. Bioassays with two different insects showed that adult females significantly preferred spr2 plants, indicating that lowered levels of VOCs in tomato influence plant selection by insects during oviposition.",tomato plant release volatile organic compound vocs following insect mechanical damage in study constitutive wound induced emission level vocs suppressor prosystemin mediated response spr mutant plant compromised linolenic acid la jasmonic acid ja synthesis s prosystemin s prosys plant upregulated direct defence response compared the spr mutant produced constitutively lower level vocs nonetheless increased response biotic damage although lower level wild type wt s prosys plant no significant difference voc emission detected latter two genotype thereby suggesting systemin regulate indirect defence response whereas difference fatty acid composition spr plant led predominant emission saturated c volatile response wounding the expression deoxy xylulose phosphate synthase dxs key gene involved voc synthesis chloroplast upregulated manduca sexta l damaged wt s prosys plant however expression restored spr plant exogenous la ja suggesting abated voc emission spr plant correlated lowered dxs expression bioassays two different insect showed adult female significantly preferred spr plant indicating lowered level vocs tomato influence plant selection insect oviposition,low
284,Roles of plant volatiles in defence against microbial pathogens and microbial exploitation of volatiles,"Plants emit a large variety of volatile organic compounds during infection by pathogenic microbes, including terpenes, aromatics, nitrogen-containing compounds, and fatty acid derivatives, as well as the volatile plant hormones, methyl jasmonate, and methyl salicylate. Given the general antimicrobial activity of plant volatiles and the timing of emission following infection, these compounds have often been assumed to function in defence against pathogens without much solid evidence. In this review, we critically evaluate current knowledge on the toxicity of volatiles to fungi, bacteria, and viruses and their role in plant resistance as well as how they act to induce systemic resistance in uninfected parts of the plant and in neighbouring plants. We also discuss how microbes can detoxify plant volatiles and exploit them as nutrients, attractants for insect vectors, and inducers of volatile emissions, which stimulate immune responses that make plants more susceptible to infection. Although much more is known about plant volatile–herbivore interactions, knowledge of volatile–microbe interactions is growing and it may eventually be possible to harness plant volatiles to reduce disease in agriculture and forestry. Future research in this field can be facilitated by making use of the analytical and molecular tools generated by the prolific research on plant–herbivore interactions.",plants emit large variety volatile organic compound infection pathogenic microbe including terpene aromatics nitrogen containing compound fatty acid derivative well volatile plant hormone methyl jasmonate methyl salicylate given general antimicrobial activity plant volatile timing emission following infection compound often assumed function defence pathogen without much solid evidence in review critically evaluate current knowledge toxicity volatile fungi bacteria virus role plant resistance well act induce systemic resistance uninfected part plant neighbouring plant we also discus microbe detoxify plant volatile exploit nutrient attractants insect vector inducer volatile emission stimulate immune response make plant susceptible infection although much known plant volatile herbivore interaction knowledge volatile microbe interaction growing may eventually possible harness plant volatile reduce disease agriculture forestry future research field facilitated making use analytical molecular tool generated prolific research plant herbivore interaction,low

287,Synthetic biology for production of natural and new-to-nature terpenoids in photosynthetic organisms,"With tens of thousands of characterized members, terpenoids constitute the largest class of natural compounds that are synthesized by all living organisms. Several terpenoids play primary roles in the maintenance of cell membrane fluidity, as pigments or as phytohormones, but most of them function as specialized metabolites that are involved in plant resistance to herbivores or plant–environment interactions. Terpenoids are an essential component of human nutrition, and many are economically important pharmaceuticals, aromatics and potential next-generation biofuels. Because of the often low abundance in their natural source, as well as the demand for novel terpenoid structures with new or improved bioactivities, terpenoid biosynthesis has become a prime target for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology projects. In this review we focus on the creation of new-to-nature or tailor-made plant-derived terpenoids in photosynthetic organisms, in particular by means of combinatorial biosynthesis and the activation of silent metabolism.

288,Targeted proteomics using selected reaction monitoring reveals the induction of specific terpene synthases in a multi-level study of methyl jasmonate-treated Norway spruce (Picea abies ),"Induction of terpene synthase (TPS) gene expression and enzyme activity is known to occur in response to various chemical and biological stimuli in several species of spruce (genus Picea). However, high sequence identity between TPS family members has made it difficult to determine the induction patterns of individual TPS at the protein and transcript levels and whether specific TPS enzymes respond differentially to treatment. In the present study we used a multi-level approach to measure the induction and activity of TPS enzymes in protein extracts of Norway spruce (Picea abies) bark tissue following treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Measurements were made on the transcript, protein, enzyme activity and metabolite levels. Using a relatively new proteomics application, selective reaction monitoring (SRM), it was possible to differentiate and quantitatively measure the abundance of several known TPS proteins and three 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) isoforms in Norway spruce. Protein levels of individual TPS and DXS enzymes were differentially induced upon MeJA treatment and good correlation was generally observed between induction of transcripts, proteins, and enzyme activities. Most of the mono- and diterpenoid metabolites accumulated with similar temporal patterns of induction as part of the coordinated multi-compound chemical defense response. Protein and enzyme activity levels of the monoTPS (+)-3-carene synthase and the corresponding accumulation of (+)-3-carene was induced to a higher fold change than any other TPS or metabolite measured, indicating an important role in the induced terpenoid defense response in Norway spruce.",induction terpene synthase tps gene expression enzyme activity known occur response various chemical biological stimulus several specie spruce genus picea however high sequence identity tps family member made difficult determine induction pattern individual tps protein transcript level whether specific tps enzyme respond differentially treatment in present study used multi level approach measure induction activity tps enzyme protein extract norway spruce picea abies bark tissue following treatment methyl jasmonate meja measurements made transcript protein enzyme activity metabolite level using relatively new proteomics application selective reaction monitoring srm possible differentiate quantitatively measure abundance several known tps protein three deoxy xylulose phosphate synthase dxs isoforms norway spruce protein level individual tps dxs enzyme differentially induced upon meja treatment good correlation generally observed induction transcript protein enzyme activity most mono diterpenoid metabolite accumulated similar temporal pattern induction part coordinated multi compound chemical defense response protein enzyme activity level monotps carene synthase corresponding accumulation carene induced higher fold change tps metabolite measured indicating important role induced terpenoid defense response norway spruce,low
289,Temperature and light dependence of ß-caryophyllene emission rates,"[1] Assessments of the overall release of reactive volatile organic compounds from vegetation require the knowledge of the effect of temperature and light intensity on emission rates. The aim of the study presented here was to investigate whether the rates of emission of the highly reactive sesquiterpene ß-Caryophyllene (BCAR) from foliage of orange trees (Citrus sinensis (L.) OSBECK, var. Navel and Navel Late), detected using branch enclosures in an orange orchard in Spain, were not only temperature but also light dependent. We used two algorithms to calculate the diurnal variation of BCAR emission rates from environmental data. One algorithm accounted exclusively for the known exponential relationship between emission rate and temperature, and the other for both temperature and light effects. Assuming a light and temperature dependence of BCAR emission rates led to a more precise prediction of the short-term variation of BCAR emission rates than assuming that emissions are affected exclusively by temperature. The light dependence of BCAR emission rates could be due to a modulation of BCAR synthesis by light, or to an enhanced volatilization of BCAR from storage pools under high light exposure, or a combination of both. The data show that present assessments of the total release of reactive volatile organic compounds from vegetation, disregarding light effects on BCAR emission, are highly uncertain, if BCAR considerably contributes to total terpenoid emissions of the investigated plants.",assessments overall release reactive volatile organic compound vegetation require knowledge effect temperature light intensity emission rate the aim study presented investigate whether rate emission highly reactive sesquiterpene caryophyllene bcar foliage orange tree citrus sinensis l osbeck var navel navel late detected using branch enclosure orange orchard spain temperature also light dependent we used two algorithm calculate diurnal variation bcar emission rate environmental data one algorithm accounted exclusively known exponential relationship emission rate temperature temperature light effect assuming light temperature dependence bcar emission rate led precise prediction short term variation bcar emission rate assuming emission affected exclusively temperature the light dependence bcar emission rate could due modulation bcar synthesis light enhanced volatilization bcar storage pool high light exposure combination the data show present assessment total release reactive volatile organic compound vegetation disregarding light effect bcar emission highly uncertain bcar considerably contributes total terpenoid emission investigated plant,low
290,Terpene glucoside production: Improved biocatalytic processes using glycosyltransferases,"Terpenoids are one of the main classes of natural products. In plants, a large fraction of the terpenoids is present as nonvolatile glycosides. The terpene glycosides have attracted much attention as antimicrobials, flavor precursors, and detergents. They are either extracted from plant materials or are synthesized by chemical and biocatalytic methods. Up to now, biotechnological production of terpene glycosides is based on reversed hydrolysis performed by glycosidases. However, this method suffers from low yields as a matter of principle. Recently, the first uridine diphosphate-glucose:monoterpenol ß-d-glucosyltransferase (GT) genes were cloned and characterized from grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa). Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli yielded promiscuous GT enzymes that efficiently glucosylated primary monoterpenols, simple alcohols, and phenols. The GT enzymes differed in substrate preference and activity toward their terpenoid substrates. Biotransformation experiments confirmed the applicability of the novel GTs in biocatalytic processes for the production of these novel compounds.

In addition, many of the structurally diverse plant terpenoids may function in taxonomically more discrete, specialized interactions with other organisms. Historically, specialized terpenoids, together with alkaloids and many of the phenolics, have been referred to as secondary metabolites. More recently, these compounds have become widely recognized, conceptually and/or empirically, for their essential ecological functions in plant biology. Owing to their diverse biological activities and their diverse physical and chemical properties, terpenoid plant chemicals have been exploited by humans as traditional biomaterials in the form of complex mixtures or in the form of more or less pure compounds since ancient times. Plant terpenoids are widely used as industrially relevant chemicals, including many pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, pesticides and disinfectants, and as large-volume feedstocks for chemical industries. Recently, there has been a renaissance of awareness of plant terpenoids as a valuable biological resource for societies that will have to become less reliant on petrochemicals. Harnessing the powers of plant and microbial systems for production of economically valuable plant terpenoids requires interdisciplinary and often expensive research into their chemistry, biosynthesis and genomics, as well as metabolic and biochemical engineering. This paper provides an overview of the formation of hemi-, mono-, sesqui- and diterpenoids in plants, and highlights some well-established examples for these classes of terpenoids in the context of biomaterials and biofuels.",terpenoids isoprenoids encompass structure form largest class known plant metabolite some terpenoids well characterized physiological function common plant specie in addition many structurally diverse plant terpenoids may function taxonomically discrete specialized interaction organism historically specialized terpenoids together alkaloid many phenolic referred secondary metabolite more recently compound become widely recognized conceptually empirically essential ecological function plant biology owing diverse biological activity diverse physical chemical property terpenoid plant chemical exploited human traditional biomaterials form complex mixture form le pure compound since ancient time plant terpenoids widely used industrially relevant chemical including many pharmaceutical flavour fragrance pesticide disinfectant large volume feedstock chemical industry recently renaissance awareness plant terpenoids valuable biological resource society become le reliant petrochemical harnessing power plant microbial system production economically valuable plant terpenoids requires interdisciplinary often expensive research chemistry biosynthesis genomics well metabolic biochemical engineering this paper provides overview formation hemi mono sesqui diterpenoids plant highlight well established example class terpenoids context biomaterials biofuels,medium
292,Terpenoid Biosynthesis and Specialized Vascular Cells of Conifer Defense,"Defense-related terpenoid biosynthesis in conifers is a dynamic process closely associated with specialized anatomical structures that allows conifers to cope with attack from many potential pests and pathogens. The constitutive and inducible terpenoid defense of conifers involves several hundred different monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Changing arrays of these many compounds are formed from the general isoprenoid pathway by activities of large gene families for two classes of enzymes, the terpene synthases and the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases of the CYP720B group. Extensive studies have been conducted on the genomics, proteomics and molecular biochemical characterization of these enzymes. Many of the conifer terpene synthases are multi-product enzymes, and the P450 enzymes of the CYP720B group are promiscuous in catalyzing multiple oxidations, along homologous series of diterpenoids, from a broad spectrum of substrates. The terpene synthases and CYP720B genes respond to authentic or simulated insect attack with increased transcript levels, protein abundance and enzyme activity. The constitutive and induced oleoresin terpenoids for conifer defense accumulate in preformed cortical resin ducts and in xylem trauma-associated resin ducts. Formation of these resin ducts de novo in the cambium zone and developing xylem, following insect attack or treatment of trees with methyl jasmonate, is a unique feature of the induced defense of long-lived conifer trees.",defense related terpenoid biosynthesis conifer dynamic process closely associated specialized anatomical structure allows conifer cope attack many potential pest pathogen the constitutive inducible terpenoid defense conifer involves several hundred different monoterpenes sesquiterpenes diterpenes changing array many compound formed general isoprenoid pathway activity large gene family two class enzyme terpene synthases cytochrome p dependent monooxygenases cyp b group extensive study conducted genomics proteomics molecular biochemical characterization enzyme many conifer terpene synthases multi product enzyme p enzyme cyp b group promiscuous catalyzing multiple oxidation along homologous series diterpenoids broad spectrum substrate the terpene synthases cyp b gene respond authentic simulated insect attack increased transcript level protein abundance enzyme activity the constitutive induced oleoresin terpenoids conifer defense accumulate preformed cortical resin duct xylem trauma associated resin duct formation resin duct de novo cambium zone developing xylem following insect attack treatment tree methyl jasmonate unique feature induced defense long lived conifer tree,low
293,The family of terpene synthases in plants: a mid-size family of genes for specialized metabolism that is highly diversified throughout the kingdom,"Some plant terpenes such as sterols and carotenes are part of primary metabolism and found essentially in all plants. However, the majority of the terpenes found in plants are classified as ‘secondary’ compounds, those chemicals whose synthesis has evolved in plants as a result of selection for increased fitness via better adaptation to the local ecological niche of each species. Thousands of such terpenes have been found in the plant kingdom, but each species is capable of synthesizing only a small fraction of this total. In plants, a family of terpene synthases (TPSs) is responsible for the synthesis of the various terpene molecules from two isomeric 5-carbon precursor ‘building blocks’, leading to 5-carbon isoprene, 10-carbon monoterpenes, 15-carbon sesquiterpenes and 20-carbon diterpenes. The bryophyte Physcomitrella patens has a single TPS gene, copalyl synthase/kaurene synthase (CPS/KS), encoding a bifunctional enzyme producing ent-kaurene, which is a precursor of gibberellins. The genome of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii contains 18 TPS genes, and the genomes of some model angiosperms and gymnosperms contain 40–152 TPS genes, not all of them functional and most of the functional ones having lost activity in either the CPS- or KS-type domains. TPS genes are generally divided into seven clades, with some plant lineages having a majority of their TPS genes in one or two clades, indicating lineage-specific expansion of specific types of genes. Evolutionary plasticity is evident in the TPS family, with closely related enzymes differing in their product profiles, subcellular localization, or the in planta substrates they use.",some plant terpene sterol carotene part primary metabolism found essentially plant however majority terpene found plant classified secondary compound chemical whose synthesis evolved plant result selection increased fitness via better adaptation local ecological niche specie thousands terpene found plant kingdom specie capable synthesizing small fraction total in plant family terpene synthases tpss responsible synthesis various terpene molecule two isomeric carbon precursor building block leading carbon isoprene carbon monoterpenes carbon sesquiterpenes carbon diterpenes the bryophyte physcomitrella patens single tps gene copalyl synthase kaurene synthase cps ks encoding bifunctional enzyme producing ent kaurene precursor gibberellin the genome lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii contains tps gene genome model angiosperm gymnosperm contain tps gene functional functional one lost activity either cps ks type domain tps gene generally divided seven clade plant lineage majority tps gene one two clade indicating lineage specific expansion specific type gene evolutionary plasticity evident tps family closely related enzyme differing product profile subcellular localization planta substrate use,low

296,The scarecrow-like transcription factor SlSCL3 regulates volatile terpene biosynthesis and glandular trichome size in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum),"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) type VI glandular trichomes that occur on the surface of leaves, stems, young fruits and flowers produce and store a blend of volatile monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. These compounds play important roles in the interaction with pathogens and herbivorous insects. Although the function of terpene synthases in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenes in tomato has been comprehensively investigated, the deciphering of their transcriptional regulation is only just emerging. We selected transcription factors that are over-expressed in trichomes based on existing transcriptome data and silenced them individually by virus-induced gene silencing. Of these, SlSCL3, a scarecrow-like (SCL) subfamily transcription factor, led to a significant decrease in volatile terpene content and expression of the corresponding terpene synthase genes when its transcription level was downregulated. Overexpression of SlSCL3 dramatically increased both the volatile terpene content and glandular trichome size, whereas its homozygous mutants showed reduced terpene biosynthesis. However, its heterozygous mutants also showed a significantly elevated volatile terpene content and enlarged glandular trichomes, similar to the overexpression plants. SlSCL3 modulates the expression of terpene biosynthetic pathway genes by transcriptional activation, but neither direct protein–DNA binding nor interaction with known regulators was observed. Moreover, transcript levels of the endogenous copy of SlSCL3 were decreased in the overexpression plants but increased in the heterozygous and homozygous mutants, suggesting feedback repression of its own promoter. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the role of SlSCL3 in the complex regulation of volatile terpene biosynthesis and glandular trichome development in tomato.",tomato solanum lycopersicum l type vi glandular trichomes occur surface leaf stem young fruit flower produce store blend volatile monoterpenes sesquiterpenes these compound play important role interaction pathogen herbivorous insect although function terpene synthases biosynthesis volatile terpene tomato comprehensively investigated deciphering transcriptional regulation emerging we selected transcription factor expressed trichomes based existing transcriptome data silenced individually virus induced gene silencing of slscl scarecrow like scl subfamily transcription factor led significant decrease volatile terpene content expression corresponding terpene synthase gene transcription level downregulated overexpression slscl dramatically increased volatile terpene content glandular trichome size whereas homozygous mutant showed reduced terpene biosynthesis however heterozygous mutant also showed significantly elevated volatile terpene content enlarged glandular trichomes similar overexpression plant slscl modulates expression terpene biosynthetic pathway gene transcriptional activation neither direct protein dna binding interaction known regulator observed moreover transcript level endogenous copy slscl decreased overexpression plant increased heterozygous homozygous mutant suggesting feedback repression promoter taken together result provide new insight role slscl complex regulation volatile terpene biosynthesis glandular trichome development tomato,low
297,Two independent biochemical pathways for isopentenyl diphosphate and isoprenoid biosynthesis in higher plants,"In the early times of isoprenoid research, a single pathway was found for the formation of the C5 monomer, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), and this acetate/mevalonate pathway was supposed to occur ubiquitously in all living organisms. Now, 40 years later, a totally different IPP biosynthesis route has been detected in eubacteria, green algae and higher plants. In this new pathway glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate are precursors of isopentenyl diphosphate, but not acetyl-CoA and mevalonic acid. In green tissues of three higher plants it was shown that all chloroplastbound isoprenoids (ß-carotene, phytyl chains of chlorophylls and nona-prenyl chain of plastoquinone-9) are formed via the GAP/pyruvate pathway, whereas the cytoplasmic sterols are formed via the acetate/mevalonate pathway. Also, isoprene, emitted by various plants at high light conditions by action of the plastid-bound isoprene synthase, is formed via the new GAP/pyruvate pathway. Thus, in higher plants, there exist two separate and biochemically different IPP biosynthesis pathways: (1) the novel alternative GAP/pyruvate pathway apparently bound to the plastidic compartment and (2) the classical cytoplasmic acetate/mevalonate pathway. This new GAP/pyruvate pathway for IPP formation allows a reasonable interpretation of previous odd results concerning the biosynthesis of chloroplast isoprenoids, which, so far, had mainly been interpreted assuming compartmentation differences.

298,Up-regulation of an N-terminal truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase enhances production of essential oils and sterols in transgenic Lavandula latifolia,"Spike lavender (Lavandula latifolia) essential oil is widely used in the perfume, cosmetic, flavouring and pharmaceutical industries. Thus, modifications of yield and composition of this essential oil by genetic engineering should have important scientific and commercial applications. We generated transgenic spike lavender plants expressing the Arabidopsis thaliana HMG1 cDNA, encoding the catalytic domain of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR1S), a key enzyme of the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway. Transgenic T0 plants accumulated significantly more essential oil constituents as compared to controls (up to 2.1- and 1.8-fold in leaves and flowers, respectively). Enhanced expression of HMGR1S also increased the amount of the end-product sterols, ß-sitosterol and stigmasterol (average differences of 1.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively), but did not affect the accumulation of carotenoids or chlorophylls. We also analysed T1 plants derived from self-pollinated seeds of T0 lines that flowered after growing for 2 years in the greenhouse. The increased levels of essential oil and sterols observed in the transgenic T0 plants were maintained in the progeny that inherited the HMG1 transgene. Our results demonstrate that genetic manipulation of the MVA pathway increases essential oil yield in spike lavender, suggesting a contribution for this cytosolic pathway to monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in leaves and flowers of the species.",spike lavender lavandula latifolia essential oil widely used perfume cosmetic flavouring pharmaceutical industry thus modification yield composition essential oil genetic engineering important scientific commercial application we generated transgenic spike lavender plant expressing arabidopsis thaliana hmg cdna encoding catalytic domain hydroxy methylglutaryl coa reductase hmgr s key enzyme mevalonic acid mva pathway transgenic t plant accumulated significantly essential oil constituent compared control fold leaf flower respectively enhanced expression hmgr s also increased amount end product sterol sitosterol stigmasterol average difference fold respectively affect accumulation carotenoid chlorophyll we also analysed t plant derived self pollinated seed t line flowered growing year greenhouse the increased level essential oil sterol observed transgenic t plant maintained progeny inherited hmg transgene our result demonstrate genetic manipulation mva pathway increase essential oil yield spike lavender suggesting contribution cytosolic pathway monoterpene sesquiterpene biosynthesis leaf flower specie,low
299,UV-B irradiation differentially regulates terpene synthases and terpene content of peach,"Plants generate protective molecules in response to ultraviolet (UV) light. In laboratory experiments, 48 h UV-B irradiation of peach fruits and leaves reduced the flavour-related monoterpene linalool by 60%. No isoprene was detected, but other terpenoids increased significantly, including a threefold accumulation of the sesquiterpene (E,E)-a-farnesene, which was also increased by jasmonic acid treatment. RNA sequencing revealed altered transcript levels for two terpene synthases (TPSs): PpTPS1, a TPS-g subfamily member, decreased by 86% and PpTPS2, a TPS-b subfamily member, increased 80-fold. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and transient overexpression in tobacco and peach fruits showed PpTPS1 was localized in plastids and associated with production of linalool, while PpTPS2 was responsible for (E,E)-a-farnesene biosynthesis in the cytoplasm. Candidate regulatory genes for these responses were identified. Commercial peach production in Asia involves fruit bagging to maintain marketable yield and quality. TPS gene expression and volatile terpenoid production in field experiments, using bags transmitting high UV-B radiation, showed similar effects on peach volatiles to those from laboratory experiments. Bags transmitting less UV-B light ameliorated the reduction in the flavour volatile linalool, indicating that flavour components of peach fruits can be modulated by selecting an appropriate source of environmental screening material.",plants generate protective molecule response ultraviolet uv light in laboratory experiment h uv b irradiation peach fruit leaf reduced flavour related monoterpene linalool no isoprene detected terpenoids increased significantly including threefold accumulation sesquiterpene e e farnesene also increased jasmonic acid treatment rna sequencing revealed altered transcript level two terpene synthases tpss pptps tps g subfamily member decreased pptps tps b subfamily member increased fold heterologous expression escherichia coli transient overexpression tobacco peach fruit showed pptps localized plastid associated production linalool pptps responsible e e farnesene biosynthesis cytoplasm candidate regulatory gene response identified commercial peach production asia involves fruit bagging maintain marketable yield quality tps gene expression volatile terpenoid production field experiment using bag transmitting high uv b radiation showed similar effect peach volatile laboratory experiment bags transmitting le uv b light ameliorated reduction flavour volatile linalool indicating flavour component peach fruit modulated selecting appropriate source environmental screening material,low
300,Volatile terpenes – mediators of plant-to-plant communication,"Plants interact with other organisms employing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The largest group of plant-released VOCs are terpenes, comprised of isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. Mono- and sesquiterpenes are well-known communication compounds in plant–insect interactions, whereas the smallest, most commonly emitted terpene, isoprene, is rather assigned a function in combating abiotic stresses. Recently, it has become evident that different volatile terpenes also act as plant-to-plant signaling cues. Upon being perceived, specific volatile terpenes can sensitize distinct signaling pathways in receiver plant cells, which in turn trigger plant innate immune responses. This vastly extends the range of action of volatile terpenes, which not only protect plants from various biotic and abiotic stresses, but also convey information about environmental constraints within and between plants. As a result, plant–insect and plant–pathogen interactions, which are believed to influence each other through phytohormone crosstalk, are likely equally sensitive to reciprocal regulation via volatile terpene cues. Here, we review the current knowledge of terpenes as volatile semiochemicals and discuss why and how volatile terpenes make good signaling cues. We discuss how volatile terpenes may be perceived by plants, what are possible downstream signaling events in receiver plants, and how responses to different terpene cues might interact to orchestrate the net plant response to multiple stresses. Finally, we discuss how the signal can be further transmitted to the community level leading to a mutually beneficial community-scale response or distinct signaling with near kin.",plants interact organism employing volatile organic compound vocs the largest group plant released vocs terpene comprised isoprene monoterpenes sesquiterpenes mono sesquiterpenes well known communication compound plant insect interaction whereas smallest commonly emitted terpene isoprene rather assigned function combating abiotic stress recently become evident different volatile terpene also act plant plant signaling cue upon perceived specific volatile terpene sensitize distinct signaling pathway receiver plant cell turn trigger plant innate immune response this vastly extends range action volatile terpene protect plant various biotic abiotic stress also convey information environmental constraint within plant as result plant insect plant pathogen interaction believed influence phytohormone crosstalk likely equally sensitive reciprocal regulation via volatile terpene cue here review current knowledge terpene volatile semiochemicals discus volatile terpene make good signaling cue we discus volatile terpene may perceived plant possible downstream signaling event receiver plant response different terpene cue might interact orchestrate net plant response multiple stress finally discus signal transmitted community level leading mutually beneficial community scale response distinct signaling near kin,low
301,Natural Variation in Monoterpene Synthesis in Kiwifruit: Transcriptional Regulation of Terpene Synthases by NAC and ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-Like Transcription Factors,"Two kiwifruit (Actinidia) species with contrasting terpene profiles were compared to understand the regulation of fruit monoterpene production. High rates of terpinolene production in ripe Actinidia arguta fruit were correlated with increasing gene and protein expression of A. arguta terpene synthase1 (AaTPS1) and correlated with an increase in transcript levels of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS). Actinidia chinensis terpene synthase1 (AcTPS1) was identified as part of an array of eight tandemly duplicated genes, and AcTPS1 expression and terpene production were observed only at low levels in developing fruit. Transient overexpression of DXS in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves elevated monoterpene synthesis by AaTPS1 more than 100-fold, indicating that DXS is likely to be the key step in regulating 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate substrate flux in kiwifruit. Comparative promoter analysis identified potential NAC (for no apical meristem [NAM], Arabidopsis transcription activation factor [ATAF], and cup-shaped cotyledon [CUC])-domain transcription factor) and ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-like transcription factor (TF) binding sites in the AaTPS1 promoter, and cloned members of both TF classes were able to activate the AaTPS1 promoter in transient assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that AaNAC2, AaNAC3, and AaNAC4 bind a 28-bp fragment of the proximal NAC binding site in the AaTPS1 promoter but not the A. chinensis AcTPS1 promoter, where the NAC binding site was mutated. Activation could be restored by reintroducing multiple repeats of the 12-bp NAC core-binding motif. The absence of NAC transcriptional activation in ripe A. chinensis fruit can account for the low accumulation of AcTPS1 transcript, protein, and monoterpene volatiles in this species. These results indicate the importance of NAC TFs in controlling monoterpene production and other traits in ripening fruits.",two kiwifruit actinidia specie contrasting terpene profile compared understand regulation fruit monoterpene production high rate terpinolene production ripe actinidia arguta fruit correlated increasing gene protein expression a arguta terpene synthase aatps correlated increase transcript level c methyl d erythritol phosphate pathway enzyme deoxy d xylulose phosphate synthase dxs actinidia chinensis terpene synthase actps identified part array eight tandemly duplicated gene actps expression terpene production observed low level developing fruit transient overexpression dxs nicotiana benthamiana leaf elevated monoterpene synthesis aatps fold indicating dxs likely key step regulating c methyl d erythritol phosphate substrate flux kiwifruit comparative promoter analysis identified potential nac apical meristem nam arabidopsis transcription activation factor ataf cup shaped cotyledon cuc domain transcription factor ethylene insensitive like transcription factor tf binding site aatps promoter cloned member tf class able activate aatps promoter transient assay electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed aanac aanac aanac bind bp fragment proximal nac binding site aatps promoter a chinensis actps promoter nac binding site mutated activation could restored reintroducing multiple repeat bp nac core binding motif the absence nac transcriptional activation ripe a chinensis fruit account low accumulation actps transcript protein monoterpene volatile specie these result indicate importance nac tfs controlling monoterpene production trait ripening fruit,low
302,Oak powdery mildew (Erysiphe alphitoides)-induced volatile emissions scale with the degree of infection in Quercus robur,"Oak powdery mildew (Erysiphe alphitoides) is a major foliar pathogen of Quercus robur often infecting entire tree stands. In this study, foliage photosynthetic characteristics and constitutive and induced volatile emissions were studied in Q. robur leaves, in order to determine whether the changes in foliage physiological traits are quantitatively associated with the degree of leaf infection, and whether infection changes the light responses of physiological traits. Infection by E. alphitoides reduced net assimilation rate by 3.5-fold and isoprene emission rate by 2.4-fold, and increased stomatal conductance by 1.6-fold in leaves with the largest degree of infection of ~60%. These alterations in physiological activity were quantitatively associated with the fraction of leaf area infected. In addition, light saturation of net assimilation and isoprene emission was reached at lower light intensity in infected leaves, and infection also reduced the initial quantum yield of isoprene emission. Infection-induced emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles and monoterpenes were light-dependent and scaled positively with the degree of infection. Overall, this study indicates that the reduction of foliage photosynthetic activity and constitutive emissions and the onset of stress volatile emissions scale with the degree of infection, but also that the infection modifies the light responses of foliage physiological activities.",oak powdery mildew erysiphe alphitoides major foliar pathogen quercus robur often infecting entire tree stand in study foliage photosynthetic characteristic constitutive induced volatile emission studied q robur leaf order determine whether change foliage physiological trait quantitatively associated degree leaf infection whether infection change light response physiological trait infection e alphitoides reduced net assimilation rate fold isoprene emission rate fold increased stomatal conductance fold leaf largest degree infection these alteration physiological activity quantitatively associated fraction leaf area infected in addition light saturation net assimilation isoprene emission reached lower light intensity infected leaf infection also reduced initial quantum yield isoprene emission infection induced emission lipoxygenase pathway volatile monoterpenes light dependent scaled positively degree infection overall study indicates reduction foliage photosynthetic activity constitutive emission onset stress volatile emission scale degree infection also infection modifies light response foliage physiological activity,low

The short-chain isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDS) are situated at critical branch points in terpene biosynthesis, producing the precursors of the different terpenoid classes. To determine the role of IDS and to create altered terpene phenotypes for assessing the defensive role of terpenoids, we overexpressed a bifunctional spruce IDS, a geranyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase in white spruce (Picea glauca) saplings. While transcript level (350-fold), enzyme activity level (7-fold), and in planta geranyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate levels (4- to 8-fold) were significantly increased in the needles of transgenic plants, there was no increase in the major monoterpenes and diterpene acids of the resin and no change in primary isoprenoids, such as sterols, chlorophylls, and carotenoids. Instead, large amounts of geranylgeranyl fatty acid esters, known from various gymnosperm and angiosperm plant species, accumulated in needles and were shown to act defensively in reducing the performance of larvae of the nun moth (Lymantria monacha), a conifer pest in Eurasia.

305,Plant Glandular Trichomes: Natural Cell Factories of High Biotechnological Interest,"Multicellular glandular trichomes are epidermal outgrowths characterized by the presence of a head made of cells that have the ability to secrete or store large quantities of specialized metabolites. Our understanding of the transcriptional control of glandular trichome initiation and development is still in its infancy. This review points to some central questions that need to be addressed to better understand how such specialized cell structures arise from the plant protodermis. A key and unique feature of glandular trichomes is their ability to synthesize and secrete large amounts, relative to their size, of a limited number of metabolites. As such, they qualify as true cell factories, making them interesting targets for metabolic engineering. In this review, recent advances regarding terpene metabolic engineering are highlighted, with a special focus on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). In particular, the choice of transcriptional promoters to drive transgene expression and the best ways to sink existing pools of terpene precursors are discussed. The bioavailability of existing pools of natural precursor molecules is a key parameter and is controlled by so-called cross talk between different biosynthetic pathways. As highlighted in this review, the exact nature and extent of such cross talk are only partially understood at present. In the future, awareness of, and detailed knowledge on, the biology of plant glandular trichome development and metabolism will generate new leads to tap the largely unexploited potential of glandular trichomes in plant resistance to pests and lead to the improved production of specialized metabolites with high industrial or pharmacological value.",multicellular glandular trichomes epidermal outgrowth characterized presence head made cell ability secrete store large quantity specialized metabolite our understanding transcriptional control glandular trichome initiation development still infancy this review point central question need addressed better understand specialized cell structure arise plant protodermis a key unique feature glandular trichomes ability synthesize secrete large amount relative size limited number metabolite as qualify true cell factory making interesting target metabolic engineering in review recent advance regarding terpene metabolic engineering highlighted special focus tobacco nicotiana tabacum in particular choice transcriptional promoter drive transgene expression best way sink existing pool terpene precursor discussed the bioavailability existing pool natural precursor molecule key parameter controlled called cross talk different biosynthetic pathway as highlighted review exact nature extent cross talk partially understood present in future awareness detailed knowledge biology plant glandular trichome development metabolism generate new lead tap largely unexploited potential glandular trichomes plant resistance pest lead improved production specialized metabolite high industrial pharmacological value,high

307,"Regulation of Oleoresinosis in Grand Fir (Abies grandis)1: Differential Transcriptional Control of Monoterpene, Sesquiterpene, and Diterpene Synthase Genes in Response to Wounding","Grand fir (Abies grandis Lindl.) has been developed as a model system for the study of wound-induced oleoresinosis in conifers as a response to insect attack. Oleoresin is a roughly equal mixture of turpentine (85% monoterpenes [C10] and 15% sesquiterpenes [C15]) and rosin (diterpene [C20] resin acids) that acts to seal wounds and is toxic to both invading insects and their pathogenic fungal symbionts. The dynamic regulation of wound-induced oleoresin formation was studied over 29 d at the enzyme level by in vitro assay of the three classes of synthases directly responsible for the formation of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes from the corresponding C10, C15, and C20 prenyl diphosphate precursors, and at the gene level by RNA-blot hybridization using terpene synthase class-directed DNA probes. In overall appearance, the shapes of the time-course curves for all classes of synthase activities are similar, suggesting coordinate formation of all of the terpenoid types. However, closer inspection indicates that the monoterpene synthases arise earlier, as shown by an abbreviated time course over 6 to 48 h. RNA-blot analyses indicated that the genes for all three classes of enzymes are transcriptionally activated in response to wounding, with the monoterpene synthases up-regulated first (transcripts detectable 2 h after wounding), in agreement with the results of cell-free assays of monoterpene synthase activity, followed by the coordinately regulated sesquiterpene synthases and diterpene synthases (transcription beginning on d 3–4).

308,Relative Mass Defect Filtering of Mass Spectra: A Path to Discovery of Plant Specialized Metabolites  ,"The rapid identification of novel plant metabolites and assignments of newly discovered substances to natural product classes present the main bottlenecks to defining plant specialized phenotypes. Although mass spectrometry provides powerful support for metabolite discovery by measuring molecular masses, ambiguities in elemental formulas often fail to reveal the biosynthetic origins of specialized metabolites detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A promising approach for mining liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolite profiling data for specific metabolite classes is achieved by calculating relative mass defects (RMDs) from molecular and fragment ions. This strategy enabled the rapid recognition of an extensive range of terpenoid metabolites in complex plant tissue extracts and is independent of retention time, abundance, and elemental formula. Using RMD filtering and tandem mass spectrometry data analysis, 24 novel elemental formulas corresponding to glycosylated sesquiterpenoid metabolites were identified in extracts of the wild tomato Solanum habrochaites LA1777 trichomes. Extensive isomerism was revealed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, leading to evidence of more than 200 distinct sesquiterpenoid metabolites. RMD filtering led to the recognition of the presence of glycosides of two unusual sesquiterpenoid cores that bear limited similarity to known sesquiterpenes in the genus Solanum. In addition, RMD filtering is readily applied to existing metabolomics databases and correctly classified the annotated terpenoid metabolites in the public metabolome database for Catharanthus roseus.",the rapid identification novel plant metabolite assignment newly discovered substance natural product class present main bottleneck defining plant specialized phenotype although mass spectrometry provides powerful support metabolite discovery measuring molecular mass ambiguity elemental formula often fail reveal biosynthetic origin specialized metabolite detected using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry a promising approach mining liquid chromatography mass spectrometry metabolite profiling data specific metabolite class achieved calculating relative mass defect rmds molecular fragment ion this strategy enabled rapid recognition extensive range terpenoid metabolite complex plant tissue extract independent retention time abundance elemental formula using rmd filtering tandem mass spectrometry data analysis novel elemental formula corresponding glycosylated sesquiterpenoid metabolite identified extract wild tomato solanum habrochaites la trichomes extensive isomerism revealed ultra high performance liquid chromatography leading evidence distinct sesquiterpenoid metabolite rmd filtering led recognition presence glycoside two unusual sesquiterpenoid core bear limited similarity known sesquiterpenes genus solanum in addition rmd filtering readily applied existing metabolomics database correctly classified annotated terpenoid metabolite public metabolome database catharanthus roseus,low
309,Scaling of photosynthesis and constitutive and induced volatile emissions with severity of leaf infection by rust fungus (Melampsora larici-populina) in Populus balsamifera var. suaveolens,"Fungal infections result in decreases in photosynthesis, induction of stress and signaling volatile emissions and reductions in constitutive volatile emissions, but the way different physiological processes scale with the severity of infection is poorly known. We studied the effects of infection by the obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen Melampsora larici-populina Kleb., the causal agent of poplar leaf rust disease, on photosynthetic characteristics, and constitutive isoprene and induced volatile emissions in leaves of Populus balsamifera var. suaveolens (Fisch.) Loudon. exhibiting different degrees of damage. The degree of fungal damage, quantified by the total area of chlorotic and necrotic leaf areas, varied between 0 (noninfected control) and ~60%. The rates of all physiological processes scaled quantitatively with the degree of visual damage, but the scaling with damage severity was weaker for photosynthetic characteristics than for constitutive and induced volatile release. Over the whole range of damage severity, the net assimilation rate per area (AA) decreased 1.5-fold, dry mass per unit area 2.4-fold and constitutive isoprene emissions 5-fold, while stomatal conductance increased 1.9-fold and dark respiration rate 1.6-fold. The emissions of key stress and signaling volatiles (methanol, green leaf volatiles, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and methyl salicylate) were in most cases nondetectable in noninfested leaves, and increased strongly with increasing the spread of infection. The moderate reduction in AA resulted from the loss of photosynthetically active biomass, but the reduction in constitutive isoprene emissions and the increase in induced volatile emissions primarily reflected changes in the activities of corresponding biochemical pathways. Although all physiological alterations in fungal-infected leaves occurred in a stress severity-dependent manner, modifications in primary and secondary metabolic pathways scaled differently due to contrasting operational mechanisms.",fungal infection result decrease photosynthesis induction stress signaling volatile emission reduction constitutive volatile emission way different physiological process scale severity infection poorly known we studied effect infection obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen melampsora larici populina kleb causal agent poplar leaf rust disease photosynthetic characteristic constitutive isoprene induced volatile emission leaf populus balsamifera var suaveolens fisch loudon exhibiting different degree damage the degree fungal damage quantified total area chlorotic necrotic leaf area varied noninfected control the rate physiological process scaled quantitatively degree visual damage scaling damage severity weaker photosynthetic characteristic constitutive induced volatile release over whole range damage severity net assimilation rate per area aa decreased fold dry mass per unit area fold constitutive isoprene emission fold stomatal conductance increased fold dark respiration rate fold the emission key stress signaling volatile methanol green leaf volatile monoterpenes sesquiterpenes methyl salicylate case nondetectable noninfested leaf increased strongly increasing spread infection the moderate reduction aa resulted loss photosynthetically active biomass reduction constitutive isoprene emission increase induced volatile emission primarily reflected change activity corresponding biochemical pathway although physiological alteration fungal infected leaf occurred stress severity dependent manner modification primary secondary metabolic pathway scaled differently due contrasting operational mechanism,low
310,SlMYC1 Regulates Type VI Glandular Trichome Formation and Terpene Biosynthesis in Tomato Glandular Cells,"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) glandular trichomes function as biochemical factories that synthesize a diverse array of specialized metabolites. Terpenoids are the most diverse class of plant specialized metabolites, with volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes playing important roles in plant defense. Although the biosynthetic pathways of volatile terpenes in tomato glandular trichomes have been well described, little is known about their regulation. Here, we demonstrate that SlMYC1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, differentially regulates mono- and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in the type VI glandular trichomes of tomato leaves and stems. SlMYC1 functions as a positive regulator of monoterpene biosynthesis in both leaf and stem trichomes but as a negative regulator of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in stem trichomes. SlMYC1 is also essential for type VI glandular trichome development, as knocking down SlMYC1 led to the production of smaller type VI glandular trichomes at lower densities, and knocking out this gene led to their absence. Our findings reveal a role for SlMYC1 not only in type VI glandular trichome development but also in the regulation of terpene biosynthesis in tomato.",tomato solanum lycopersicum glandular trichomes function biochemical factory synthesize diverse array specialized metabolite terpenoids diverse class plant specialized metabolite volatile mono sesquiterpenes playing important role plant defense although biosynthetic pathway volatile terpene tomato glandular trichomes well described little known regulation here demonstrate slmyc basic helix loop helix transcription factor differentially regulates mono sesquiterpene biosynthesis type vi glandular trichomes tomato leaf stem slmyc function positive regulator monoterpene biosynthesis leaf stem trichomes negative regulator sesquiterpene biosynthesis stem trichomes slmyc also essential type vi glandular trichome development knocking slmyc led production smaller type vi glandular trichomes lower density knocking gene led absence our finding reveal role slmyc type vi glandular trichome development also regulation terpene biosynthesis tomato,medium
311,Structure of a Heterotetrameric Geranyl Pyrophosphate Synthase from Mint (Mentha piperita) Reveals Intersubunit Regulation  ,"Terpenes (isoprenoids), derived from isoprenyl pyrophosphates, are versatile natural compounds that act as metabolism mediators, plant volatiles, and ecological communicators. Divergent evolution of homomeric prenyltransferases (PTSs) has allowed PTSs to optimize their active-site pockets to achieve catalytic fidelity and diversity. Little is known about heteromeric PTSs, particularly the mechanisms regulating formation of specific products. Here, we report the crystal structure of the (LSU · SSU)2-type (LSU/SSU = large/small subunit) heterotetrameric geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) from mint (Mentha piperita). The LSU and SSU of mint GPPS are responsible for catalysis and regulation, respectively, and this SSU lacks the essential catalytic amino acid residues found in LSU and other PTSs. Whereas no activity was detected for individually expressed LSU or SSU, the intact (LSU · SSU)2 tetramer produced not only C10-GPP at the beginning of the reaction but also C20-GGPP (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) at longer reaction times. The activity for synthesizing C10-GPP and C20-GGPP, but not C15-farnesyl pyrophosphate, reflects a conserved active-site structure of the LSU and the closely related mustard (Sinapis alba) homodimeric GGPPS. Furthermore, using a genetic complementation system, we showed that no C20-GGPP is produced by the mint GPPS in vivo. Presumably through protein–protein interactions, the SSU remodels the active-site cavity of LSU for synthesizing C10-GPP, the precursor of volatile C10-monoterpenes.",terpenes isoprenoids derived isoprenyl pyrophosphate versatile natural compound act metabolism mediator plant volatile ecological communicator divergent evolution homomeric prenyltransferases ptss allowed ptss optimize active site pocket achieve catalytic fidelity diversity little known heteromeric ptss particularly mechanism regulating formation specific product here report crystal structure lsu ssu type lsu ssu large small subunit heterotetrameric geranyl pyrophosphate synthase gpps mint mentha piperita the lsu ssu mint gpps responsible catalysis regulation respectively ssu lack essential catalytic amino acid residue found lsu ptss whereas activity detected individually expressed lsu ssu intact lsu ssu tetramer produced c gpp beginning reaction also c ggpp geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate longer reaction time the activity synthesizing c gpp c ggpp c farnesyl pyrophosphate reflects conserved active site structure lsu closely related mustard sinapis alba homodimeric ggpps furthermore using genetic complementation system showed c ggpp produced mint gpps vivo presumably protein protein interaction ssu remodels active site cavity lsu synthesizing c gpp precursor volatile c monoterpenes,low
312,Terpene Biosynthesis in Red Algae Is Catalyzed by Microbial Type But Not Typical Plant Terpene Synthases,"Red algae (Rhodophyta) and land plants belong to the monophyletic clade Archaeplastida, and taxa of both groups are rich producers of terpene secondary metabolites. The terpene carbon skeletons of land plants are made by two types of terpene synthases: typical plant terpene synthases and microbial-type terpene synthases (MTPSLs); however, terpene biosynthesis in red algae is poorly understood. By systematic sequence analysis of seven genomes and 34 transcriptomes of red algae, MTPSL homologs were identified within one genome and two transcriptomes, whereas no homolog of typical plant terpene synthase genes was found. Phylogenetic analysis showed that red algae MTPSLs group with bacterial terpene synthases. Analysis of the genome assembly and characterization of neighboring genes demonstrated red algal MTPSLs to be bona fide red algal genes and not microbial contaminants. MTPSL genes from Porphyridium purpureum and Erythrolobus australicus were characterized via heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and demonstrated to have sesquiterpene synthase activities. We detected a number of volatile sesquiterpenes in the headspace of P. purpureum and E. australicus cultures, most identical to the in vitro products of the respective MTPSLs. Expression of the MTPSL gene in P. purpureum was found to be induced by methyl jasmonate, suggesting a role for this gene in host defense. In summary, this study indicates that the formation of terpene carbon skeletons in red algae is carried out by MTPSLs that are phylogenetically unrelated to typical plant terpene synthases and most likely originated in Rhodophyta via horizontal gene transfer from bacteria.",red algae rhodophyta land plant belong monophyletic clade archaeplastida taxon group rich producer terpene secondary metabolite the terpene carbon skeleton land plant made two type terpene synthases typical plant terpene synthases microbial type terpene synthases mtpsls however terpene biosynthesis red algae poorly understood by systematic sequence analysis seven genome transcriptomes red algae mtpsl homologs identified within one genome two transcriptomes whereas homolog typical plant terpene synthase gene found phylogenetic analysis showed red algae mtpsls group bacterial terpene synthases analysis genome assembly characterization neighboring gene demonstrated red algal mtpsls bona fide red algal gene microbial contaminant mtpsl gene porphyridium purpureum erythrolobus australicus characterized via heterologous expression escherichia coli demonstrated sesquiterpene synthase activity we detected number volatile sesquiterpenes headspace p purpureum e australicus culture identical vitro product respective mtpsls expression mtpsl gene p purpureum found induced methyl jasmonate suggesting role gene host defense in summary study indicates formation terpene carbon skeleton red algae carried mtpsls phylogenetically unrelated typical plant terpene synthases likely originated rhodophyta via horizontal gene transfer bacteria,low
313,Terpene Down-Regulation Triggers Defense Responses in Transgenic Orange Leading to Resistance against Fungal Pathogens  ,"Terpenoid volatiles are isoprene compounds that are emitted by plants to communicate with the environment. In addition to their function in repelling herbivores and attracting carnivorous predators in green tissues, the presumed primary function of terpenoid volatiles released from mature fruits is the attraction of seed-dispersing animals. Mature oranges (Citrus sinensis) primarily accumulate terpenes in peel oil glands, with D-limonene accounting for approximately 97% of the total volatile terpenes. In a previous report, we showed that down-regulation of a D-limonene synthase gene alters monoterpene levels in orange antisense (AS) fruits, leading to resistance against Penicillium digitatum infection. A global gene expression analysis of AS versus empty vector (EV) transgenic fruits revealed that the down-regulation of D-limonene up-regulated genes involved in the innate immune response. Basal levels of jasmonic acid were substantially higher in the EV compared with AS oranges. Upon fungal challenge, salicylic acid levels were triggered in EV samples, while jasmonic acid metabolism and signaling were drastically increased in AS orange peels. In nature, D-limonene levels increase in orange fruit once the seeds are fully viable. The inverse correlation between the increase in D-limonene content and the decrease in the defense response suggests that D-limonene promotes infection by microorganisms that are likely involved in facilitating access to the pulp for seed-dispersing frugivores.",terpenoid volatile isoprene compound emitted plant communicate environment in addition function repelling herbivore attracting carnivorous predator green tissue presumed primary function terpenoid volatile released mature fruit attraction seed dispersing animal mature orange citrus sinensis primarily accumulate terpene peel oil gland d limonene accounting approximately total volatile terpene in previous report showed regulation d limonene synthase gene alters monoterpene level orange antisense as fruit leading resistance penicillium digitatum infection a global gene expression analysis as versus empty vector ev transgenic fruit revealed regulation d limonene regulated gene involved innate immune response basal level jasmonic acid substantially higher ev compared as orange upon fungal challenge salicylic acid level triggered ev sample jasmonic acid metabolism signaling drastically increased as orange peel in nature d limonene level increase orange fruit seed fully viable the inverse correlation increase d limonene content decrease defense response suggests d limonene promotes infection microorganism likely involved facilitating access pulp seed dispersing frugivores,low

315,The Arabidopsis thaliana Type I Isopentenyl Diphosphate Isomerases Are Targeted to Multiple Subcellular Compartments and Have Overlapping Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis,"To form the building blocks of isoprenoids, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) isomerase activity, which converts IPP to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), appears to be necessary in cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria. Arabidopsis thaliana contains only two IPP isomerases (Isopentenyl Diphosphate Isomerase1 [IDI1] and IDI2). Both encode proteins with N-terminal extensions similar to transit peptides and are expressed in all organs, with IDI1 less abundant than IDI2. Examination of enhanced green fluorescent protein fusions established that IDI1 is mainly in the plastid, whereas IDI2 is mainly in the mitochondria. Both proteins are also in the cytosol as a result of their translation from naturally occurring shorter transcripts lacking transit peptides, as demonstrated by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends cloning. IPP isomerase activity in the cytosol was confirmed by uniform labeling of IPP- and DMAPP-derived units of the cytoplasmic isoprenoid product, sitosterol, when labeled mevalonate was administered. Analysis of mutant lines showed that double mutants were nonviable, while homozygous single mutants had no major morphological or chemical differences from the wild type except for flowers with fused sepals and underdeveloped petals on idi2 mutants. Thus, each of the two Arabidopsis IPP isomerases is found in multiple but partially overlapping subcellular locations, and each can compensate for the loss of the other through partial redundancy in the cytosol.",to form building block isoprenoids isopentenyl diphosphate ipp isomerase activity convert ipp dimethylallyl diphosphate dmapp appears necessary cytosol plastid mitochondrion arabidopsis thaliana contains two ipp isomerase isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase idi idi both encode protein n terminal extension similar transit peptide expressed organ idi le abundant idi examination enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion established idi mainly plastid whereas idi mainly mitochondrion both protein also cytosol result translation naturally occurring shorter transcript lacking transit peptide demonstrated rapid amplification cdna end cloning ipp isomerase activity cytosol confirmed uniform labeling ipp dmapp derived unit cytoplasmic isoprenoid product sitosterol labeled mevalonate administered analysis mutant line showed double mutant nonviable homozygous single mutant major morphological chemical difference wild type except flower fused sepal underdeveloped petal idi mutant thus two arabidopsis ipp isomerase found multiple partially overlapping subcellular location compensate loss partial redundancy cytosol,low
316,The Biochemical and Molecular Basis for the Divergent Patterns in the Biosynthesis of Terpenes and Phenylpropenes in the Peltate Glands of Three Cultivars of Basil,"Surface glandular trichomes distributed throughout the aerial parts of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) produce and store monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and phenylpropene volatiles. Three distinct basil chemotypes were used to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the divergence in their monoterpene and sesquiterpene content. The relative levels of specific terpenes in the glandular trichomes of each cultivar were correlated with the levels of transcripts for eight genes encoding distinct terpene synthases. In a cultivar that produces mostly (R)-linalool, transcripts of (R)-linalool synthase (LIS) were the most abundant of these eight. In a cultivar that synthesizes mostly geraniol, transcripts of geraniol synthase were the most abundant, but the glands of this cultivar also contained a transcript of an (R)-LIS gene with a 1-base insertion that caused a frameshift mutation. A geraniol synthase-LIS hybrid gene was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein catalyzed the formation of both geraniol and (R)-linalool from geranyl diphosphate. The total amounts of terpenes were correlated with total levels of terpene synthase activities, and negatively correlated with levels of phenylpropanoids and phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity. The relative levels of geranyl diphosphate synthase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase activities did not correlate with the total amount of terpenes produced, but showed some correlation with the ratio of monoterpenes to sesquiterpenes.",surface glandular trichomes distributed throughout aerial part sweet basil ocimum basilicum produce store monoterpene sesquiterpene phenylpropene volatile three distinct basil chemotypes used examine molecular mechanism underlying divergence monoterpene sesquiterpene content the relative level specific terpene glandular trichomes cultivar correlated level transcript eight gene encoding distinct terpene synthases in cultivar produce mostly r linalool transcript r linalool synthase lis abundant eight in cultivar synthesizes mostly geraniol transcript geraniol synthase abundant gland cultivar also contained transcript r lis gene base insertion caused frameshift mutation a geraniol synthase lis hybrid gene constructed expressed escherichia coli protein catalyzed formation geraniol r linalool geranyl diphosphate the total amount terpene correlated total level terpene synthase activity negatively correlated level phenylpropanoids phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity the relative level geranyl diphosphate synthase farnesyl diphosphate synthase activity correlate total amount terpene produced showed correlation ratio monoterpenes sesquiterpenes,low
317,The Flavonoid Biosynthetic Enzyme Chalcone Isomerase Modulates Terpenoid Production in Glandular Trichomes of Tomato      ,"Flavonoids and terpenoids are derived from distinct metabolic pathways but nevertheless serve complementary roles in mediating plant interactions with the environment. Here, we show that glandular trichomes of the anthocyanin free (af) mutant of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fail to accumulate both flavonoids and terpenoids. This pleiotropic metabolic deficiency was associated with loss of resistance to native populations of coleopteran herbivores under field conditions. We demonstrate that Af encodes an isoform (SlCHI1) of the flavonoid biosynthetic enzyme chalcone isomerase (CHI), which catalyzes the conversion of naringenin chalcone to naringenin and is strictly required for flavonoid production in multiple tissues of tomato. Expression of the wild-type SlCHI1 gene from its native promoter complemented the anthocyanin deficiency in af. Unexpectedly, the SlCHI1 transgene also complemented the defect in terpenoid production in glandular trichomes. Our results establish a key role for SlCHI1 in flavonoid production in tomato and reveal a link between CHI1 and terpenoid production.

318,The floral transcriptome of ylang ylang (Cananga odorata var. fruticosa) uncovers biosynthetic pathways for volatile organic compounds and a multifunctional and novel sesquiterpene synthase,"The pleasant fragrance of ylang ylang varieties (Cananga odorata) is mainly due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the flowers. Floral scents are a key factor in plant–insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to ß-thujene, sabinene, ß-pinene, and a-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate. The other two TPSs were identified as sesqui-TPSs. CoTPS3 catalysed the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to a-bergamotene, whereas CoTPS2 was found to be a multifunctional and novel TPS that could catalyse the synthesis of three sesquiterpenes, ß-ylangene, ß-copaene, and ß-cubebene.

319,"The Maize Gene terpene synthase 1 Encodes a Sesquiterpene Synthase Catalyzing the Formation of (E)-ß-Farnesene, (E)-Nerolidol, and (E,E)-Farnesol after Herbivore Damage","Maize (Zea mays) emits a mixture of volatile compounds upon attack by the Egyptian cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis). These substances, primarily mono- and sesquiterpenes, are used by parasitic wasps to locate the lepidopteran larvae, which are their natural hosts. This interaction among plant, lepidopteran larvae, and hymenopteran parasitoids benefits the plant and has been termed indirect defense. The committed step in the biosynthesis of the different skeletal types of mono- and sesquiterpenes is catalyzed by terpene synthases, a class of enzymes that forms a large variety of mono- and sesquiterpene products from prenyl diphosphate precursors. We isolated a terpene synthase gene,terpene synthase 1 (tps1), from maize that exhibits only a low degree of sequence identity to previously identified terpene synthases. Upon expression in a bacterial system, the encoded enzyme produced the acyclic sesquiterpenes, (E)-ß-farnesene, (E,E)-farnesol, and (3R)-(E)-nerolidol, the last an intermediate in the formation of (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. Both (E)-ß-farnesene and (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene are prominent compounds of the maize volatile blend that is emitted after herbivore damage. The biochemical characteristics of the encoded enzyme are similar to those of terpene synthases from both gymnosperms and dicotyledonous angiosperms, suggesting that catalysis involves a similar electrophilic reaction mechanism.

We visualized in transformed Nicotiana tabacum Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells the geranylgeranylation and plasma membrane localization of GFP-BD-CVIL, which consists of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the C-terminal polybasic domain (BD) and CVIL isoprenylation motif from the Oryza sativa calmodulin, CaM61. Treatment with fosmidomycin (Fos) or oxoclomazone (OC), inhibitors of the plastidial 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, caused mislocalization of the protein to the nucleus, whereas treatment with mevinolin, an inhibitor of the cytosolic mevalonate pathway, did not. The nuclear localization of GFP-BD-CVIL in the presence of MEP pathway inhibitors was completely reversed by all-trans-geranylgeraniol (GGol). Furthermore, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose (DX) reversed the effects of OC, but not Fos, consistent with the hypothesis that OC blocks 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthesis, whereas Fos inhibits its conversion to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate. By contrast, GGol and DX did not rescue the nuclear mislocalization of GFP-BD-CVIL in the presence of a protein geranylgeranyltransferase type 1 inhibitor.

322,The Small Subunit of Snapdragon Geranyl Diphosphate Synthase Modifies the Chain Length Specificity of Tobacco Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Synthase in Planta,"Geranyl diphosphate (GPP), the precursor of many monoterpene end products, is synthesized in plastids by a condensation of dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) in a reaction catalyzed by homodimeric or heterodimeric GPP synthase (GPPS). In the heterodimeric enzymes, a noncatalytic small subunit (GPPS.SSU) determines the product specificity of the catalytic large subunit, which may be either an active geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) or an inactive GGPPS-like protein. Here, we show that expression of snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) GPPS.SSU in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants increased the total GPPS activity and monoterpene emission from leaves and flowers, indicating that the introduced catalytically inactive GPPS.SSU found endogenous large subunit partner(s) and formed an active snapdragon/tobacco GPPS in planta. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and in vitro enzyme analysis of individual and hybrid proteins revealed that two of four GGPPS-like candidates from tobacco EST databases encode bona fide GGPPS that can interact with snapdragon GPPS.SSU and form a functional GPPS enzyme in plastids. The formation of chimeric GPPS in transgenic plants also resulted in leaf chlorosis, increased light sensitivity, and dwarfism due to decreased levels of chlorophylls, carotenoids, and gibberellins. In addition, these transgenic plants had reduced levels of sesquiterpene emission, suggesting that the export of isoprenoid intermediates from the plastids into the cytosol was decreased. These results provide genetic evidence that GPPS.SSU modifies the chain length specificity of phylogenetically distant GGPPS and can modulate IPP flux distribution between GPP and GGPP synthesis in planta.",geranyl diphosphate gpp precursor many monoterpene end product synthesized plastid condensation dimethylallyl diphosphate isopentenyl diphosphate ipp reaction catalyzed homodimeric heterodimeric gpp synthase gpps in heterodimeric enzyme noncatalytic small subunit gpps ssu determines product specificity catalytic large subunit may either active geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase ggpps inactive ggpps like protein here show expression snapdragon antirrhinum majus gpps ssu tobacco nicotiana tabacum plant increased total gpps activity monoterpene emission leaf flower indicating introduced catalytically inactive gpps ssu found endogenous large subunit partner formed active snapdragon tobacco gpps planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation vitro enzyme analysis individual hybrid protein revealed two four ggpps like candidate tobacco est database encode bona fide ggpps interact snapdragon gpps ssu form functional gpps enzyme plastid the formation chimeric gpps transgenic plant also resulted leaf chlorosis increased light sensitivity dwarfism due decreased level chlorophyll carotenoid gibberellin in addition transgenic plant reduced level sesquiterpene emission suggesting export isoprenoid intermediate plastid cytosol decreased these result provide genetic evidence gpps ssu modifies chain length specificity phylogenetically distant ggpps modulate ipp flux distribution gpp ggpp synthesis planta,low
323,The Tomato Terpene Synthase Gene Family    ,"Compounds of the terpenoid class play numerous roles in the interactions of plants with their environment, such as attracting pollinators and defending the plant against pests. We show here that the genome of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) contains 44 terpene synthase (TPS) genes, including 29 that are functional or potentially functional. Of these 29 TPS genes, 26 were expressed in at least some organs or tissues of the plant. The enzymatic functions of eight of the TPS proteins were previously reported, and here we report the specific in vitro catalytic activity of 10 additional tomato terpene synthases. Many of the tomato TPS genes are found in clusters, notably on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10. All TPS family clades previously identified in angiosperms are also present in tomato. The largest clade of functional TPS genes found in tomato, with 12 members, is the TPS-a clade, and it appears to encode only sesquiterpene synthases, one of which is localized to the mitochondria, while the rest are likely cytosolic. A few additional sesquiterpene synthases are encoded by TPS-b clade genes. Some of the tomato sesquiterpene synthases use z,z-farnesyl diphosphate in vitro as well, or more efficiently than, the e,e-farnesyl diphosphate substrate. Genes encoding monoterpene synthases are also prevalent, and they fall into three clades: TPS-b, TPS-g, and TPS-e/f.

324,The Variability of Sesquiterpenes Emitted from Two Zea mays Cultivars Is Controlled by Allelic Variation of Two Terpene Synthase Genes Encoding Stereoselective Multiple Product Enzymes,"The mature leaves and husks of Zea mays release a complex blend of terpene volatiles after anthesis consisting predominantly of bisabolane-, sesquithujane-, and bergamotane-type sesquiterpenes. The varieties B73 and Delprim release the same volatile constituents but in significantly different proportions. To study the molecular genetic and biochemical mechanisms controlling terpene diversity and distribution in these varieties, we isolated the closely related terpene synthase genes terpene synthase4 (tps4) and tps5 from both varieties. The encoded enzymes, TPS4 and TPS5, each formed the same complex mixture of sesquiterpenes from the precursor farnesyl diphosphate but with different proportions of products. These mixtures correspond to the sesquiterpene blends observed in the varieties B73 and Delprim, respectively. The differences in the stereoselectivity of TPS4 and TPS5 are determined by four amino acid substitutions with the most important being a Gly instead of an Ala residue at position 409 at the catalytic site of the enzyme. Although both varieties contain tps4 and tps5 alleles, their differences in terpene composition result from the fact that B73 has only a single functional allele of tps4 and no functional alleles of tps5, whereas Delprim has only a functional allele of tps5 and no functional alleles of tps4. Lack of functionality was shown to be attributable to frame-shift mutations or amino acid substitutions that greatly reduce the activity of their encoded proteins. Therefore, the diversity of sesquiterpenes in these two maize cultivars is strongly influenced by single nucleotide changes in the alleles of two terpene synthase genes.",the mature leaf husk zea may release complex blend terpene volatile anthesis consisting predominantly bisabolane sesquithujane bergamotane type sesquiterpenes the variety b delprim release volatile constituent significantly different proportion to study molecular genetic biochemical mechanism controlling terpene diversity distribution variety isolated closely related terpene synthase gene terpene synthase tps tps variety the encoded enzyme tps tps formed complex mixture sesquiterpenes precursor farnesyl diphosphate different proportion product these mixture correspond sesquiterpene blend observed variety b delprim respectively the difference stereoselectivity tps tps determined four amino acid substitution important gly instead ala residue position catalytic site enzyme although variety contain tps tps allele difference terpene composition result fact b single functional allele tps functional allele tps whereas delprim functional allele tps functional allele tps lack functionality shown attributable frame shift mutation amino acid substitution greatly reduce activity encoded protein therefore diversity sesquiterpenes two maize cultivar strongly influenced single nucleotide change allele two terpene synthase gene,low
325,Two terpene synthases are responsible for the major sesquiterpenes emitted from the flowers of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa),"Kiwifruit vines rely on bees for pollen transfer between spatially separated male and female individuals and require synchronized flowering to ensure pollination. Volatile terpene compounds, which are important cues for insect pollinator attraction, were studied by dynamic headspace sampling in the major green-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) cultivar ‘Hayward’ and its male pollinator ‘Chieftain’. Terpene volatile levels showed a profile dominated by the sesquiterpenes a-farnesene and germacrene D. These two compounds were emitted by all floral tissues and could be observed throughout the day, with lower levels at night. The monoterpene (E)-ß-ocimene was also detected in flowers but was emitted predominantly during the day and only from petal tissue. Using a functional genomics approach, two terpene synthase (TPS) genes were isolated from a ‘Hayward’ petal EST library. Bacterial expression and transient in planta data combined with analysis by enantioselective gas chromatography revealed that one TPS produced primarily (E,E)-a-farnesene and small amounts of (E)-ß-ocimene, whereas the second TPS produced primarily (+)-germacrene D. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions showed that both enzymes were localized in the cytoplasm, the site for sesquiterpene production. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that both TPS genes were expressed in the same tissues and at the same times as the corresponding floral volatiles.

326,"Variation of Herbivore-Induced Volatile Terpenes among Arabidopsis Ecotypes Depends on Allelic Differences and Subcellular Targeting of Two Terpene Synthases, TPS02 and TPS03    ","When attacked by insects, plants release mixtures of volatile compounds that are beneficial for direct or indirect defense. Natural variation of volatile emissions frequently occurs between and within plant species, but knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms is limited. We investigated intraspecific differences of volatile emissions induced from rosette leaves of 27 accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) upon treatment with coronalon, a jasmonate mimic eliciting responses similar to those caused by insect feeding. Quantitative variation was found for the emission of the monoterpene (E)-ß-ocimene, the sesquiterpene (E,E)-a-farnesene, the irregular homoterpene 4,8,12-trimethyltridecatetra-1,3,7,11-ene, and the benzenoid compound methyl salicylate. Differences in the relative emissions of (E)-ß-ocimene and (E,E)-a-farnesene from accession Wassilewskija (Ws), a high-(E)-ß-ocimene emitter, and accession Columbia (Col-0), a trace-(E)-ß-ocimene emitter, were attributed to allelic variation of two closely related, tandem-duplicated terpene synthase genes, TPS02 and TPS03. The Ws genome contains a functional allele of TPS02 but not of TPS03, while the opposite is the case for Col-0. Recombinant proteins of the functional Ws TPS02 and Col-0 TPS03 genes both showed (E)-ß-ocimene and (E,E)-a-farnesene synthase activities. However, differential subcellular compartmentalization of the two enzymes in plastids and the cytosol was found to be responsible for the ecotype-specific differences in (E)-ß-ocimene/(E,E)-a-farnesene emission. Expression of the functional TPS02 and TPS03 alleles is induced in leaves by elicitor and insect treatment and occurs constitutively in floral tissues.

328,A Sesquiterpene Synthase from the Endophytic Fungus Serendipita indica Catalyzes Formation of Viridiflorol,"
Interactions between plant-associated fungi and their hosts are characterized by a continuous crosstalk of chemical molecules. Specialized metabolites are often produced during these associations and play important roles in the symbiosis between the plant and the fungus, as well as in the establishment of additional interactions between the symbionts and other organisms present in the niche. Serendipita indica, a root endophytic fungus from the phylum Basidiomycota, is able to colonize a wide range of plant species, conferring many benefits to its hosts. The genome of S. indica possesses only few genes predicted to be involved in specialized metabolite biosynthesis, including a putative terpenoid synthase gene (SiTPS). In our experimental setup, SiTPS expression was upregulated when the fungus colonized tomato roots compared to its expression in fungal biomass growing on synthetic medium. Heterologous expression of SiTPS in Escherichia coli showed that the produced protein catalyzes the synthesis of a few sesquiterpenoids, with the alcohol viridiflorol being the main product. To investigate the role of SiTPS in the plant-endophyte interaction, an SiTPS-over-expressing mutant line was created and assessed for its ability to colonize tomato roots. Although overexpression of SiTPS did not lead to improved fungal colonization ability, an in vitro growth-inhibition assay showed that viridiflorol has antifungal properties. Addition of viridiflorol to the culture medium inhibited the germination of spores from a phytopathogenic fungus, indicating that SiTPS and its products could provide S. indica with a competitive advantage over other plant-associated fungi during root colonization.

329,Advances in Fruit Aroma Volatile Research,"
Fruits produce a range of volatile compounds that make up their characteristic aromas and contribute to their flavor. Fruit volatile compounds are mainly comprised of esters, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, terpenoids and apocarotenoids. Many factors affect volatile composition, including the genetic makeup, degree of maturity, environmental conditions, postharvest handling and storage. There are several pathways involved in volatile biosynthesis starting from lipids, amino acids, terpenoids and carotenoids. Once the basic skeletons are produced via these pathways, the diversity of volatiles is achieved via additional modification reactions such as acylation, methylation, oxidation/reduction and cyclic ring closure. In this paper, we review the composition of fruit aroma, the characteristic aroma compounds of several representative fruits, the factors affecting aroma volatile, and the biosynthetic pathways of volatile aroma compounds. We anticipate that this review would provide some critical information for profound research on fruit aroma components and their manipulation during development and storage.

330,Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation of Chrysanthemum with Artemisinin Biosynthesis Pathway Genes,"
Artemisinin-based drugs are the most effective medicine for the malaria treatment. To date, the main method of artemisinin production is its extraction from wormwood plants Artemisia annua L. Due to the limitation of this source, considerable efforts are now directed to the development of methods for artemisinin production using heterologous expression systems. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone, synthesized through the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate involved in other sesquiterpene biosynthetic systems. Chrysanthemum species as well as A. annua, belong to Asteraceae family, and had been characterized by containing highly content of sesquiterpenes and their precursors. This makes chrysanthemum a promising target for the production of artemisinin in heterologous host plants. Chrysanthemum (C. morifolium Ramat.) was transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying with the binary vectors p1240 and p1250, bearing artemisinin biosynthesis genes coding: amorpha-4,11-diene synthase, artemisinic aldehyde ?11(13) reductase, amorpha-4,11-diene monooxygenase (p1240 was targeted to the mitochondria and p1250 was targeted to the cytosol), cytochrome P450 reductase from A. annua, as well as yeast truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase. This study obtained 8 kanamycin-resistant lines after transformation with the p1240 and 2 lines from p1250. All target genes were detected in 2 and 1 transgenic lines of the 2 vectors. The transformation frequency of all target genes were 0.33% and 0.17% for p1240 and p1250, relative to the total transformed explant numbers. RT-PCR analysis revealed the transcription of all transferred genes in two lines obtained after transformation with the p1240 vector, confirming the possibility of transferring genetic modules encoding entire biochemical pathways into the chrysanthemum genome. This holds promise for the development of a chrysanthemum-based expression system to produce non-protein substances, such as artemisinin.

Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites using phytochemical and transcriptomic approaches to understand the mechanisms of scents biosynthesis, especially terpenoid in Hoya. Three Hoya flower species were selected in this study: Hoya cagayanensis, Hoya lacunosa, and Hoya coriacea. The secondary metabolite profiles characterizing scents on flowers were performed using head space solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed 23 compounds from H. cagayanensis, 14 from H. lacunose, and 36 from H. coriacea. Volatiles from the three species had different fragrance profiles, with ß-ocimene and methyl salicylate compounds dominating the odor in H. cagayanensis. The 1-octane-3-ol was found highest in H. lacunosa, and (Z)-acid butyric, 3-hexenyl ester was found highest in H. coriacea. Subsequent studies were conducted to identify the biosynthesis pathway of secondary metabolites responsible for the aroma profile released by Hoya flowers through transcriptome sequencing using the Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform. A total of 109,240 (75.84%) unigenes in H. cagayanensis, 42,479 (69.00%) in H. lacunosa and 72,610 (70.55%) in H. coriacea of the total unigenes were successfully annotated using public databases such as NCBI-Nr, KEGG, InterPro, and Gene Ontology (GO).

Floral volatile terpenoids (FVTs) belong to a group of volatile organic compounds (VOC) that play important roles in attracting pollinators, defending against pathogens and parasites and serving as signals associated with biotic and abiotic stress responses. Although research on FVTs has been increasing, a systematic generalization is lacking. Among flowering plants used mainly for ornamental purposes, a systematic study on the production of FVTs in flowers with characteristic aromas is still limited. This paper reviews the biological functions and biosynthesis of FVTs, which may contribute a foundational aspect for future research. We highlight regulatory mechanisms that control the production of FVTs in ornamental flowers and the intersection of biosynthetic pathways that produce flower fragrance and color. Additionally, we summarize the opportunities and challenges facing FVT research in the whole genome and -omics eras and the possible research directions that will provide a foundation for further innovation and utilization of flowering ornamental plants and their germplasm resources.

333,Biochemical Characterization and Function of Eight Microbial Type Terpene Synthases from Lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii,"
Selaginella moellendorffii is a lycophyte, a member of an ancient vascular plant lineage. Two distinct types of terpene synthase (TPS) genes were identified from this species, including S. moellendorffii TPS genes (SmTPSs) and S. moellendorffii microbial TPS-like genes (SmMTPSLs). The goal of this study was to investigate the biochemical functions of SmMTPSLs. Here, eight full-length SmMTPSL genes (SmMTPSL5, -15, -19, -23, -33, -37, -46, and -47) were functionally characterized from S. moellendorffii. Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant SmMTPSLs were tested for monoterpenes synthase and sesquiterpenes synthase activities. These enzymatic products were typical monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that have been previous shown to be generated by typical plant TPSs when provided with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrates. Meanwhile, SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 were up-regulated when induced by alamethicin (ALA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), suggesting a role for these genes in plants response to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, this study pointed out that the terpenoids products of SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 have an antibacterial effect on Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and Staphylococcus aureus. Taken together, these results provide more information about the catalytic and biochemical function of SmMTPSLs in S. moellendorffii plants.

334,Terpenoid Metabolic Engineering in Photosynthetic Microorganisms,"
Terpenoids are a group of natural products that have a variety of roles, both essential and non-essential, in metabolism and in biotic and abiotic interactions, as well as commercial applications such as pharmaceuticals, food additives, and chemical feedstocks. Economic viability for commercial applications is commonly not achievable by using natural source organisms or chemical synthesis. Engineered bio-production in suitable heterologous hosts is often required to achieve commercial viability. However, our poor understanding of regulatory mechanisms and other biochemical processes makes obtaining efficient conversion yields from feedstocks challenging. Moreover, production from carbon dioxide via photosynthesis would significantly increase the environmental and potentially the economic credentials of these processes by disintermediating biomass feedstocks. In this paper, we briefly review terpenoid metabolism, outline some recent advances in terpenoid metabolic engineering, and discuss why photosynthetic unicellular organisms—such as algae and cyanobacteria—might be preferred production platforms for the expression of some of the more challenging terpenoid pathways

335,Terpenoids and Their Biosynthesis in Cyanobacteria,"
Terpenoids, or isoprenoids, are a family of compounds with great structural diversity which are essential for all living organisms. In cyanobacteria, they are synthesized from the methylerythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway, using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate produced by photosynthesis as substrates. The products of the MEP pathway are the isomeric five-carbon compounds isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, which in turn form the basic building blocks for formation of all terpenoids. Many terpenoid compounds have useful properties and are of interest in the fields of pharmaceuticals and nutrition, and even potentially as future biofuels. The MEP pathway, its function and regulation, and the subsequent formation of terpenoids have not been fully elucidated in cyanobacteria, despite its relevance for biotechnological applications. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge about cyanobacterial terpenoid biosynthesis, both regarding the native metabolism and regarding metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria for heterologous production of non-native terpenoids.

The phytochemistry of A. annua is dominated by both sesquiterpenoids and flavonoids, as is the case for many other plants in the Asteraceae family. However, A. annua is distinguished from the other members of the family both by the very large number of natural products which have been characterised to date (almost six hundred in total, including around fifty amorphane and cadinane sesquiterpenes), and by the highly oxygenated nature of many of the terpenoidal secondary metabolites. In addition, this species also contains an unusually large number of terpene allylic hydroperoxides and endoperoxides. This observation forms the basis of a proposal that the biogenesis of many of the highly oxygenated terpene metabolites from A. annua – including artemisinin itself – may proceed by spontaneous oxidation reactions of terpene precursors, which involve these highly reactive allyllic hydroperoxides as intermediates. Although several studies of the biosynthesis of artemisinin have been reported in the literature from the 1980s and early 1990s, the collective results from these studies were rather confusing because they implied that an unfeasibly large number of different sesquiterpenes could all function as direct precursors to artemisinin (and some of the experiments also appeared to contradict one another). As a result, the complete biosynthetic pathway to artemisinin could not be stated conclusively at the time. Fortunately, studies which have been published in the last decade are now providing a clearer picture of the biosynthetic pathways in A. annua. By synthesising some of the sesquiterpene natural products which have been proposed as biogenetic precursors to artemisinin in such a way that they incorporate a stable isotopic label, and then feeding these precursors to intact A. annua plants, it has now been possible to demonstrate that dihydroartemisinic acid is a late-stage precursor to artemisinin and that the closely related secondary metabolite, artemisinic acid, is not (this approach differs from all the previous studies, which used radio-isotopically labelled precursors that were fed to a plant homogenate or a cell-free preparation). Quite remarkably, feeding experiments with labeled dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinic acid have resulted in incorporation of label into roughly half of all the amorphane and cadinane sesquiterpenes which were already known from phytochemical studies of A. annua. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that many of the highly oxygenated sesquiterpenoids from this species arise by oxidation reactions involving allylic hydroperoxides, which seem to be such a defining feature of the chemistry of A. annua. In the particular case of artemisinin, these in vivo results are also supported by in vitro studies, demonstrating explicitly that the biosynthesis of artemisinin proceeds via the tertiary allylic hydroperoxide, which is derived from oxidation of dihydroartemisinic acid. There is some evidence that the autoxidation of dihydroartemisinic acid to this tertiary allylic hydroperoxide is a non-enzymatic process within the plant, requiring only the presence of light; and, furthermore, that the series of spontaneous rearrangement reactions which then convert this allylic hydroperoxide to the 1,2,4-trioxane ring of artemisinin are also non-enzymatic in nature.

337,The Complexity of Sesquiterpene Chemistry Dictates Its Pleiotropic Biologic Effects on Inflammation,"
Sesquiterpenes (SQs) are volatile compounds made by plants, insects, and marine organisms. SQ have a large range of biological properties and are potent inhibitors and modulators of inflammation, targeting specific components of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-?B) signaling pathway and nitric oxide (NO) generation. Because SQs can be isolated from over 1600 genera and 2500 species grown worldwide, they are an attractive source of phytochemical therapeutics. The chemical structure and biosynthesis of SQs is complex, and the SQ scaffold represents extraordinary structural variety consisting of both acyclic and cyclic (mono, bi, tri, and tetracyclic) compounds. These structures can be decorated with a diverse range of functional groups and substituents, generating many stereospecific configurations. In this review, the effect of SQs on inflammation will be discussed in the context of their complex chemistry. Because inflammation is a multifactorial process, we focus on specific aspects of inflammation: the inhibition of NF-kB signaling, disruption of NO production and modulation of dendritic cells, mast cells, and monocytes. Although the molecular targets of SQs are varied, we discuss how these pathways may mediate the effects of SQs on inflammation.

338,The Uncertain Role of Biogenic VOC for Boundary-Layer Ozone Concentration: Example Investigation of Emissions from Two Forest Types with a Box Model,"
High levels of air pollution including ground level ozone significantly reduce humans’ life expectancy and cause forest damage and decreased tree growth. The French Vosges and the German Black Forest are regions well-known for having the highest tropospheric ozone concentrations at remote forested sites in Central Europe. This box model study investigates the sensitivity of atmospheric chemistry calculations of derived ozone on differently resolved forest tree composition and volatile organic compound emissions. Representative conditions were chosen for the Upper Rhine area including the Alsatian Vosges/France and the Black Forest/Germany during summer. This study aims to answer the following question: What level of input detail for Alsace and Black Forest tree mixtures is required to accurately simulate ozone formation? While the French forest in Alsace—e.g., in the Vosges—emits isoprene to a substantially higher extent than the forest at the German site, total monoterpene emissions at the two sites are rather similar. However, the individual monoterpene structures, and therefore their reactivity, differs. This causes a higher ozone production rate for Vosges forest mixture conditions than for Black Forest tree mixtures at identical NOx levels, with the difference increasing with temperature. The difference in ozone formation is analyzed in detail and the short-comings of reduced descriptions are discussed. The outcome serves as a to-do-list to allow accurate future ozone predictions influenced by the climate adaptation of forests and the change in forest species composition.

339,Therapeutic Potential of Volatile Terpenes and Terpenoids from Forests for Inflammatory Diseases,"
Forest trees are a major source of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Terpenes and terpenoids are known as the main BVOCs of forest aerosols. These compounds have been shown to display a broad range of biological activities in various human disease models, thus implying that forest aerosols containing these compounds may be related to beneficial effects of forest bathing. In this review, we surveyed studies analyzing BVOCs and selected the most abundant 23 terpenes and terpenoids emitted in forested areas of the Northern Hemisphere, which were reported to display anti-inflammatory activities. We categorized anti-inflammatory processes related to the functions of these compounds into six groups and summarized their molecular mechanisms of action. Finally, among the major 23 compounds, we examined the therapeutic potentials of 12 compounds known to be effective against respiratory inflammation, atopic dermatitis, arthritis, and neuroinflammation among various inflammatory diseases. In conclusion, the updated studies support the beneficial effects of forest aerosols and propose their potential use as chemopreventive and therapeutic agents for treating various inflammatory diseases.

340,Tissue-Specific Expression of the Terpene Synthase Family Genes in Rosa chinensis and Effect of Abiotic Stress Conditions,"
Rose (Rosa chinensis) is one of the most famous ornamental plants worldwide, with a variety of colors and fragrances. Terpene synthases (TPSs) play critical roles in the biosynthesis of terpenes. In this work, we report a comprehensive study on the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TPS family in R. chinensis. We identified 49 TPS genes in the R. chinensis genome, and they were grouped into five subfamilies (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, TPS-g and TPS-e/f). Phylogenetics, gene structure and conserved motif analyses indicated that the RcTPS genes possessed relatively conserved gene structures and the RcTPS proteins contained relatively conserved motifs. Multiple putative cis-acting elements involved in the stress response were identified in the promoter region of RcTPS genes, suggesting that some could be regulated by stress. The expression profile of RcTPS genes showed that they were predominantly expressed in the petals of open flowers, pistils, leaves and roots. Under osmotic and heat stresses, the expression of most RcTPS genes was upregulated. These data provide a useful foundation for deciphering the functional roles of RcTPS genes during plant growth as well as addressing the link between terpene biosynthesis and abiotic stress responses in roses.

341,Transcriptome and Metabolome Dynamics Explain Aroma Differences between Green and Red Prickly Ash Fruit,"
Green prickly ash (Zanthoxylum armatum) and red prickly ash (Zanthoxylum bungeanum) fruit have unique flavor and aroma characteristics that affect consumers’ purchasing preferences. However, differences in aroma components and relevant biosynthesis genes have not been systematically investigated in green and red prickly ash. Here, through the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially abundant metabolites, and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, we characterize the different aroma components of green and red prickly ash fruits and identify key genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify 41 terpenoids from green prickly ash and 61 terpenoids from red prickly ash. Piperitone was the most abundant terpenoid in green prickly ash fruit, whereas limonene was most abundant in red prickly ash. Intergroup correlation analysis and redundancy analysis showed that HDS2, MVK2, and MVD are key genes for terpenoid synthesis in green prickly ash, whereas FDPS2 and FDPS3 play an important role in the terpenoid synthesis of red prickly ash. In summary, differences in the composition and content of terpenoids are the main factors that cause differences in the aromas of green and red prickly ash, and these differences reflect contrasting expression patterns of terpenoid synthesis genes.

342,Traps and Pitfalls—Unspecific Reactions in Metabolic Engineering of Sesquiterpenoid Pathways,"
The characterization of plant enzymes by expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic (yeast and plants) heterologous hosts has widely been used in recent decades to elucidate metabolic pathways in plant secondary metabolism. Yeast and plant systems provide the cellular environment of a eukaryotic cell and the subcellular compartmentalization necessary to facilitate enzyme function. The expression of candidate genes in these cell systems and the identification of the resulting products guide the way for the identification of enzymes with new functions. However, in many cases, the detected compounds are not the direct enzyme products but are caused by unspecific subsequent reactions. Even if the mechanisms for these unspecific reactions are in many cases widely reported, there is a lack of overview of potential reactions that may occur to provide a guideline for researchers working on the characterization of new enzymes. Here, an across-the-board summary of rearrangement reactions of sesquiterpenes in metabolic pathway engineering is presented. The different kinds of unspecific reactions as well as their chemical and cellular background are explained and strategies how to spot and how to avoid these unspecific reactions are given. Also, a systematic approach of classification of unspecific reactions is introduced. It is hoped that this mini-review will stimulate a discussion on how to systematically classify unspecific reactions in metabolic engineering and to expand this approach to other classes of plant secondary metabolites.

344,Volatile Metabolites,"
Volatile organic compounds (volatiles) comprise a chemically diverse class of low molecular weight organic compounds having an appreciable vapor pressure under ambient conditions. Volatiles produced by plants attract pollinators and seed dispersers, and provide defense against pests and pathogens. For insects, volatiles may act as pheromones directing social behavior or as cues for finding hosts or prey. For humans, volatiles are important as flavorants and as possible disease biomarkers. The marine environment is also a major source of halogenated and sulfur-containing volatiles which participate in the global cycling of these elements. While volatile analysis commonly measures a rather restricted set of analytes, the diverse and extreme physical properties of volatiles provide unique analytical challenges. Volatiles constitute only a small proportion of the total number of metabolites produced by living organisms, however, because of their roles as signaling molecules (semiochemicals) both within and between organisms, accurately measuring and determining the roles of these compounds is crucial to an integrated understanding of living systems. This review summarizes recent developments in volatile research from a metabolomics perspective with a focus on the role of recent technical innovation in developing new areas of volatile research and expanding the range of ecological interactions which may be mediated by volatile organic metabolites.

Twenty-one volatile terpenes and terpenoids were found in Monomorium chinense Santschi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a native Chinese ant, by using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas-phase chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which makes this ant one of the most prolific terpene producers in insect. A sesquiterpene with unknown structure (terpene 1) was the main terpene in workers and neocembrene in queens. Terpenes and terpenoids were detected in poison, Dufour’s and mandibular glands of both workers and queens. Worker ants raised on a terpene-free diet showed the same terpene profile as ants collected in the field, indicating that de novo terpene and terpenoid synthesis occurs in M. chinense.

346,Volatiles Emitted at Different Flowering Stages of Jasminum sambac and Expression of Genes Related to a-Farnesene Biosynthesis,"
Fresh jasmine flowers have been used to make jasmine teas in China, but there has been no complete information about volatile organic compound emissions in relation to flower developmental stages and no science-based knowledge about which floral stage should be used for the infusion. This study monitored volatile organic compounds emitted from living flowers of Jasminum sambac (L.) Ait. ‘Bifoliatum’ at five developmental stages and also from excised flowers. Among the compounds identified, a-farnesene, linalool, and benzyl acetate were most abundant. Since a-farnesene is synthesized through the Mevalonate pathway, four genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and terpene synthase were isolated. Their expression patterns in living flowers at the five stages and in excised flowers coincided with the emission patterns of a-farnesene. Application of lovastatin, a HMGR inhibitor, significantly reduced the expression of the genes and greatly decreased the emission of a-farnesene. The sweet scent was diminished from lovastatin-treated flowers as well. These results indicate that a-farnesene is an important compound emitted from jasmine flowers, and its emission patterns suggest that flowers at the opening stage or flower buds 8 h after excision should be used for the infusion of tea leaves.

347,Microbial Synthesis of Pinene,"The volumetric heating values of today’s biofuels are too low to power energy-intensive aircraft, rockets, and missiles. Recently, pinene dimers were shown to have a volumetric heating value similar to that of the tactical fuel JP-10. To provide a sustainable source of pinene, we engineered Escherichia coli for pinene production. We combinatorially expressed three pinene synthases (PS) and three geranyl diphosphate synthases (GPPS), with the best combination achieving ~28 mg/L of pinene. We speculated that pinene toxicity was limiting production; however, toxicity should not be limiting at current titers. Because GPPS is inhibited by geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and to increase flux through the pathway, we combinatorially constructed GPPS-PS protein fusions. The Abies grandis GPPS-PS fusion produced 32 mg/L of pinene, a 6-fold improvement over the highest titer previously reported in engineered E. coli. Finally, we investigated the pinene isomer ratio of our pinene-producing microbe and discovered that the isomer profile is determined not only by the identity of the PS used but also by the identity of the GPPS with which the PS is paired. We demonstrated that the GPP concentration available to PS for cyclization alters the pinene isomer ratio.",the volumetric heating value today biofuels low power energy intensive aircraft rocket missile recently pinene dimer shown volumetric heating value similar tactical fuel jp to provide sustainable source pinene engineered escherichia coli pinene production we combinatorially expressed three pinene synthases ps three geranyl diphosphate synthases gpps best combination achieving mg l pinene we speculated pinene toxicity limiting production however toxicity limiting current titer because gpps inhibited geranyl diphosphate gpp increase flux pathway combinatorially constructed gpps ps protein fusion the abies grandis gpps ps fusion produced mg l pinene fold improvement highest titer previously reported engineered e coli finally investigated pinene isomer ratio pinene producing microbe discovered isomer profile determined identity ps used also identity gpps ps paired we demonstrated gpp concentration available ps cyclization alters pinene isomer ratio,low
348,Pathway-Based Metabolomics Analysis Reveals Biosynthesis of Key Flavor Compounds in Mango,"Mango is a tropical fruit with global demand as a result of its high sensory quality and nutritional attributes. Improving fruit quality at the consumer level could increase demand, but fruit quality is a complex trait requiring a deep understanding of flavor development to uncover key pathways that could become targets for improving sensory quality. Here, a pathway-based metabolomics (untargeted and targeted) approach was used to explore biosynthetic mechanisms of key flavor compounds with five core metabolic pathways (butanoate metabolism, phenylalanine biosynthesis and metabolism, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, linoleic and linolenic acid pathway, and carbon fixation and sucrose metabolism) in three mango cultivars. The relationships between flavor precursors and flavor compounds were identified using correlation analysis. With these novel strategies, differentially regulated metabolic flux through the pathways was first elucidated, demonstrating possible mechanisms of key flavor formation and regulation in mango fruits.",mango tropical fruit global demand result high sensory quality nutritional attribute improving fruit quality consumer level could increase demand fruit quality complex trait requiring deep understanding flavor development uncover key pathway could become target improving sensory quality here pathway based metabolomics untargeted targeted approach used explore biosynthetic mechanism key flavor compound five core metabolic pathway butanoate metabolism phenylalanine biosynthesis metabolism terpenoid backbone biosynthesis linoleic linolenic acid pathway carbon fixation sucrose metabolism three mango cultivar the relationship flavor precursor flavor compound identified using correlation analysis with novel strategy differentially regulated metabolic flux pathway first elucidated demonstrating possible mechanism key flavor formation regulation mango fruit,high
349,Wounding-Induced VOC Emissions in Five Tropical Agricultural Species,"
Leaf mechanical wounding triggers a rapid release—within minutes—of a blend of volatile organic compounds. A wounding-induced VOC blend is mainly composed of oxygenated ubiquitous stress volatiles such as methanol and volatile products of lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway (mainly C5 and C6 alcohols and aldehydes and their derivatives), but also includes multiple minor VOCs that collectively act as infochemicals, inducing defences in non-damaged plant leaves and neighbouring plants and attracting herbivore enemies. At present, the interspecific variability of the rate of induction and magnitude of wounding-induced emissions and the extent to which plant structural traits and physiological activity alter these emissions are poorly known. Particularly scarce is information on the induced emissions in tropical agricultural plant species, despite their economic importance and large area of cultivation at regional and global scales. We chose five tropical crops with varying photosynthetic activity and leaf structural characteristics—Abelmoschus esculentus, Amaranthus cruentus, Amaranthus hybridus, Solanum aethiopicum, and Telfairia occidentalis—to characterize the kinetics and magnitude of wounding-induced emissions, hypothesizing that the induced emission response is greater and faster in physiologically more active species with greater photosynthetic activity than in less active species. Rapid highly repeatable leaf wounds (12 mm cuts) were generated by a within-leaf-chamber cutting knife. Wounding-induced VOC emissions were measured continuously with a proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer and gas-chromatography mass spectrometry was used to separate isomers. Twenty-three ion VOCs and twelve terpenoid molecule structures were identified, whereas ubiquitous stress volatiles methanol (on average 40% of total emissions), hexenal (24%), and acetaldehyde (11%) were the main compounds across the species. Emissions of low-weight oxygenated compounds (LOC, 70% of total) and LOX products (29%) were positively correlated across species, but minor VOC components, monoterpenoids and benzenoids, were negatively correlated with LOC and LOX, indicating a reverse relationship between signal specificity and strength. There was a large interspecific variability in the rate of induction and emission magnitude, but the hypothesis of a stronger emission response in physiologically more active species was only partly supported. In addition, the overall emission levels were somewhat lower with different emission blend compared to the data reported for wild species, as well as different shares for the VOCs in the blend. The study demonstrates that wounding-dependent emissions from tropical agricultural crops can significantly contribute to atmospheric volatiles, and these emissions cannot be predicted based on current evidence of wild plant model systems.

350,A unified mechanism of action for volatile isoprenoids in plant abiotic stress,"The sessile nature of plants has resulted in the evolution of an extraordinarily diverse suite of protective mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses. Though volatile isoprenoids are known to be involved in many types of biotic interactions, they also play important but relatively unappreciated roles in abiotic stress responses. We review those roles, discuss the proposed mechanistic explanations and examine the evolutionary significance of volatile isoprenoid emission. We note that abiotic stress responses generically involve production of reactive oxygen species in plant cells, and volatile isoprenoids mitigate the effects of oxidative stress by mediating the oxidative status of the plant. On the basis of these observations, we propose a 'single biochemical mechanism for multiple physiological stressors' model, whereby the protective effect against abiotic stress is exerted through direct or indirect improvement in resistance to damage by reactive oxygen species.",the sessile nature plant resulted evolution extraordinarily diverse suite protective mechanism biotic abiotic stress though volatile isoprenoids known involved many type biotic interaction also play important relatively unappreciated role abiotic stress response we review role discus proposed mechanistic explanation examine evolutionary significance volatile isoprenoid emission we note abiotic stress response generically involve production reactive oxygen specie plant cell volatile isoprenoids mitigate effect oxidative stress mediating oxidative status plant on basis observation propose single biochemical mechanism multiple physiological stressor model whereby protective effect abiotic stress exerted direct indirect improvement resistance damage reactive oxygen specie,low
351,Redirection of cytosolic or plastidic isoprenoid precursors elevates terpene production in plants,"Terpenes constitute a distinct class of natural products1 that attract insects2, defend against phytopathogenic microbes3 and combat human diseases4. However, like most natural products, they are usually made by plants and microbes in small amounts and as complex mixtures. Chemical synthesis is often costly and inefficient, and may not yield enantiomerically pure terpenes, whereas large-scale microbial production requires expensive feedstocks. We engineered high-level terpene production in tobacco plants by diverting carbon flow from cytosolic or plastidic isopentenyl diphosphate through overexpression in either compartment of an avian farnesyl diphosphate synthase and an appropriate terpene synthase. Isotopic labeling studies suggest little, if any, metabolite exchange between these two subcellular compartments. The strategy increased synthesis of the sesquiterpenes patchoulol and amorpha-4,11-diene more than 1,000-fold, as well as the monoterpene limonene 10–30 fold, and seems equally suited to generating higher levels of other terpenes for research, industrial production or therapeutic applications.",terpenes constitute distinct class natural product attract insect defend phytopathogenic microbe combat human disease however like natural product usually made plant microbe small amount complex mixture chemical synthesis often costly inefficient may yield enantiomerically pure terpene whereas large scale microbial production requires expensive feedstock we engineered high level terpene production tobacco plant diverting carbon flow cytosolic plastidic isopentenyl diphosphate overexpression either compartment avian farnesyl diphosphate synthase appropriate terpene synthase isotopic labeling study suggest little metabolite exchange two subcellular compartment the strategy increased synthesis sesquiterpenes patchoulol amorpha diene fold well monoterpene limonene fold seems equally suited generating higher level terpene research industrial production therapeutic application,low

However, recent measurements indicate that further sources of volatiles are present. Here we show that soil microorganisms are a strong, unaccounted source of highly reactive and previously unreported sesquiterpenes (C15H24; SQT). The emission rate and chemical speciation of soil SQTs were determined as a function of soil moisture, oxygen, and rRNA transcript abundance in the laboratory. Based on these results, a model was developed to predict soil–atmosphere SQT fluxes. It was found SQT emissions from a Terra Firme soil in the dry season were in comparable magnitude to current global model canopy emissions, establishing an important ecological connection between soil microbes and atmospherically relevant SQTs.",the amazon rainforest world largest source reactive volatile isoprenoids atmosphere it generally assumed emission product photosynthetically driven secondary metabolism released rainforest canopy influence oxidative capacity atmosphere however recent measurement indicate source volatile present here show soil microorganism strong unaccounted source highly reactive previously unreported sesquiterpenes c h sqt the emission rate chemical speciation soil sqts determined function soil moisture oxygen rrna transcript abundance laboratory based result model developed predict soil atmosphere sqt flux it found sqt emission terra firme soil dry season comparable magnitude current global model canopy emission establishing important ecological connection soil microbe atmospherically relevant sqts,low
353,Studies on Biosynthetic Genes and Enzymes of Isoprenoids Produced by Actinomycetes,"Most Streptomyces strains are equipped with only the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway for the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate, a common precursor of isoprenoids. In addition to this pathway, some Streptomyces strains possess the mevalonate (MV) pathway via which isoprenoid antibiotics are produced. We have recently cloned and analyzed the MV pathway gene clusters and their flanking regions from terpentecin, BE-40644, and furaquinocin A producers. All these clusters contained genes coding for mevalonate kinase, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase, phosphomevalonate kinase, type 2 IPP isomerase, HMG-CoA reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase. The order of each of the open reading frames (ORFs) is also the same, and the respective homologous ORFs show more than 70% amino acid identity with each other. In contrast to these conservative gene organizations, the biosynthetic genes of terpentecin, BE-40644, and furaquinocin A were located just upstream and/or downstream of the MV pathway gene cluster. These facts suggested that all the actinomycete strains possessing both the MV and MEP pathways produce isoprenoid compounds and the biosynthetic genes of one of these isoprenoids usually exist adjacent to the MV pathway gene cluster. Therefore, when the presence of the MV cluster is detected by molecular genetic techniques, isoprenoids may be produced by the cultivation of these actinomycete strains. During the course of these studies, we identified diterpene cyclases possessing unique primary structures that differ from those of eukaryotes and catalyze unique reactions.",most streptomyces strain equipped c methyl d erythritol phosphate mep pathway formation isopentenyl diphosphate common precursor isoprenoids in addition pathway streptomyces strain posse mevalonate mv pathway via isoprenoid antibiotic produced we recently cloned analyzed mv pathway gene cluster flanking region terpentecin be furaquinocin a producer all cluster contained gene coding mevalonate kinase mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase phosphomevalonate kinase type ipp isomerase hmg coa reductase hmg coa synthase the order open reading frame orfs also respective homologous orfs show amino acid identity in contrast conservative gene organization biosynthetic gene terpentecin be furaquinocin a located upstream downstream mv pathway gene cluster these fact suggested actinomycete strain possessing mv mep pathway produce isoprenoid compound biosynthetic gene one isoprenoids usually exist adjacent mv pathway gene cluster therefore presence mv cluster detected molecular genetic technique isoprenoids may produced cultivation actinomycete strain during course study identified diterpene cyclases possessing unique primary structure differ eukaryote catalyze unique reaction,low
354,Volatile diterpene emission by two Mediterranean Cistaceae shrubs,"Mediterranean vegetation emits a wide range of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) among which isoprenoids present quantitatively the most important compound class. Here, we investigated the isoprenoid emission from two Mediterranean Cistaceae shrubs, Halimium halimifolium and Cistus ladanifer, under controlled and natural conditions, respectively. For the first time, diurnal emission patterns of the diterpene kaurene were detected in real-time by Proton-Transfer-Reaction-Time-of-Flight-Mass-Spectrometer. Kaurene emissions were strongly variable among H. halimifolium plants, ranging from 0.01?±?0.003 to 0.06?±?0.01 nmol m-2 s-1 in low and high emitting individuals, respectively. They were in the same order of magnitude as monoterpene (0.01?±?0.01 to 0.11?±?0.04 nmol m-2 s-1) and sesquiterpene (0.01?±?0.01 to 0.52 nmol m-2 s-1) emission rates. Comparable range and variability was found for C. ladanifer under natural conditions. Labelling with 13C-pyruvate suggested that emitted kaurene was not derived from de novo biosynthesis. The high kaurene content in leaves, the weak relationship with ecophysiological parameters and the tendency of higher emissions with increasing temperatures in the field indicate an emission from storage pools. This study highlights significant emissions of kaurene from two Mediterranean shrub species, indicating that the release of diterpenes into the atmosphere should probably deserve more attention in the future.",mediterranean vegetation emits wide range biogenic volatile organic compound bvocs among isoprenoids present quantitatively important compound class here investigated isoprenoid emission two mediterranean cistaceae shrub halimium halimifolium cistus ladanifer controlled natural condition respectively for first time diurnal emission pattern diterpene kaurene detected real time proton transfer reaction time flight mass spectrometer kaurene emission strongly variable among h halimifolium plant ranging nmol low high emitting individual respectively they order magnitude monoterpene nmol sesquiterpene nmol emission rate comparable range variability found c ladanifer natural condition labelling c pyruvate suggested emitted kaurene derived de novo biosynthesis the high kaurene content leaf weak relationship ecophysiological parameter tendency higher emission increasing temperature field indicate emission storage pool this study highlight significant emission kaurene two mediterranean shrub specie indicating release diterpenes atmosphere probably deserve attention future,low
355,Assembly-Line Catalysis in Bifunctional Terpene Synthases,"The magnificent chemodiversity of more than 95?000 terpenoid natural products identified to date largely originates from catalysis by two types of terpene synthases, prenyltransferases and cyclases. Prenyltransferases utilize 5-carbon building blocks in processive chain elongation reactions to generate linear C5n isoprenoid diphosphates (n = 2), which in turn serve as substrates for terpene cyclases that convert these linear precursors into structurally complex hydrocarbon products containing multiple rings and stereocenters. Terpene cyclization reactions are the most complex organic transformations found in nature in that more than half of the substrate carbon atoms undergo changes in chemical bonding during a multistep reaction sequence proceeding through several carbocation intermediates. Two general classes of cyclases are established on the basis of the chemistry of initial carbocation formation, and structural studies from our laboratory and others show that three fundamental protein folds designated a, ß, and ? govern this chemistry. Catalysis by a class I cyclase occurs in an a domain, where a trinuclear metal cluster activates the substrate diphosphate leaving group to generate an allylic cation. Catalysis by a class II cyclase occurs in a ß domain or at the interface of ß and ? domains, where an aspartic acid protonates the terminal p bond of the substrate to yield a tertiary carbocation.

Eros and Florence and of the monoterpene (-)-a-pinene in Fragaria vesca was investigated by in vivo feeding experiments with [5,5-2H2]mevalonic acid lactone (d2-MVL) and [5,5-2H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose (d2-DOX). The feeding experiments indicate that (S)-linalool and trans-(S)-nerolidol in Fragaria × ananassa Duch. and (-)-a-pinene in F. vesca are exclusively synthesized via the cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway without any contribution from the plastidial 1-deoxy-d-xylulose/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (DOXP/MEP) route. Inhibition experiments revealed that even the presence of mevastatin, an export of plastid-derived isopentyl diphosphate/dimethylallyl diphosphate, cannot be induced. However, the enantioselective analysis shows that in Fragaria × ananassa Duch. cv.

Contrarily, in Fragaria × ananassa Duch. foliage (R)-linalool is the dominant enantiomer. Feeding experiments revealed an incorporation of d2-MVL and d2-DOX at equal rates exclusively into (S)-linalool. Only in F. vesca foliage, where (R)-linalool is present at high enantiomeric purity (ee > 90%), is a de novo biosynthesis of the (R)-enantiomer via the DOXP/MEP pathway detectable.

The use of (2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate as an alternate substrate for recombinant TEAS resulted in a robust enzymatic cyclization to an array of products derived exclusively (=99.5%) from the cisoid pathway, whereas these same products account for ca. 2.5% of the total hydrocarbons obtained using (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate. Chromatographic fractionations of extracts from preparative incubations with the 2Z,6E substrate afforded, in addition to the acyclic allylic alcohols (2Z,6E)-farnesol (6.7%) and nerolidol (3.6%), five cyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and two cyclic sesquiterpene alcohols: (+)-2-epi-prezizaene (44%), (-)-a-cedrene (21.5%), (R)-(-)-ß-curcumene (15.5%), a-acoradiene (3.9%), 4-epi-a-acoradiene (1.3%), and equal amounts of a-bisabolol (1.8%) and epi-a-bisalolol (1.8%). The structures, stereochemistry, and enantiopurities were established by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, optical rotations, chemical correlations with known sesquiterpenes, comparisons with literature data, and GC analyses. The major product, (+)-2-epi-prezizaene, is structurally related to the naturally occurring tricyclic alcohol, jinkohol (2-epi-prezizaan-7ß-ol).

359,Cannabis Inflorescence for Medical Purposes: USP Considerations for Quality Attributes,"There is an active and growing interest in cannabis female inflorescence (Cannabis sativa) for medical purposes. Therefore, a definition of its quality attributes can help mitigate public health risks associated with contaminated, substandard, or adulterated products and support sound and reproducible basic and clinical research. As cannabis is a heterogeneous matrix that can contain a complex secondary metabolome with an uneven distribution of constituents, ensuring its quality requires appropriate sampling procedures and a suite of tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria to define the identity, content of constituents (e.g., cannabinoids), and limits on contaminants. As an independent science-based public health organization, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has formed a Cannabis Expert Panel, which has evaluated specifications necessary to define key cannabis quality attributes. The consensus within the expert panel was that these specifications should differentiate between cannabis chemotypes. Based on the secondary metabolite profiles, the expert panel has suggested adoption of three broad categories of cannabis. These three main chemotypes have been identified as useful for labeling based on the following cannabinoid constituents: (1) tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-dominant chemotype; (2) intermediate chemotype with both THC and cannabidiol (CBD); and (3) CBD-dominant chemotype. Cannabis plants in each of these chemotypes may be further subcategorized based on the content of other cannabinoids and/or mono- and sesquiterpene profiles. Morphological and chromatographic tests are presented for the identification and quantitative determination of critical constituents. Limits for contaminants including pesticide residues, microbial levels, mycotoxins, and elemental contaminants are presented based on toxicological considerations and aligned with the existing USP procedures for general tests and assays. The principles outlined in this review should be able to be used as the basis of public quality specifications for cannabis inflorescence, which are needed for public health protection and to facilitate scientific research on cannabis safety and therapeutic potential.",there active growing interest cannabis female inflorescence cannabis sativa medical purpose therefore definition quality attribute help mitigate public health risk associated contaminated substandard adulterated product support sound reproducible basic clinical research as cannabis heterogeneous matrix contain complex secondary metabolome uneven distribution constituent ensuring quality requires appropriate sampling procedure suite test analytical procedure acceptance criterion define identity content constituent e g cannabinoids limit contaminant as independent science based public health organization united states pharmacopeia usp formed cannabis expert panel evaluated specification necessary define key cannabis quality attribute the consensus within expert panel specification differentiate cannabis chemotypes based secondary metabolite profile expert panel suggested adoption three broad category cannabis these three main chemotypes identified useful labeling based following cannabinoid constituent tetrahydrocannabinol thc dominant chemotype intermediate chemotype thc cannabidiol cbd cbd dominant chemotype cannabis plant chemotypes may subcategorized based content cannabinoids mono sesquiterpene profile morphological chromatographic test presented identification quantitative determination critical constituent limits contaminant including pesticide residue microbial level mycotoxin elemental contaminant presented based toxicological consideration aligned existing usp procedure general test assay the principle outlined review able used basis public quality specification cannabis inflorescence needed public health protection facilitate scientific research cannabis safety therapeutic potential,low
360,Direct Conversion of CO2 to a-Farnesene Using Metabolically Engineered Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942,"Direct conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value-added chemicals by engineering of cyanobacteria has received attention as a sustainable strategy in food and chemical industries. Herein, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, a model cyanobacterium, was engineered to produce a-farnesene from CO2. As a result of the lack of farnesene synthase (FS) activity in the wild-type cyanobacterium, we metabolically engineered S. elongatus PCC 7942 to express heterologous FS from either Norway spruce or apple fruit, resulting in detectable peaks of a-farnesene. To enhance a-farnesene production, an optimized methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway was introduced in the farnesene-producing strain to supply farnesyl diphosphate. Subsequent cyanobacterial culture with a dodecane overlay resulted in photosynthetic production of a-farnesene (4.6 ± 0.4 mg/L in 7 days) from CO2.

363,Experiment and Simulation Reveal How Mutations in Functional Plasticity Regions Guide Plant Monoterpene Synthase Product Outcome,"Monoterpenes (C10 isoprenoids) are a structurally diverse group of natural compounds that are attractive to industry as flavors and fragrances. Monoterpenes are produced from a single linear substrate, geranyl diphosphate, by a group of enzymes called the monoterpene cyclases/synthases (mTC/Ss) that catalyze high-energy cyclization reactions involving unstable carbocation intermediates. Efforts toward producing monoterpenes via biocatalysis or metabolic engineering often result in the formation of multiple products due to the nature of the highly branched reaction mechanism of mTC/Ss. Rational engineering of mTC/Ss is hampered by the lack of correlation between the active site sequence and cyclization type. We used available mutagenesis data to show that amino acids involved in product outcome are clustered and spatially conserved within the mTC/S family. Consensus sequences for three such plasticity regions were introduced in different mTC/S with increasingly complex cyclization cascades, including the model enzyme limonene synthase (LimS). In all three mTC/Ss studied, mutations in the first two regions mostly give rise to products that result from premature quenching of the linalyl or a-terpinyl cations, suggesting that both plasticity regions are involved in the formation and stabilization of cations early in the reaction cascade. A LimS variant with mutations in the second region (S454G, C457V, M458I), produced mainly more complex bicyclic products. QM/MM MD simulations reveal that the second cyclization is not due to compression of the C2–C7 distance in the a-terpinyl cation but is the result of an increased distance between C8 of the a-terpinyl cation and two putative bases (W324, H579) located on the other side of the active site, preventing early termination by deprotonation. Such insights into the effect of mutations can only be obtained using integrated experimental and computational approaches and will aid the design of altered mTC/S activities toward clean monoterpenoid products.",monoterpenes c isoprenoids structurally diverse group natural compound attractive industry flavor fragrance monoterpenes produced single linear substrate geranyl diphosphate group enzyme called monoterpene cyclases synthases mtc ss catalyze high energy cyclization reaction involving unstable carbocation intermediate efforts toward producing monoterpenes via biocatalysis metabolic engineering often result formation multiple product due nature highly branched reaction mechanism mtc ss rational engineering mtc ss hampered lack correlation active site sequence cyclization type we used available mutagenesis data show amino acid involved product outcome clustered spatially conserved within mtc s family consensus sequence three plasticity region introduced different mtc s increasingly complex cyclization cascade including model enzyme limonene synthase lims in three mtc ss studied mutation first two region mostly give rise product result premature quenching linalyl terpinyl cation suggesting plasticity region involved formation stabilization cation early reaction cascade a lims variant mutation second region s g c v m i produced mainly complex bicyclic product qm mm md simulation reveal second cyclization due compression c c distance terpinyl cation result increased distance c terpinyl cation two putative base w h located side active site preventing early termination deprotonation such insight effect mutation obtained using integrated experimental computational approach aid design altered mtc s activity toward clean monoterpenoid product,low

369,Qualitative and Quantitative Characterization of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Cut Grass,"Mechanical wounding of plants triggers the release of a blend of reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). During and after mowing and harvesting of managed grasslands, significant BVOC emissions have the potential to alter the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere and lead to ozone and aerosol formation with consequences for regional air quality. We show that the amount and composition of BVOCs emitted per unit dry weight of plant material is comparable between laboratory enclosure measurements of artificially severed grassland plant species and in situ ecosystem-scale flux measurements above a temperate mountain grassland during and after periodic mowing and harvesting. The investigated grassland ecosystem emitted annually up to 130 mg carbon m–2 in response to cutting and drying, the largest part being consistently represented by methanol and a blend of green leaf volatiles (GLV). In addition, we report the plant species-specific emission of furfural, terpenoid-like compounds (e.g., camphor), and sesquiterpenes from cut plant material, which may be used as tracers for the presence of given plant species in the ecosystem.",mechanical wounding plant trigger release blend reactive biogenic volatile organic compound bvocs during mowing harvesting managed grassland significant bvoc emission potential alter physical chemical property atmosphere lead ozone aerosol formation consequence regional air quality we show amount composition bvocs emitted per unit dry weight plant material comparable laboratory enclosure measurement artificially severed grassland plant specie situ ecosystem scale flux measurement temperate mountain grassland periodic mowing harvesting the investigated grassland ecosystem emitted annually mg carbon response cutting drying largest part consistently represented methanol blend green leaf volatile glv in addition report plant specie specific emission furfural terpenoid like compound e g camphor sesquiterpenes cut plant material may used tracer presence given plant specie ecosystem,low
370,Rapid Discrimination and Feature Extraction of Three Chamaecyparis Species by Static-HS/GC–MS,"This study aimed to develop a rapid and accurate analytical method for discriminating three Chamaecyparis species (C. formosensis, C. obtusa, and C. obtusa var. formosana) that could not be easily distinguished by volatile compounds. A total of 23 leaf samples from three species were analyzed by static-headspace (static-HS) coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The static-HS procedure, whose experimental parameters were properly optimized, yielded a high Pearson correlation-based similarity between essential oil and VOC composition (r = 0.555–0.999). Thirty-six major constituents were identified; along with the results of cluster analysis (CA), a large variation in contents among the three different species was observed. Principal component analysis (PCA) methods illustrated graphically the relationships between characteristic components and tree species. It was clearly demonstrated that the static-HS-based procedure enhanced greatly the speed of precise analysis of chemical fingerprint in small sample amounts, thus providing a fast and reliable tool for the prediction of constituent characteristics in essential oil, and also offering good opportunities for studying the role of these feature compounds in chemotaxonomy or ecophysiology.",this study aimed develop rapid accurate analytical method discriminating three chamaecyparis specie c formosensis c obtusa c obtusa var formosana could easily distinguished volatile compound a total leaf sample three specie analyzed static headspace static hs coupled gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the static hs procedure whose experimental parameter properly optimized yielded high pearson correlation based similarity essential oil voc composition r thirty six major constituent identified along result cluster analysis ca large variation content among three different specie observed principal component analysis pca method illustrated graphically relationship characteristic component tree specie it clearly demonstrated static hs based procedure enhanced greatly speed precise analysis chemical fingerprint small sample amount thus providing fast reliable tool prediction constituent characteristic essential oil also offering good opportunity studying role feature compound chemotaxonomy ecophysiology,low
371,Recent Advances in the Biosynthesis of Farnesene Using Metabolic Engineering,"Farnesene, as an important sesquiterpene isoprenoid polymer of acetyl-CoA, is a renewable feedstock for diesel fuel, polymers, and cosmetics. It has been widely applied in agriculture, medicine, energy, and other fields. In recent years, farnesene biosynthesis is considered a green and economical approach because of its mild reaction conditions, low environmental pollution, and sustainability. Metabolic engineering has been widely applied to construct cell factories for farnesene biosynthesis. In this paper, the research progress, common problems, and strategies of farnesene biosynthesis are reviewed. They are mainly described from the perspectives of the current status of farnesene biosynthesis in different host cells, optimization of the metabolic pathway for farnesene biosynthesis, and key enzymes for farnesene biosynthesis.

372,Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation and Organic Nitrate Yield from NO3 Oxidation of Biogenic Hydrocarbons,"The secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass yields from NO3 oxidation of a series of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), consisting of five monoterpenes and one sesquiterpene (a-pinene, ß-pinene, ?-3-carene, limonene, sabinene, and ß-caryophyllene), were investigated in a series of continuous flow experiments in a 10 m3 indoor Teflon chamber. By making in situ measurements of the nitrate radical and employing a kinetics box model, we generate time-dependent yield curves as a function of reacted BVOC. SOA yields varied dramatically among the different BVOCs, from zero for a-pinene to 38–65% for ?-3-carene and 86% for ß-caryophyllene at mass loading of 10 µg m–3, suggesting that model mechanisms that treat all NO3 + monoterpene reactions equally will lead to errors in predicted SOA depending on each location’s mix of BVOC emissions. In most cases, organonitrate is a dominant component of the aerosol produced, but in the case of a-pinene, little organonitrate and no aerosol is formed.",the secondary organic aerosol soa mass yield no oxidation series biogenic volatile organic compound bvocs consisting five monoterpenes one sesquiterpene pinene pinene carene limonene sabinene caryophyllene investigated series continuous flow experiment indoor teflon chamber by making situ measurement nitrate radical employing kinetics box model generate time dependent yield curve function reacted bvoc soa yield varied dramatically among different bvocs zero pinene carene caryophyllene mass loading g suggesting model mechanism treat no monoterpene reaction equally lead error predicted soa depending location mix bvoc emission in case organonitrate dominant component aerosol produced case pinene little organonitrate aerosol formed,low
373,Sodorifen Biosynthesis in the Rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica Involves Methylation and Cyclization of MEP-Derived Farnesyl Pyrophosphate by a SAM-Dependent C-Methyltransferase,"The rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13 releases a unique polymethylated hydrocarbon (C16H26) with a bicyclo[3.2.1]octadiene skeleton called sodorifen. Sodorifen production depends on a gene cluster carrying a C-methyltransferase and a terpene cyclase along with two enzymes of the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Comparative analysis of wild-type and mutant volatile organic compound profiles revealed a C-methyltransferase-dependent C16 alcohol called pre-sodorifen, the production of which is upregulated in the terpene cyclase mutant. The monocyclic structure of this putative intermediate in sodorifen biosynthesis was identified by NMR spectroscopy. In vitro assays with the heterologously expressed S. plymuthica C-methyltransferase and terpene cyclase demonstrated that these enzymes act sequentially to convert farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) into sodorifen via a pre-sodorifen pyrophosphate intermediate, indicating that the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent C-methyltransferase from S. plymuthica exhibits unprecedented cyclase activity. In vivo incorporation experiments with 13C-labeled succinate, l-alanine, and l-methionine confirmed a MEP pathway to FPP via the canonical glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate, as well as its SAM-dependent methylation in pre-sodorifen and sodorifen biosynthesis. 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy facilitated the localization of 13C labels and provided detailed insights into the biosynthetic pathway from FPP via pre-sodorifen pyrophosphate to sodorifen.",the rhizobacterium serratia plymuthica rx release unique polymethylated hydrocarbon c h bicyclo octadiene skeleton called sodorifen sodorifen production depends gene cluster carrying c methyltransferase terpene cyclase along two enzyme c methyl erythritol phosphate mep pathway isoprenoid biosynthesis comparative analysis wild type mutant volatile organic compound profile revealed c methyltransferase dependent c alcohol called pre sodorifen production upregulated terpene cyclase mutant the monocyclic structure putative intermediate sodorifen biosynthesis identified nmr spectroscopy in vitro assay heterologously expressed s plymuthica c methyltransferase terpene cyclase demonstrated enzyme act sequentially convert farnesyl pyrophosphate fpp sodorifen via pre sodorifen pyrophosphate intermediate indicating s adenosyl methionine sam dependent c methyltransferase s plymuthica exhibit unprecedented cyclase activity in vivo incorporation experiment c labeled succinate l alanine l methionine confirmed mep pathway fpp via canonical glyceraldehyde phosphate pyruvate well sam dependent methylation pre sodorifen sodorifen biosynthesis c h nmr spectroscopy facilitated localization c label provided detailed insight biosynthetic pathway fpp via pre sodorifen pyrophosphate sodorifen,low
374,Comprehending and improving cannabis specialized metabolism in the systems biology era,"Abstract

Cannabis sativa is a source of food, fiber and specialized metabolites such as cannabinoids, with psychoactive and pharmacological effects. Due to its expanding and increasingly-accepted use in medicine, cannabis cultivation is acquiring more importance and less social stigma. Humans initiated different domestication episodes whose later spread gave rise to a plethora of landrace cultivars. At present, breeders cross germplasms from different gene pools depending on their specific use. The fiber (hemp) and drug (marijuana) types of C. sativa differ in their cannabinoid chemical composition phenotype (chemotype) and also in the accumulation of terpenoid compounds that constitute a strain’s particular flavor and scent. Cannabinoids are isoprenylated polyketides among which cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and (-)-trans-??-tetrahydrocannabinol acid (THCA) have been well-documented for their many effects on humans. Here, we review the most studied specialized metabolic pathways in C. sativa, showing how terpenes and cannabinoids share both part of the isoprenoid pathway and the same biosynthetic compartmentalization (i.e. glandular trichomes of leaves and flowers). We enlist the several studies that have deciphered these pathways in this species including physical and genetic maps, QTL analyses and localization and enzymatic studies of cannabinoid and terpene synthases. In addition, new comparative modeling of cannabinoid synthases and phylogenetic trees are presented. We describe the genome sequencing initiatives of several accessions with the concomitant generation of next-generation genome maps and transcriptomic data. Very recently, proteomic characterizations and systems biology approaches such as those applying network theory or the integration of multi-omics data have increased the knowledge on gene function, enzyme diversity and metabolite content in C. sativa. In this revision we drift through the history, present and future of cannabis research and on how second- and third-generation sequencing technologies are bringing light to the field of cannabis specialized metabolism. We also discuss different biotechnological approaches for producing cannabinoids in engineered microorganisms.",abstract cannabis sativa source food fiber specialized metabolite cannabinoids psychoactive pharmacological effect due expanding increasingly accepted use medicine cannabis cultivation acquiring importance le social stigma humans initiated different domestication episode whose later spread gave rise plethora landrace cultivar at present breeder cross germplasms different gene pool depending specific use the fiber hemp drug marijuana type c sativa differ cannabinoid chemical composition phenotype chemotype also accumulation terpenoid compound constitute strain particular flavor scent cannabinoids isoprenylated polyketides among cannabidiolic acid cbda trans tetrahydrocannabinol acid thca well documented many effect human here review studied specialized metabolic pathway c sativa showing terpene cannabinoids share part isoprenoid pathway biosynthetic compartmentalization e glandular trichomes leaf flower we enlist several study deciphered pathway specie including physical genetic map qtl analysis localization enzymatic study cannabinoid terpene synthases in addition new comparative modeling cannabinoid synthases phylogenetic tree presented we describe genome sequencing initiative several accession concomitant generation next generation genome map transcriptomic data very recently proteomic characterization system biology approach applying network theory integration multi omics data increased knowledge gene function enzyme diversity metabolite content c sativa in revision drift history present future cannabis research second third generation sequencing technology bringing light field cannabis specialized metabolism we also discus different biotechnological approach producing cannabinoids engineered microorganism,low
375,"Cytochrome P450s from Cynara cardunculus L. CYP71AV9 and CYP71BL5, catalyze distinct hydroxylations in the sesquiterpene lactone biosynthetic pathway","Abstract

Cynara cardunculus (Asteraceae) is a cross pollinated perennial crop which includes the two cultivated taxa globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon. The leaves of these plants contain high concentrations of sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) among which cynaropicrin is the most represented, and has recently attracted attention because of its therapeutic potential as anti-tumor and anti-photoaging agent. Costunolide is considered the common precursor of the STLs and three enzymes are involved in its biosynthetic pathway: i.e. the germacrene A synthase (GAS), the germacrene A oxidase (GAO) and the costunolide synthase (COS). Here we report on the isolation of two P450 genes, (i.e. CYP71AV9 and CYP71BL5), in a set of ~19,000 C. cardunculus unigenes, and their functional characterization in yeast and in planta. The metabolite analyses revealed that the co-expression of CYP71AV9 together with GAS resulted in the biosynthesis of germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid in yeast. The co-expression of CYP71BL5 and CYP71AV9 with GAS led to biosynthesis of the free costunolide in yeast and costunolide conjugates in Nicotiana benthamiana, demonstrating their involvement in STL biosynthesis as GAO and COS enzymes. The substrate specificity of CYP71AV9 was investigated by testing its ability to convert amorpha-4,11-diene, (+)-germacrene D and cascarilladiene to their oxidized products when co-expressed in yeast with the corresponding terpene synthases.",abstract cynara cardunculus asteraceae cross pollinated perennial crop includes two cultivated taxon globe artichoke cultivated cardoon the leaf plant contain high concentration sesquiterpene lactones stls among cynaropicrin represented recently attracted attention therapeutic potential anti tumor anti photoaging agent costunolide considered common precursor stls three enzyme involved biosynthetic pathway e germacrene a synthase gas germacrene a oxidase gao costunolide synthase cos here report isolation two p gene e cyp av cyp bl set c cardunculus unigenes functional characterization yeast planta the metabolite analysis revealed co expression cyp av together gas resulted biosynthesis germacra trien oic acid yeast the co expression cyp bl cyp av gas led biosynthesis free costunolide yeast costunolide conjugate nicotiana benthamiana demonstrating involvement stl biosynthesis gao cos enzyme the substrate specificity cyp av investigated testing ability convert amorpha diene germacrene d cascarilladiene oxidized product co expressed yeast corresponding terpene synthases,low
376,De novo synthesis of the sedative valerenic acid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Abstract

Valeriana officinalis (Valerian) root extracts have been used by European and Asian cultures for millennia for their anxiolytic and sedative properties. However, the efficacy of these extracts suffers from variable yields and composition, making these extracts a prime candidate for microbial production. Recently, valerenic acid, a C15 sesquiterpenoid, was identified as the active compound that modulates the GABAA channel. Although the first committed step, valerena-4,7(11)-diene synthase, has been identified and described, the complete valerenic acid biosynthetic pathway remains to be elucidated. Sequence homology and tissue-specific expression profiles of V. officinalis putative P450s led to the discovery of a V. officinalis valerena-4,7(11)-diene oxidase, VoCYP71DJ1, which required coexpression with a V. officinalis alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase to complete valerenic acid biosynthesis in yeast. Further, we demonstrated the stable integration of all pathway enzymes in yeast, resulting in the production of 140?mg/L of valerena-4,7(11)-diene and 4?mg/L of valerenic acid in milliliter plates. These findings showcase Saccharomyces cerevisiae's potential as an expression platform for facilitating multiply-oxidized medicinal terpenoid pathway discovery, possibly paving the way for scale up and FDA approval of valerenic acid and other active compounds from plant-derived herbal medicines.",abstract valeriana officinalis valerian root extract used european asian culture millennium anxiolytic sedative property however efficacy extract suffers variable yield composition making extract prime candidate microbial production recently valerenic acid c sesquiterpenoid identified active compound modulates gabaa channel although first committed step valerena diene synthase identified described complete valerenic acid biosynthetic pathway remains elucidated sequence homology tissue specific expression profile v officinalis putative p led discovery v officinalis valerena diene oxidase vocyp dj required coexpression v officinalis alcohol dehydrogenase aldehyde dehydrogenase complete valerenic acid biosynthesis yeast further demonstrated stable integration pathway enzyme yeast resulting production mg l valerena diene mg l valerenic acid milliliter plate these finding showcase saccharomyces cerevisiae potential expression platform facilitating multiply oxidized medicinal terpenoid pathway discovery possibly paving way scale fda approval valerenic acid active compound plant derived herbal medicine,low

Petroleum-derived liquid fuels and commodities play a part in nearly every aspect of modern daily life. However, dependence on this one natural resource to maintain modern amenities has caused negative environmental and geopolitical ramifications. In an effort to replace petroleum, technologies to synthesize liquid fuels and other commodities from renewable biomass are being developed. Current technologies, however, only use a portion of plant biomass feedstocks for fuel and useful products. ""Using the whole feedstock buffalo"" or optimally using all portions and biochemicals present in renewable biomass will enhance the economic and environmental feasibility of biofuels and coproducts. To accomplish this optimization, greater understanding of the relationship between liquid fuel and bioproduct properties and plant chemistries is needed. Liquid fuel properties and how they relate to biochemistry and petrochemistry are discussed. Enhanced biofuel yields and high-value commodities from biomass are needed to sustainably replace petroleum-based products. Several metabolic engineering strategies are discussed. We will describe paths of possible fuel and product diversification using dedicated lignocellulosic biomass (e.g., switchgrass).",abstract petroleum derived liquid fuel commodity play part nearly every aspect modern daily life however dependence one natural resource maintain modern amenity caused negative environmental geopolitical ramification in effort replace petroleum technology synthesize liquid fuel commodity renewable biomass developed current technology however use portion plant biomass feedstock fuel useful product using whole feedstock buffalo optimally using portion biochemicals present renewable biomass enhance economic environmental feasibility biofuels coproducts to accomplish optimization greater understanding relationship liquid fuel bioproduct property plant chemistry needed liquid fuel property relate biochemistry petrochemistry discussed enhanced biofuel yield high value commodity biomass needed sustainably replace petroleum based product several metabolic engineering strategy discussed we describe path possible fuel product diversification using dedicated lignocellulosic biomass e g switchgrass,high

Two examples of natural terpenoid production are described (rubber and astaxanthin), but the advent of metabolic engineering has allowed the development of fermentative production processes using heterologous microorganisms. The two biochemical pathways responsible for terpenoid production are described, along with manipulations that enable production of terpenoids at economically viable levels.

379,Differences of aroma development and metabolic pathway gene expression between Kyoho and 87-1 grapes,"Abstract

Aroma is an important quality trait of grapes and often the focus of consumers, viticulturists and grapevine breeders. Kyoho is a hybrid between Vitis vinifera and Vitis labrusca with a strawberry-like scent, while 87-1 is an early-ripening mutant of Muscat hamburg, belonging to Vitis vinifera, with a rose scent. In this study, we compared their aroma compositions and concentrations during berry development by headspace-SPME combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and analyzed the expression differences of enzyme-encoding genes in the LOX-HPL, MEP and MVA metabolic pathways by qRT-PCR. Twelve esters were detected in Kyoho during the whole berry development and they were abundant after veraison, but no esters were detected in 87-1 berries. Linalool was the dominant terpene among the 14 terpenes detected in 87-1 berries, while limited amounts of terpenes were detected in Kyoho berries. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the low expression of VvAAT might explain the low content of ester volatiles in 87-1 berries, and the low expression of coding genes in the MEP pathway, especially VvPNLinNer1, might be the reason for the low content of volatile terpenes in Kyoho berries.

The rhizome of Atractylodes macrocephala is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine containing a variety of sesquiterpenoids and has a wide range of bioactivities. Due to the lack of genetic information, the rhizome growth and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in A. macrocephala are basically unknown. In this study, the metabolic analysis and transcriptome sequencing of five different tissues (rhizomes, roots, stems, leaves and buds) of A. macrocephala were performed. Over 97.08 Gb clean data obtained from fifteen sequencing samples were assembled into 144,137 unigenes. Transcription factor (TF) analysis revealed that 14 TFs predominantly expressed in the rhizomes might be involved in the regulation of rhizome growth and sesquiterpene biosynthesis. A total of 73 unigenes and 287 CYP450s were annotated to sesquiterpene biosynthesis, and AmFPPS was verified to catalyze the biosynthesis of sesquiterpene.

381,Direct evidence of specific localization of sesquiterpenes and marchantin A in oil body cells of Marchantia polymorpha L.,"Abstract

Liverworts are a rich source of a diverse array of specialized metabolites, such as terpenoids and benzenoids, which are potentially useful for pharmaceutical or agrochemical applications, and also provide clues to elucidate the strategy by which liverworts adapt to the terrestrial environment. Liverworts, belonging to orders Marchantiales and Jungermanniales, possess oil bodies. In Marchantia polymorpha L., oil bodies are confined to scattered idioblastic oil body cells. It has been assumed that the specialized metabolites in M. polymorpha specifically accumulate in the oil bodies in oil body cells; however, no direct evidence was previously available for this specific accumulation. In this study, direct evidence was obtained using micromanipulation techniques coupled with MS analysis that demonstrated the specific accumulation of sesquiterpenoids and marchantin A in the oil body cells of M. polymorpha thalli. It was also observed that the number of oil body cells increased in thalli grown in low-mineral conditions. The amounts of sesquiterpenoids and marchantin A detected in crude extract prepared from the whole thallus were roughly proportional to the number of oil body cells found in a given volume of thallus, suggesting that oil body cell differentiation and sesquiterpenoid and marchantin A biosynthetic pathways are coordinated with each other.",abstract liverworts rich source diverse array specialized metabolite terpenoids benzenoids potentially useful pharmaceutical agrochemical application also provide clue elucidate strategy liverwort adapt terrestrial environment liverworts belonging order marchantiales jungermanniales posse oil body in marchantia polymorpha l oil body confined scattered idioblastic oil body cell it assumed specialized metabolite m polymorpha specifically accumulate oil body oil body cell however direct evidence previously available specific accumulation in study direct evidence obtained using micromanipulation technique coupled ms analysis demonstrated specific accumulation sesquiterpenoids marchantin a oil body cell m polymorpha thallus it also observed number oil body cell increased thallus grown low mineral condition the amount sesquiterpenoids marchantin a detected crude extract prepared whole thallus roughly proportional number oil body cell found given volume thallus suggesting oil body cell differentiation sesquiterpenoid marchantin a biosynthetic pathway coordinated,medium
382,Discovery and Characterization of Terpenoid Biosynthetic Pathways of Fungi,"Abstract

Fungi produce a myriad of terpenoids with a broad range of biological activities, many of which can be adapted to human use. This requires knowledge of the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of these compounds. Herein, we describe strategies for identification and characterization of putative biosynthetic genes, structural examination of important pathway enzymes with a focus on altering activity, and identification of biosynthetic clusters, and genome mining for yet-to-be-discovered pathways. Fungi are a particularly attractive class of organism for terpenoid pathway discovery, as they often cluster their biosynthetic genes. The affordability of genome sequencing and the relatively small size of fungal genomes further simplify this process. While only a select few fungal strains are genetically tractable, many terpenoid biosynthetic genes are functional in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, allowing easy characterization. Identification of new terpenoid biosynthetic pathways has the potential to uncover new pharmaceutical compounds and establish new strategies for metabolic engineering.",abstract fungi produce myriad terpenoids broad range biological activity many adapted human use this requires knowledge enzyme responsible biosynthesis compound herein describe strategy identification characterization putative biosynthetic gene structural examination important pathway enzyme focus altering activity identification biosynthetic cluster genome mining yet discovered pathway fungi particularly attractive class organism terpenoid pathway discovery often cluster biosynthetic gene the affordability genome sequencing relatively small size fungal genome simplify process while select fungal strain genetically tractable many terpenoid biosynthetic gene functional escherichia coli saccharomyces cerevisiae allowing easy characterization identification new terpenoid biosynthetic pathway potential uncover new pharmaceutical compound establish new strategy metabolic engineering,low
383,Discovery of germacrene A synthases in Barnadesia spinosa: The first committed step in sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis in the basal member of the Asteraceae,"Abstract

The Andes-endemic Barnadesioideae lineage is the oldest surviving and phylogenetically basal subfamily of the Asteraceae (Compositae), a prolific group of flowering plants with world-wide distribution (~24,000 species) marked by a rich diversity of sesquiterpene lactones (STLs). Intriguingly, there is no evidence that members of the Barnadesioideae produce STLs, specialized metabolites thought to have contributed to the adaptive success of the Asteraceae family outside South America. The biosynthesis of STLs requires the intimate expression and functional integration of germacrene A synthase (GAS) and germacrene A oxidase (GAO) to sequentially cyclize and oxidize farnesyl diphosphate into the advanced intermediate germacrene A acid leading to diverse STLs. Our previous discovery of GAO activity conserved across all major subfamilies of Asteraceae, including the phylogenetically basal lineage of Barnadesioideae, prompted further investigation of the presence of the gateway GAS in Barnadesioideae. Herein we isolated two terpene synthases (BsGAS1/BsGAS2) from the basal Barnadesia spinosa (Barnadesioideae) that displayed robust GAS activity when reconstituted in yeast and characterized in vitro. Despite the apparent lack of STLs in the Barnadesioideae, this work unambiguously confirms the presence of GAS in the basal genera of the Asteraceae. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the two BsGASs fall into two distinct clades of the Asteraceae's GASs, and BsGAS1 clade is only retained in the evolutionary closer Cichorioideae subfamily, implicating BsGAS2 is likely the ancestral base of most GASs found in the lineages outside the Barnadesioideae.

384,Disproportionate photosynthetic decline and inverse relationship between constitutive and induced volatile emissions upon feeding of Quercus robur leaves by large larvae of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar),"Abstract

Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L., Lymantriinae) is a major pest of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) forests in Europe, but how its infections scale with foliage physiological characteristics, in particular with photosynthesis rates and emissions of volatile organic compounds has not been studied. Differently from the majority of insect herbivores, large larvae of L. dispar rapidly consume leaf area, and can also bite through tough tissues, including secondary and primary leaf veins. Given the rapid and devastating feeding responses, we hypothesized that infection of Q. robur leaves by L. dispar leads to disproportionate scaling of leaf photosynthesis and constitutive isoprene emissions with damaged leaf area, and to less prominent enhancements of induced volatile release. Leaves with 0% (control) to 50% of leaf area removed by larvae were studied. Across this range of infection severity, all physiological characteristics were quantitatively correlated with the degree of damage, but all these traits changed disproportionately with the degree of damage. The net assimilation rate was reduced by almost 10-fold and constitutive isoprene emissions by more than 7-fold, whereas the emissions of green leaf volatiles, monoterpenes, methyl salicylate and the homoterpene (3E)-4,8-dimethy-1,3,7-nonatriene scaled negatively and almost linearly with net assimilation rate through damage treatments. This study demonstrates that feeding by large insect herbivores disproportionately alters photosynthetic rate and constitutive isoprene emissions. Furthermore, the leaves have a surprisingly large capacity for enhancement of induced emissions even when foliage photosynthetic function is severely impaired.",abstract gypsy moth lymantria dispar l lymantriinae major pest pedunculate oak quercus robur forest europe infection scale foliage physiological characteristic particular photosynthesis rate emission volatile organic compound studied differently majority insect herbivore large larva l dispar rapidly consume leaf area also bite tough tissue including secondary primary leaf vein given rapid devastating feeding response hypothesized infection q robur leaf l dispar lead disproportionate scaling leaf photosynthesis constitutive isoprene emission damaged leaf area le prominent enhancement induced volatile release leaves control leaf area removed larva studied across range infection severity physiological characteristic quantitatively correlated degree damage trait changed disproportionately degree damage the net assimilation rate reduced almost fold constitutive isoprene emission fold whereas emission green leaf volatile monoterpenes methyl salicylate homoterpene e dimethy nonatriene scaled negatively almost linearly net assimilation rate damage treatment this study demonstrates feeding large insect herbivore disproportionately alters photosynthetic rate constitutive isoprene emission furthermore leaf surprisingly large capacity enhancement induced emission even foliage photosynthetic function severely impaired,low
385,Do future climate conditions change volatile organic compound emissions from Artemisia annua? Elevated CO2 and temperature modulate actual VOC emission rate but not its emission capacity,"Abstract

Increasing temperature and atmospheric [CO2] can change plant VOC emissions, thereby providing a possible feedback to climate change by altering particle and greenhouse gas formation. While evidence gathered on isoprene emission generally indicated an inhibitory effect of elevated CO2 on emission at moderate temperature, it is unclear whether the emissions of other volatiles respond in a similar way. In a greenhouse study, we grew Artemisia annua plants under two [CO2] regimes (400/800 ppm) combined with two temperature regimes (25/15 and 30/20 °C) and determined emissions at two assay [CO2] (400/800 ppm) combined with two assay temperatures (30/37 °C). Foliar VOC concentrations were unaffected by growth conditions and resembled emissions consisting mainly of monoterpenes (>92%) and sesquiterpenes (>7%).

However, this apparent negative effect of growth [CO2] was compensated by increased plant growth. Irrespective of growth conditions, doubling assay [CO2] significantly reduced emissions at 37 °C by about 30% and had no effect at 30 °C. Emissions always increased on the increase in assay temperature, with monoterpenes responding more strongly than sesquiterpenes (mean %-increase of 17.5 and 12.5 °C-1).

386,Drought stress adaptation modulates plant secondary metabolite production in Salvia dolomitica Codd,"Abstract

Sage is an important medicinal and aromatic plant. While Salvia officinalis and S. miltiorrhiza have been widely studied, little information regarding S. dolomitica exists, although it has recently attracted attention due to its anti-plasmodial and anti-inflammatory properties. This study investigated the performance and metabolic profile of this species in response to two drought treatments (moderate or severe) relative to well-watered control plants. Changes in growth and ecophysiological traits, as well as in bioactive and volatile compounds and essential oil production were determined. Given that terpenoids are the most representative class of secondary metabolites, the gene expression of key enzymes of terpenoid biosynthesis was also investigated. Moderate drought stimulated a decline in leaf water potential, growth and stomatal conductance, as well as an increase in deyhdrin expression. Serious stress symptoms occurred only in severe drought-stressed plants, where a decline in net photosynthesis and transpiration and an increase in endogenous abscisic acid was observed. Both drought stress conditions led to modulate the expression of some genes involved in biogenic volatile organic compound and essential oil biosynthesis and metabolic profile. In particular, drought induced an increase in sesquiterpene production, a class of terpenoids that is important in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Thus, controlled drought, in addition to water savings during cultivation, can be applied to improve the production of secondary metabolites in S. dolomitica.",abstract sage important medicinal aromatic plant while salvia officinalis s miltiorrhiza widely studied little information regarding s dolomitica exists although recently attracted attention due anti plasmodial anti inflammatory property this study investigated performance metabolic profile specie response two drought treatment moderate severe relative well watered control plant changes growth ecophysiological trait well bioactive volatile compound essential oil production determined given terpenoids representative class secondary metabolite gene expression key enzyme terpenoid biosynthesis also investigated moderate drought stimulated decline leaf water potential growth stomatal conductance well increase deyhdrin expression serious stress symptom occurred severe drought stressed plant decline net photosynthesis transpiration increase endogenous abscisic acid observed both drought stress condition led modulate expression gene involved biogenic volatile organic compound essential oil biosynthesis metabolic profile in particular drought induced increase sesquiterpene production class terpenoids important food cosmetic pharmaceutical industry thus controlled drought addition water saving cultivation applied improve production secondary metabolite s dolomitica,high
387,Dynamic control of gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae engineered for the production of plant sesquitepene a-santalene in a fed-batch mode,"Abstract

Microbial cells engineered for efficient production of plant sesquiterpenes may allow for sustainable and scalable production of these compounds that can be used as e.g. perfumes and pharmaceuticals. Here, for the first time a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain capable of producing high levels of a-santalene, the precursor of a commercially interesting compound, was constructed through a rationally designed metabolic engineering approach. Optimal sesquiterpene production was obtained by modulating the expression of one of the key metabolic steps of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, squalene synthase (Erg9). To couple ERG9 expression to glucose concentration its promoter was replaced by the HXT1 promoter. In a second approach, the HXT2 promoter was used to express an ERG9 antisense construct. Using the HXT1 promoter to control ERG9 expression, it was possible to divert the carbon flux from sterol synthesis towards a-santalene improving the productivity by 3.4 fold. Combining this approach together with the overexpression of a truncated form of 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and deletion of lipid phosphate phosphatase encoded by LPP1 led to a strain with a productivity of 0.18 mg/gDCW h. The titer was further increased by deleting DPP1 encoding a second FPP consuming pyrophosphate phosphatase yielding a final productivity and titer, respectively, of 0.21 mg/gDCW h and 92 mg/l of a-santalene.",abstract microbial cell engineered efficient production plant sesquiterpenes may allow sustainable scalable production compound used e g perfume pharmaceutical here first time saccharomyces cerevisiae strain capable producing high level santalene precursor commercially interesting compound constructed rationally designed metabolic engineering approach optimal sesquiterpene production obtained modulating expression one key metabolic step mevalonate mva pathway squalene synthase erg to couple erg expression glucose concentration promoter replaced hxt promoter in second approach hxt promoter used express erg antisense construct using hxt promoter control erg expression possible divert carbon flux sterol synthesis towards santalene improving productivity fold combining approach together overexpression truncated form hydroxyl methyl glutaryl coa reductase hmgr deletion lipid phosphate phosphatase encoded lpp led strain productivity mg gdcw h the titer increased deleting dpp encoding second fpp consuming pyrophosphate phosphatase yielding final productivity titer respectively mg gdcw h mg l santalene,high
388,Dynamic pathway allocation in early terpenoid biosynthesis of stress-induced lima bean leaves,"Abstract

Two independent pathways contribute in higher plants to the formation of isopenteny1 diphosphate (IDP), the central building block of isoprenoids. In general, the cytosolic mevalonate pathway (MVA) provides the precursors for sesquiterpenes and sterols, whereas the plastidial methylerythritol pathway (MEP) furnishes the monoterpene-, diterpene- and carotenoids. Administration of deuterium labeled 1-deoxy-d-xylulose and mevalolactone to lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus), followed by gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric analysis of de novo produced volatiles revealed that the strict separation of both pathways does not exist. This could be confirmed by blocking the pathways individually with cerivastatin® (MVA) and fosmidomycin (MEP), respectively. Isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) at natural abundance levels demonstrated independently and without the need for labeled precursors a dynamic allocation of the MVA- or the MEP-pathway in the biosynthesis of the nerolidol-derived homoterpene 4,8-dimethy1-nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT).

389,Early transcriptional response of terpenoid metabolism to Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in a resistant wild strawberry Fragaria nilgerrensis,"Abstract

Modern strawberry production is often threatened by microbe pathogens. Anthracnose is among the most prominent fungal disease caused mainly by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and leads to large-scale losses both in quality and yield. Little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying the genetics in the strawberry-C. gloeosporioides interaction. In the current research, a wild accession ‘Fragaria nilgerrensis’ is used as a resistant model to study the roles of terpenoid and terpene genes in leaf response to C. gloeosporioides. We found that several terpenoids and terpene genes were up-regulated at early time points after challenged with C. gloeosporioides. Among the metabolites detected, sesquiterpenes were the most significantly accumulated compounds, increasing up to ~12-fold at 18 h post infection (hpi), followed by monoterpenes which showed a slight increase upon infection. Consistently, the time-resolved transcriptome data revealed that genes pertaining to terpenoid metabolism were rapidly up-regulated and co-expressed with signaling pathway genes relevant to defense response. Notably, quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that the expression of five terpene synthase genes (TPS) were greatly enhanced, by a factor of one to three orders of magnitude at 3–6 hpi. Our results reveal a possible link between rapidly induced terpenoid metabolism and the autoimmunity underlying anthracnose resistance in a wild strawberry species.",abstract modern strawberry production often threatened microbe pathogen anthracnose among prominent fungal disease caused mainly colletotrichum gloeosporioides lead large scale loss quality yield little known regarding mechanism underlying genetics strawberry c gloeosporioides interaction in current research wild accession fragaria nilgerrensis used resistant model study role terpenoid terpene gene leaf response c gloeosporioides we found several terpenoids terpene gene regulated early time point challenged c gloeosporioides among metabolite detected sesquiterpenes significantly accumulated compound increasing fold h post infection hpi followed monoterpenes showed slight increase upon infection consistently time resolved transcriptome data revealed gene pertaining terpenoid metabolism rapidly regulated co expressed signaling pathway gene relevant defense response notably quantitative real time pcr confirmed expression five terpene synthase gene tps greatly enhanced factor one three order magnitude hpi our result reveal possible link rapidly induced terpenoid metabolism autoimmunity underlying anthracnose resistance wild strawberry specie,low
390,Effects of elevated ozone on the emission of volatile isoprenoids from flowers and leaves of rose (Rosa sp.) varieties,"Abstract

Tropospheric ozone (O3) affects isoprenoid emissions, and floral emissions in particular, which may result in potential impacts on the interactions of plants with other organisms. The effects of ozone (O3) on isoprenoid emissions have been investigated for many years, while knowledge on O3 effects on floral emissions is still scarce and the relevant mechanism has not been clarified so far. We investigated the effects of O3 on floral and foliar isoprenoid emissions (mainly isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) and their synthase substrates from three rose varieties (CH, Rosa chinensis Jacq. var. chinensis; SA, R. hybrida ‘Saiun’; MO, R. hybrida ‘Monica Bellucci’) at different exposure durations. Results indicated that the O3-induced stimulation after short-term exposure (35 days after the beginning of O3 exposure) was significant only for sesquiterpene emissions from flowers, while long-term O3 exposure (90 days after the beginning of O3 exposure) significantly decreased both foliar and floral monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions. In addition, the observed decline of emissions under long-term O3 exposure resulted from the limitation of synthase substrates, and the responses of emissions and substrates varied among varieties, with the greatest variation in the O3-sensitive variety. These findings provide important insights on plant isoprenoid emissions and species selection for landscaping, especially in areas with high O3 concentration.",abstract tropospheric ozone o affect isoprenoid emission floral emission particular may result potential impact interaction plant organism the effect ozone o isoprenoid emission investigated many year knowledge o effect floral emission still scarce relevant mechanism clarified far we investigated effect o floral foliar isoprenoid emission mainly isoprene monoterpenes sesquiterpenes synthase substrate three rose variety ch rosa chinensis jacq var chinensis sa r hybrida saiun mo r hybrida monica bellucci different exposure duration results indicated o induced stimulation short term exposure day beginning o exposure significant sesquiterpene emission flower long term o exposure day beginning o exposure significantly decreased foliar floral monoterpene sesquiterpene emission in addition observed decline emission long term o exposure resulted limitation synthase substrate response emission substrate varied among variety greatest variation o sensitive variety these finding provide important insight plant isoprenoid emission specie selection landscaping especially area high o concentration,low
391,Effects of Mirazid® and myrrh volatile oil on adult Fasciola gigantica under laboratory conditions,"Abstract
Objective

To evaluate the effects of Mirazid® and myrrh volatile oil on adult Fasciola gigantica (F. gigantica) under laboratory conditions.

Methods

The effects of oleoresin extract of myrrh (Mirazid®) and myrrh volatile oil on the surface morphology of adult F. gigantica following treatment in vitro had been determined by scanning electron microscopy. The results were compared with those observed in the fluke tegument following incubation in triclabendazole sulphoxide (TCBZ-SO), active form, (Fasinex®, Ciba-Geigy).

Results

Observations of the efficacy of Mirazid® oleoresin extract and myrrh volatile oil indicated that both products showed dose-dependent anthelmintic efficacy. The anterior half of the fluke was consistently more severely affected than the posterior half. The surface changes induced by Mirazid® oleoresin extract were less severe than those observed after exposure to either myrrh volatile oil or TCBZ-SO. Flukes showed swelling after these treatments, but its level and blebbing were much greater with myrrh volatile oil; in which patches of tegumental sloughing were observed in the apical cone and the posterior mid-body region of flukes. This was not observed after treatment with Mirazid® oleoresin extract.

Conclusions

The comparatively more disruption, observed in myrrh volatile oil exposed specimens, compared to that exposed to Mirazid® oleoresin extract might suggest that the anthelmintic activity of Mirazid® oleo resin extract was attributed to its content of volatile oil. So, increasing the concentration of myrrh volatile oil in Mirazid® might possibly help to developing its anthelmintic activity.",abstract objective to evaluate effect mirazid myrrh volatile oil adult fasciola gigantica f gigantica laboratory condition methods the effect oleoresin extract myrrh mirazid myrrh volatile oil surface morphology adult f gigantica following treatment vitro determined scanning electron microscopy the result compared observed fluke tegument following incubation triclabendazole sulphoxide tcbz so active form fasinex ciba geigy results observations efficacy mirazid oleoresin extract myrrh volatile oil indicated product showed dose dependent anthelmintic efficacy the anterior half fluke consistently severely affected posterior half the surface change induced mirazid oleoresin extract le severe observed exposure either myrrh volatile oil tcbz so flukes showed swelling treatment level blebbing much greater myrrh volatile oil patch tegumental sloughing observed apical cone posterior mid body region fluke this observed treatment mirazid oleoresin extract conclusions the comparatively disruption observed myrrh volatile oil exposed specimen compared exposed mirazid oleoresin extract might suggest anthelmintic activity mirazid oleo resin extract attributed content volatile oil so increasing concentration myrrh volatile oil mirazid might possibly help developing anthelmintic activity,low
392,Efficient diterpene production in yeast by engineering Erg20p into a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase,"Abstract

Terpenes have numerous applications, ranging from pharmaceuticals to fragrances and biofuels. With increasing interest in producing terpenes sustainably and economically, there has been significant progress in recent years in developing methods for their production in microorganisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, production of the 20-carbon diterpenes has so far proven to be significantly less efficient than production of their 15-carbon sesquiterpene counterparts. In this report, we identify the modular structure of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthesis in yeast to be a major limitation in diterpene yields, and we engineer the yeast farnesyl diphosphate synthase Erg20p to produce geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Using a combination of protein and genetic engineering, we achieve significant improvements in the production of sclareol and several other isoprenoids, including cis-abienol, abietadiene and ß-carotene. We also report the development of yeast strains carrying the engineered Erg20p, which support efficient isoprenoid production and can be used as a dedicated chassis for diterpene production or biosynthetic pathway elucidation. The design developed here can be applied to the production of any GGPP-derived isoprenoid and is compatible with other yeast terpene production platforms.",abstract terpenes numerous application ranging pharmaceutical fragrance biofuels with increasing interest producing terpene sustainably economically significant progress recent year developing method production microorganism in saccharomyces cerevisiae production carbon diterpenes far proven significantly le efficient production carbon sesquiterpene counterpart in report identify modular structure geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthesis yeast major limitation diterpene yield engineer yeast farnesyl diphosphate synthase erg p produce geranylgeranyl diphosphate using combination protein genetic engineering achieve significant improvement production sclareol several isoprenoids including ci abienol abietadiene carotene we also report development yeast strain carrying engineered erg p support efficient isoprenoid production used dedicated chassis diterpene production biosynthetic pathway elucidation the design developed applied production ggpp derived isoprenoid compatible yeast terpene production platform,low

The heterologous expression of terpene synthases in microbial hosts has opened numerous possibilities for bioproduction of desirable metabolites. Photosynthetic microbial hosts present a sustainable alternative to traditional fermentative systems, using freely available (sun)light and carbon dioxide as inputs for bio-production. Here, we report the expression of a patchoulol synthase from Pogostemon cablin Benth in the model green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The sesquiterpenoid patchoulol was produced from the alga and was used as a marker of sesquiterpenoid production capacity. A novel strategy for gene loading was employed and patchoulol was produced up to 922±242 µg g-1 CDW in six days. We additionally investigated the effect of carbon source on sesquiterpenoid productivity from C. reinhardtii in scale-up batch cultivations.

394,"Enantiospecific (+)- and (-)-germacrene D synthases, cloned from goldenrod, reveal a functionally active variant of the universal isoprenoid-biosynthesis aspartate-rich motif","Abstract

The naturally occurring, volatile sesquiterpene hydrocarbon germacrene D has strong effects on insect behaviour and genes encoding enzymes that produce this compound are of interest in the study of plant–insect interactions and in a number of biotechnological approaches to pest control. Goldenrod, Solidago canadensis, is unusual in that it produces both enantiomers of germacrene D. Two new sesquiterpene synthase cDNAs, designated Sc11 and Sc19, have been isolated from goldenrod and functional expression in Escherichia coli identified Sc11 as (+)-germacrene D synthase and Sc19 as (-)-germacrene D synthase. Thus, the enantiomers of germacrene D are the products of separate, but closely related (85% amino-acid identity), enzymes. Unlike other sesquiterpene synthases and the related monoterpene synthases and prenyl transferases, which contain the characteristic amino-acid motif DDXX(D, E), Sc11 is unusual in that this motif occurs as 303NDTYD. Mutagenesis of this motif to 303DDTYD gave rise to an enzyme that fully retained (+)-germacrene D synthase activity. The converse mutation in Sc19 (D303N) resulted in a less efficient but functional enzyme. Mutagenesis of position 303 to glutamate in both enzymes resulted in loss of activity. These results indicate that the magnesium ion-binding role of the first aspartate in the DDXXD motif may not be as critical as previously thought. Further amino-acid sequence comparisons and molecular modelling of the enzyme structures revealed that very subtle changes to the active site of this family of enzymes are required to alter the reaction pathway to form, in this case, different enantiomers from the same enzyme-bound carbocationic intermediate.",abstract the naturally occurring volatile sesquiterpene hydrocarbon germacrene d strong effect insect behaviour gene encoding enzyme produce compound interest study plant insect interaction number biotechnological approach pest control goldenrod solidago canadensis unusual produce enantiomer germacrene d two new sesquiterpene synthase cdnas designated sc sc isolated goldenrod functional expression escherichia coli identified sc germacrene d synthase sc germacrene d synthase thus enantiomer germacrene d product separate closely related amino acid identity enzyme unlike sesquiterpene synthases related monoterpene synthases prenyl transferase contain characteristic amino acid motif ddxx d e sc unusual motif occurs ndtyd mutagenesis motif ddtyd gave rise enzyme fully retained germacrene d synthase activity the converse mutation sc d n resulted le efficient functional enzyme mutagenesis position glutamate enzyme resulted loss activity these result indicate magnesium ion binding role first aspartate ddxxd motif may critical previously thought further amino acid sequence comparison molecular modelling enzyme structure revealed subtle change active site family enzyme required alter reaction pathway form case different enantiomer enzyme bound carbocationic intermediate,low
395,Engineered protein degradation of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase is an effective regulatory mechanism to increase monoterpene production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Abstract

Monoterpene production in Saccharomyces cerevisae requires the introduction of heterologous monoterpene synthases (MTSs). The endogenous farnesyl pyrosphosphate synthase (FPPS; Erg20p) competes with MTSs for the precursor geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), which limits the production of monoterpenes. ERG20 is an essential gene that cannot be deleted and transcriptional down-regulation of ERG20 has failed to improve monoterpene production. Here, we investigated an N-degron-dependent protein degradation strategy to down-regulate Erg20p activity. Degron tagging decreased GFP protein half-life drastically to 1?h (degron K3K15) or 15?min (degrons KN113 and KN119). Degron tagging of ERG20 was therefore paired with a sterol responsive promoter to ensure sufficient metabolic flux to essential downstream sterols despite the severe destabilisation effect of degron tagging. A dual monoterpene/sesquiterpene (linalool/nerolidol) synthase, AcNES1, was used as a reporter of intracellular GPP and FPP production. Transcription of the synthetic pathway was controlled by either constitutive or diauxie-inducible promoters. A combination of degron K3K15 and the ERG1 promoter increased linalool titre by 27-fold to 11?mg?L-1 in the strain with constitutive promoter constructs, and by 17-fold to 18?mg?L-1 in the strain with diauxie-inducible promoter constructs. The sesquiterpene nerolidol remained the major product in both strains. The same strategies were applied to construct a limonene-producing strain, which produced 76?mg?L-1 in batch cultivation. The FPPS regulation method developed here successfully redirected metabolic flux toward monoterpene production. Examination of growth defects in various strains suggested that the intracellular FPP concentration had a significant effect on growth rate. Further strategies are required to balance intracellular production of FPP and GPP so as to maximise monoterpene production without impacting on cellular growth.",abstract monoterpene production saccharomyces cerevisae requires introduction heterologous monoterpene synthases mtss the endogenous farnesyl pyrosphosphate synthase fpps erg p competes mtss precursor geranyl pyrophosphate gpp limit production monoterpenes erg essential gene cannot deleted transcriptional regulation erg failed improve monoterpene production here investigated n degron dependent protein degradation strategy regulate erg p activity degron tagging decreased gfp protein half life drastically h degron k k min degrons kn kn degron tagging erg therefore paired sterol responsive promoter ensure sufficient metabolic flux essential downstream sterol despite severe destabilisation effect degron tagging a dual monoterpene sesquiterpene linalool nerolidol synthase acnes used reporter intracellular gpp fpp production transcription synthetic pathway controlled either constitutive diauxie inducible promoter a combination degron k k erg promoter increased linalool titre fold mg l strain constitutive promoter construct fold mg l strain diauxie inducible promoter construct the sesquiterpene nerolidol remained major product strain the strategy applied construct limonene producing strain produced mg l batch cultivation the fpps regulation method developed successfully redirected metabolic flux toward monoterpene production examination growth defect various strain suggested intracellular fpp concentration significant effect growth rate further strategy required balance intracellular production fpp gpp maximise monoterpene production without impacting cellular growth,high
396,Engineering metabolic pathways in Amycolatopsis japonicum for the optimization of the precursor supply for heterologous brasilicardin congeners production,"Abstract

The isoprenoid brasilicardin A is a promising immunosuppressant compound with a unique mode of action, high potency and reduced toxicity compared to today's standard drugs. However, production of brasilicardin has been hampered since the producer strain Nocardia terpenica IFM0406 synthesizes brasilicardin in only low amounts and is a biosafety level 2 organism. Previously, we were able to heterologously express the brasilicardin gene cluster in the nocardioform actinomycete Amycolatopsis japonicum. Four brasilicardin congeners, intermediates of the BraA biosynthesis, were produced. Since chemical synthesis of the brasilicardin core structure has remained elusive we intended to produce high amounts of the brasilicardin backbone for semi synthesis and derivatization. Therefore, we used a metabolic engineering approach to increase heterologous production of brasilicardin in A. japonicum. Simultaneous heterologous expression of genes encoding the MVA pathway and expression of diterpenoid specific prenyltransferases were used to increase the provision of the isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and to channel the precursor into the direction of diterpenoid biosynthesis. Both approaches contributed to an elevated heterologous production of the brasilicardin backbone, which can now be used as a starting point for semi synthesis of new brasilicardin congeners with better properties.",abstract the isoprenoid brasilicardin a promising immunosuppressant compound unique mode action high potency reduced toxicity compared today standard drug however production brasilicardin hampered since producer strain nocardia terpenica ifm synthesizes brasilicardin low amount biosafety level organism previously able heterologously express brasilicardin gene cluster nocardioform actinomycete amycolatopsis japonicum four brasilicardin congener intermediate braa biosynthesis produced since chemical synthesis brasilicardin core structure remained elusive intended produce high amount brasilicardin backbone semi synthesis derivatization therefore used metabolic engineering approach increase heterologous production brasilicardin a japonicum simultaneous heterologous expression gene encoding mva pathway expression diterpenoid specific prenyltransferases used increase provision isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate ipp channel precursor direction diterpenoid biosynthesis both approach contributed elevated heterologous production brasilicardin backbone used starting point semi synthesis new brasilicardin congener better property,low
397,Engineering of Tomato Glandular Trichomes for the Production of Specialized Metabolites,"Abstract

Glandular trichomes are specialized tissues on the epidermis of many plant species. On tomato they synthesize, store, and emit a variety of metabolites such as terpenoids, which play a role in the interaction with insects. Glandular trichomes are excellent tissues for studying the biosynthesis of specialized plant metabolites and are especially suitable targets for metabolic engineering. Here we describe the strategy for engineering tomato glandular trichomes, first with a transient expression system to provide proof of trichome specificity of selected promoters. Using microparticle bombardment, the trichome specificity of a terpene-synthase promoter could be validated in a relatively fast way. Second, we describe a method for stable expression of genes of interest in trichomes. Trichome-specific expression of another terpene-synthase promoter driving the yellow-fluorescence protein-gene is presented. Finally, we describe a case of the overexpression of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS), specifically in tomato glandular trichomes, providing an important precursor in the biosynthetic pathway of sesquiterpenoids. FPS was targeted to the plastid aiming to engineer sesquiterpenoid production, but interestingly leading to a loss of monoterpenoid production in the transgenic tomato trichomes. With this example we show that trichomes are amenable to engineering though, even with knowledge of a biochemical pathway, the result of such engineering can be unexpected.",abstract glandular trichomes specialized tissue epidermis many plant specie on tomato synthesize store emit variety metabolite terpenoids play role interaction insect glandular trichomes excellent tissue studying biosynthesis specialized plant metabolite especially suitable target metabolic engineering here describe strategy engineering tomato glandular trichomes first transient expression system provide proof trichome specificity selected promoter using microparticle bombardment trichome specificity terpene synthase promoter could validated relatively fast way second describe method stable expression gene interest trichomes trichome specific expression another terpene synthase promoter driving yellow fluorescence protein gene presented finally describe case overexpression farnesyl diphosphate synthase fps specifically tomato glandular trichomes providing important precursor biosynthetic pathway sesquiterpenoids fps targeted plastid aiming engineer sesquiterpenoid production interestingly leading loss monoterpenoid production transgenic tomato trichomes with example show trichomes amenable engineering though even knowledge biochemical pathway result engineering unexpected,high

Primary metabolites as essential nutrients are being more intensively studied and their engineering has often been reviewed. Low molecular weight metabolites are important components of crop plants for both consumers and producers. Thus, this chapter first outlines the metabolic engineering of essential nutrients, such as essential amino acids, lipids, vitamins, and minerals, and then summarizes the recent advances in the modification of a more specific secondary metabolism for the improvement of quality traits. Essential amino acid biosynthesis is strictly regulated by some key enzymes, such as dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) in lysine (Lys) biosynthesis and anthranilate synthase in tryptophan (Trp) synthesis. Folate has received considerable attention, since its deficiency induces neural tube defects during early pregnancy. Fatty acids are another target for nutritional improvement because some of them are critical in metabolism, cardiovascular health, inflammatory responses, and blood pressure regulation.",publisher summary primary metabolite essential nutrient intensively studied engineering often reviewed low molecular weight metabolite important component crop plant consumer producer thus chapter first outline metabolic engineering essential nutrient essential amino acid lipid vitamin mineral summarizes recent advance modification specific secondary metabolism improvement quality trait essential amino acid biosynthesis strictly regulated key enzyme dihydrodipicolinate synthase dhdps lysine lys biosynthesis anthranilate synthase tryptophan trp synthesis folate received considerable attention since deficiency induces neural tube defect early pregnancy fatty acid another target nutritional improvement critical metabolism cardiovascular health inflammatory response blood pressure regulation,high

The chemical composition of the essential oil of leaves (0.9%, w/v) and twigs (0.33%, w/v) of Wollemia nobilis (Araucariaceae) – a remnant species thought to have been extinct for 65 million years – was investigated by GC/MS. The main constituents of both leaf- and twig-derived oil samples were 16-kaurene (61.8% and 38.2%, respectively) and germacrene D (9.9% and 22%). The principal difference was a considerably more pronounced sesquiterpene presence in the twig-oil, amounting to 33.5%, than in its folial counterpart (23.4%). On the contrary, while remaining the dominant group in both oil samples under investigation, diterpenoids were relatively more abundant in leaf-derived oil constituting 65.3%, versus 41.7% detected in twigs.

401,Essential oils from New Zealand manuka: triketone and other chemotypes of Leptospermum scoparium,"Abstract

The triketone chemotype of manuka, Leptospermum scoparium (Myrtaceae), is commercially important because of its antimicrobial activity. Oils from 36 individual plants on the East Cape of New Zealand all showed similar high triketone contents (>20% total triketones) with little seasonal variation. Analyses of oils from 261 individual manuka plants collected from 87 sites throughout New Zealand showed that the high triketone chemotype was localised on the East Cape, although oils with triketone levels up to 20% were found in the Marlborough Sounds area of the South Island.

402,Eucalypt smoke and wildfires: Temperature dependent emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds,"Abstract

Eucalypt contributions to biogenic sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Australia are estimated at teragram (Tg = 1012 g) amounts each year. Biogenic VOCs include plant-specific isoprenoids (isoprene and a range of terpenes) and other reactive organic compounds (i.e., acids, aldehydes and ketones). Atmospheric reactions of VOCs are numerous and many have significant environmental impact. Wildfires increase both the amounts of VOCs released and the complexity of their reactions. Proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and direct analysis in real time (DART) mass spectrometry were applied to analyze release of VOCs as a function of temperatures ranging from ambient to combustion. PTR-MS enabled trace level analysis of VOCs from a complex forest atmosphere and revealed the release of terpenes associated with leaf damage during a storm. Temperature profile studies revealed ion abundances (i.e., emissions of VOCs) could be correlated with boiling points and vapor pressures of specific compounds. PTR-MS analysis of VOCs resulting from heating fresh leaf (E. grandis) material suggested that emissions of protonated methanol (m/z 33) and protonated acetaldehyde (m/z 45) were greatest at ~60 °C while m/z 137 and 153 (associated with a series of terpenes) showed monotonic increases in ion abundance over a wide temperature range from ambient to 200 °C. GCMS analysis of fresh and senescent leaves of E. grandis showed that a series of VOCs (ethylvinylketone, diethylketone, 2-ethylfuran, hexanal and hexenals) are present only in fresh leaves while several terpenes (a and ß pinenes, a-phellandrene, eucalyptol, ?-terpinene) were common in both. DART analysis of fresh leaf and stem of E. sideroxylon identified tissue-specific VOCs (e.g., methanol and ethanol were more abundant in stems). PTR-MS combustion studies of senescent leaves (E. grandis) identified two distinct, temperature-dependent VOC compositions. Before the appearance of smoke, the composition of VOCs remained consistent and correlated well with various naturally occurring isoprenoids, as observed in temperature profile studies. Sampling of eucalypt smoke suggested ions (m/z 75, 85, 87, 99, 111 and 125) correlated with protonated mass of oxygenated aldehydes, ketones, furans and substituted benzenes, and were due to pyrolysis of polycarbohydrates (cellulose and lignin) that are common in many types of wood.",abstract eucalypt contribution biogenic source volatile organic compound vocs australia estimated teragram tg g amount year biogenic vocs include plant specific isoprenoids isoprene range terpene reactive organic compound e acid aldehyde ketone atmospheric reaction vocs numerous many significant environmental impact wildfires increase amount vocs released complexity reaction proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry ptr ms gas chromatography mass spectrometry gcms direct analysis real time dart mass spectrometry applied analyze release vocs function temperature ranging ambient combustion ptr ms enabled trace level analysis vocs complex forest atmosphere revealed release terpene associated leaf damage storm temperature profile study revealed ion abundance e emission vocs could correlated boiling point vapor pressure specific compound ptr ms analysis vocs resulting heating fresh leaf e grandis material suggested emission protonated methanol z protonated acetaldehyde z greatest c z associated series terpene showed monotonic increase ion abundance wide temperature range ambient c gcms analysis fresh senescent leaf e grandis showed series vocs ethylvinylketone diethylketone ethylfuran hexanal hexenals present fresh leaf several terpene pinenes phellandrene eucalyptol terpinene common dart analysis fresh leaf stem e sideroxylon identified tissue specific vocs e g methanol ethanol abundant stem ptr ms combustion study senescent leaf e grandis identified two distinct temperature dependent voc composition before appearance smoke composition vocs remained consistent correlated well various naturally occurring isoprenoids observed temperature profile study sampling eucalypt smoke suggested ion z correlated protonated mass oxygenated aldehyde ketone furan substituted benzene due pyrolysis polycarbohydrates cellulose lignin common many type wood,low
403,Evolution of isoprene emission capacity in plants,"Light-dependent de novo volatile isoprene emission by terrestrial plants (approximately 2% of carbon fixed during photosynthesis) contributes as much as 0.5 Pg C/year to the global carbon cycle. Although most plant taxa exhibit either constitutive or inducible monoterpene emissions, the evolution of isoprene emission capacity in multiple lineages has remained unexplained. Based on the predominant occurrence of isoprene emission capacity in long-lived, fast-growing woody plants; the relationship between ‘metabolic scope’ of tree genera and their species richness; and the proposed role of high growth rates and long generation times in accelerating molecular evolution, we hypothesise that long-lived plant genera with inherently high speciation rates have repeatedly acquired and lost the capacity to emit isoprene in their evolutionary history.",light dependent de novo volatile isoprene emission terrestrial plant approximately carbon fixed photosynthesis contributes much pg c year global carbon cycle although plant taxon exhibit either constitutive inducible monoterpene emission evolution isoprene emission capacity multiple lineage remained unexplained based predominant occurrence isoprene emission capacity long lived fast growing woody plant relationship metabolic scope tree genus specie richness proposed role high growth rate long generation time accelerating molecular evolution hypothesise long lived plant genus inherently high speciation rate repeatedly acquired lost capacity emit isoprene evolutionary history,low
404,Evolution of root-specific carotenoid precursor pathways for apocarotenoid signal biogenesis,"Abstract

Various cleavage products of C40 carotenoid substrates are formed preferentially or exclusively in roots. Such apocarotenoid signaling or regulatory compounds differentially induced in roots during environmental stress responses including root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi include ABA, strigolactones and C13 a-ionol/C14 mycorradicin derivatives. The low carotenoid levels in roots raise the question of whether there is a regulated precursor supply channeled into apocarotenoid formation distinct from default carotenoid pathways. This review describes root-specific isogene components of carotenoid pathways toward apocarotenoid formation, highlighting a new PSY3 class of phytoene synthase genes in dicots. It is clearly distinct from the monocot PSY3 class co-regulated with ABA formation. At least two members of the exclusive dicot PSY3s are regulated by nutrient stress and mycorrhization. This newly recognized dicot PSY3 (dPSY3 vs. mPSY3 from monocots) class probably represents an ancestral branch in the evolution of the plant phytoene synthase family. The evolutionary history of PSY genes is compared with the evolution of MEP pathway isogenes encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthases (DXS), particularly DXS2, which is co-regulated with dPSY3s in mycorrhizal roots. Such stress-inducible isoforms for rate-limiting steps in root carotenogenesis might be components of multi-enzyme complexes committed to apocarotenoid rather than to carotenoid formation.",abstract various cleavage product c carotenoid substrate formed preferentially exclusively root such apocarotenoid signaling regulatory compound differentially induced root environmental stress response including root colonization arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi include aba strigolactones c ionol c mycorradicin derivative the low carotenoid level root raise question whether regulated precursor supply channeled apocarotenoid formation distinct default carotenoid pathway this review describes root specific isogene component carotenoid pathway toward apocarotenoid formation highlighting new psy class phytoene synthase gene dicot it clearly distinct monocot psy class co regulated aba formation at least two member exclusive dicot psy regulated nutrient stress mycorrhization this newly recognized dicot psy dpsy v mpsy monocot class probably represents ancestral branch evolution plant phytoene synthase family the evolutionary history psy gene compared evolution mep pathway isogenes encoding deoxy xylulose phosphate synthases dxs particularly dxs co regulated dpsy mycorrhizal root such stress inducible isoforms rate limiting step root carotenogenesis might component multi enzyme complex committed apocarotenoid rather carotenoid formation,low
405,Expression profiling of various genes during the fruit development and ripening of mango,"Abstract

Mango (Mangifera indica L. cv. Alphonso) development and ripening are the programmed processes; conventional indices and volatile markers help to determine agronomically important stages of fruit life (fruit-setting, harvesting maturity and ripening climacteric). However, more and precise markers are required to understand this programming; apparently, fruit's transcriptome can be a good source of such markers. Therefore, we isolated 18 genes related to the physiology and biochemistry of the fruit and profiled their expression in developing and ripening fruits, flowers and leaves of mango using relative quantitation PCR. In most of the tissues, genes related to primary metabolism, abiotic stress, ethylene response and protein turnover showed high expression as compared to that of the genes related to flavor production. Metallothionin and/or ethylene-response transcription factor showed highest level of transcript abundance in all the tissues. Expressions of mono- and sesquiterpene synthases and 14–3–3 lowered during ripening; whereas, that of lipoxygenase, ethylene-response factor and ubiquitin-protein ligase increased during ripening. Based on these expression profiles, flower showed better positive correlation with developing and ripening fruits than leaf. Most of the genes showed their least expression on the second day of harvest, suggesting that harvesting signals significantly affect the fruit metabolism. Important stages in the fruit life were clearly indicated by the significant changes in the expression levels of various genes. These indications complemented those from the previous analyses of fruit development, ripening and volatile emission, revealing the harmony between physiological, biochemical and molecular activities of the fruit.",abstract mango mangifera indica l cv alphonso development ripening programmed process conventional index volatile marker help determine agronomically important stage fruit life fruit setting harvesting maturity ripening climacteric however precise marker required understand programming apparently fruit transcriptome good source marker therefore isolated gene related physiology biochemistry fruit profiled expression developing ripening fruit flower leaf mango using relative quantitation pcr in tissue gene related primary metabolism abiotic stress ethylene response protein turnover showed high expression compared gene related flavor production metallothionin ethylene response transcription factor showed highest level transcript abundance tissue expressions mono sesquiterpene synthases lowered ripening whereas lipoxygenase ethylene response factor ubiquitin protein ligase increased ripening based expression profile flower showed better positive correlation developing ripening fruit leaf most gene showed least expression second day harvest suggesting harvesting signal significantly affect fruit metabolism important stage fruit life clearly indicated significant change expression level various gene these indication complemented previous analysis fruit development ripening volatile emission revealing harmony physiological biochemical molecular activity fruit,low
406,Five TPSs are responsible for volatile terpenoid biosynthesis in Albizia julibrissin,"Abstract

Silk tree, Albizia julibrissin Duraz, is an old ornamental plant and extensively cultivated in Asia. Previous works have discovered that the terpenoids were the dominating compounds in the floral VOC of A. julibrissin, however the biosynthesis of these terpenoids was poorly understood so far. Here, 11 terpene synthase genes (TPSs) were identified by transcriptome sequencing that fell into TPS-a, TPS-b and TPS-g subfamilies. The enzymatic activity tests showed that five genes were functional: AjTPS2 was a sesquiterpene synthase and produced a-farnesene and (Z, E)-ß-farnesene; AjTPS5 was able to catalyze the formation of five monoterpenes and nine sesquiterpenes; AjTPS7, AjTPS9 and AjTPS10 were dedicated monoterpene synthases, as AjTPS7 and AjTPS10 formed the single product ß-ocimene and linalool, respectively, and AjTPS9 produced ?-terpinene with other three monoterpenes. More importantly, the main catalytic products of the characterized AjTPSs were consistent with the terpenoids observed in A. julibrissin volatiles. Combining terpene chemistry, TPSs biochemical activities and gene expression analysis, we demonstrate that AjTPS2, AjTPS5, AjTPS7, AjTPS9 and AjTPS10 are responsible for the volatile terpenoids biosynthesis in A. julibrissin.",abstract silk tree albizia julibrissin duraz old ornamental plant extensively cultivated asia previous work discovered terpenoids dominating compound floral voc a julibrissin however biosynthesis terpenoids poorly understood far here terpene synthase gene tpss identified transcriptome sequencing fell tps tps b tps g subfamily the enzymatic activity test showed five gene functional ajtps sesquiterpene synthase produced farnesene z e farnesene ajtps able catalyze formation five monoterpenes nine sesquiterpenes ajtps ajtps ajtps dedicated monoterpene synthases ajtps ajtps formed single product ocimene linalool respectively ajtps produced terpinene three monoterpenes more importantly main catalytic product characterized ajtpss consistent terpenoids observed a julibrissin volatile combining terpene chemistry tpss biochemical activity gene expression analysis demonstrate ajtps ajtps ajtps ajtps ajtps responsible volatile terpenoids biosynthesis a julibrissin,low
407,Floral scent: Regulation and role of MYB transcription factors,"Abstract

Floral scent plays a vital role in reproduction, including attracting pollinators to ensure that fertilization occurs in several plants. In addition, floral scents are widely applied in perfumes, flavors, cosmetics and medicinal substances. Floral scents mediate ecological interactions and have a primary function of attracting visitors and pollinators. Due to the importance of floral scents in plant biology, basic research on flora scent through breeding technology or applications of biotechnology in is still needed. In plants, floral volatile organic compounds (VOC) are categorized into terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids and fatty acid derivatives. Several transcription factors are involved in secondary metabolite pathways, including floral scents. Transcriptional regulation of these biosynthesis pathways involves V-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) protein transcription factors, which play a prominent role in flowers. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of floral scent biosynthesis. Thus far, the engineering of the metabolic pathways responsible for producing floral scents has mainly focused on the final steps of volatile compound generation. In this review, we summarize recent research on the importance and emission of floral scents and emphasize the role of the identified MYB transcription factors in regulating floral volatile metabolism.",abstract floral scent play vital role reproduction including attracting pollinator ensure fertilization occurs several plant in addition floral scent widely applied perfume flavor cosmetic medicinal substance floral scent mediate ecological interaction primary function attracting visitor pollinator due importance floral scent plant biology basic research flora scent breeding technology application biotechnology still needed in plant floral volatile organic compound voc categorized terpenoids phenylpropanoids benzenoids fatty acid derivative several transcription factor involved secondary metabolite pathway including floral scent transcriptional regulation biosynthesis pathway involves v myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog myb protein transcription factor play prominent role flower however little known transcriptional regulation floral scent biosynthesis thus far engineering metabolic pathway responsible producing floral scent mainly focused final step volatile compound generation in review summarize recent research importance emission floral scent emphasize role identified myb transcription factor regulating floral volatile metabolism,low
408,Four terpene synthases produce major compounds of the gypsy moth feeding-induced volatile blend of Populus trichocarpa,"Abstract

After herbivore damage, many plants increase their emission of volatile compounds, with terpenes usually comprising the major group of induced volatiles. Populus trichocarpa is the first woody species with a fully sequenced genome, enabling rapid molecular approaches towards characterization of volatile terpene biosynthesis in this and other poplar species. We identified and characterized four terpene synthases (PtTPS1–4) from P. trichocarpa which form major terpene compounds of the volatile blend induced by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) feeding. The enzymes were heterologously expressed and assayed with potential prenyl diphosphate substrates. PtTPS1 and PtTPS2 accepted only farnesyl diphosphate and produced (-)-germacrene D and (E,E)-a-farnesene as their major products, respectively. In contrast, PtTPS3 and PtTPS4 showed both mono- and sesquiterpene synthase activity. They produce the acyclic terpene alcohols linalool and nerolidol but exhibited opposite stereospecificity. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of the respective terpene synthase genes was induced after feeding of gypsy moth caterpillars. The TPS enzyme products may play important roles in indirect defense of poplar to herbivores and in mediating intra- and inter-plant signaling.",abstract after herbivore damage many plant increase emission volatile compound terpene usually comprising major group induced volatile populus trichocarpa first woody specie fully sequenced genome enabling rapid molecular approach towards characterization volatile terpene biosynthesis poplar specie we identified characterized four terpene synthases pttps p trichocarpa form major terpene compound volatile blend induced gypsy moth lymantria dispar feeding the enzyme heterologously expressed assayed potential prenyl diphosphate substrate pttps pttps accepted farnesyl diphosphate produced germacrene d e e farnesene major product respectively in contrast pttps pttps showed mono sesquiterpene synthase activity they produce acyclic terpene alcohol linalool nerolidol exhibited opposite stereospecificity qrt pcr analysis revealed expression respective terpene synthase gene induced feeding gypsy moth caterpillar the tps enzyme product may play important role indirect defense poplar herbivore mediating intra inter plant signaling,low
409,Molecular regulation of santalol biosynthesis in Santalum album L.,"Abstract

Santalum album L. commonly known as East-Indian sandal or chandan is a hemiparasitic tree of family santalaceae. Santalol is a bioprospecting molecule present in sandalwood and any effort towards metabolic engineering of this important moiety would require knowledge on gene regulation. Santalol is a sesquiterpene synthesized through mevalonate or non-mevalonate pathways. First step of santalol biosynthesis involves head to tail condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) with its allylic co-substrate dimethyl allyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) to produce geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP; C10 — a monoterpene). GPP upon one additional condensation with IPP produces farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP; C15 — an open chain sesquiterpene). Both the reactions are catalyzed by farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDS). Santalene synthase (SS), a terpene cyclase catalyzes cyclization of open ring FPP into a mixture of cyclic sesquiterpenes such as a-santalene, epi-ß-santalene, ß-santalene and exo bergamotene, the main constituents of sandal oil. The objective of the present work was to generate a comprehensive knowledge on the genes involved in santalol production and study their molecular regulation. To achieve this, sequences encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase and santalene synthase were isolated from sandalwood using suppression subtraction hybridization and 2D gel electrophoresis technology. Functional characterization of both the genes was done through enzyme assays and tissue-specific expression of both the genes was studied. To our knowledge, this is the first report on studies on molecular regulation, and tissue-specific expression of the genes involved in santalol biosynthesis.",abstract santalum album l commonly known east indian sandal chandan hemiparasitic tree family santalaceae santalol bioprospecting molecule present sandalwood effort towards metabolic engineering important moiety would require knowledge gene regulation santalol sesquiterpene synthesized mevalonate non mevalonate pathway first step santalol biosynthesis involves head tail condensation isopentenyl pyrophosphate ipp allylic co substrate dimethyl allyl pyrophosphate dmapp produce geranyl pyrophosphate gpp c monoterpene gpp upon one additional condensation ipp produce farnesyl pyrophosphate fpp c open chain sesquiterpene both reaction catalyzed farnesyl diphosphate synthase fds santalene synthase ss terpene cyclase catalyzes cyclization open ring fpp mixture cyclic sesquiterpenes santalene epi santalene santalene exo bergamotene main constituent sandal oil the objective present work generate comprehensive knowledge gene involved santalol production study molecular regulation to achieve sequence encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase santalene synthase isolated sandalwood using suppression subtraction hybridization d gel electrophoresis technology functional characterization gene done enzyme assay tissue specific expression gene studied to knowledge first report study molecular regulation tissue specific expression gene involved santalol biosynthesis,low
410,Mono- and sesquiterpene release from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaves upon mild and severe heat stress and through recovery: From gene expression to emission responses,"Abstract

Plants frequently experience heat ramps of various severities, but how and to what degree plant metabolic activity recovers from mild and severe heat stress is poorly understood. In this study, we exposed the constitutive terpene emitter, Solanum. lycopersicum leaves to mild (37 and 41 °C), moderate (46 °C) and severe (49 °C) heat ramps of 5 min and monitored foliage photosynthetic activity, lipoxygenase pathway volatile (LOX), and mono- and sesquiterpene emissions and expression of two terpene synthase genes, ß-phellandrene synthase and (E)-ß-caryophyllene/a-humulene synthase, through a 24 h recovery period upon return to pre-stress conditions. Leaf monoterpene emissions were dominated by ß-phellandrene and sesquiterpene emissions by (E)-ß-caryophyllene, and thus, these two terpene synthase genes were representative for the two volatile terpene classes. Photosynthetic characteristics partly recovered under moderate heat stress, and very limited recovery was observed under severe stress. All stress treatments resulted in elicitation of LOX emissions that declined during recovery. Enhanced mono- and sesquiterpene emissions were observed immediately after the heat treatment, but the emissions decreased even to below the control treatment during recovery between 2 and 10 h, and raised again by 24 h. The expression of ß-phellandrene and (E)-ß-caryophyllene synthase genes decreased between 2 and 10 h after heat stress, and recovered to pre-stress level in mild heat stress treatment by 24 h. Overall, this study demonstrates a highly sensitive heat response of terpenoid synthesis that is mainly controlled by gene level responses under mild stress, while severe stress leads to non-recoverable declines in foliage physiological and gene expression activities.",abstract plants frequently experience heat ramp various severity degree plant metabolic activity recovers mild severe heat stress poorly understood in study exposed constitutive terpene emitter solanum lycopersicum leaf mild c moderate c severe c heat ramp min monitored foliage photosynthetic activity lipoxygenase pathway volatile lox mono sesquiterpene emission expression two terpene synthase gene phellandrene synthase e caryophyllene humulene synthase h recovery period upon return pre stress condition leaf monoterpene emission dominated phellandrene sesquiterpene emission e caryophyllene thus two terpene synthase gene representative two volatile terpene class photosynthetic characteristic partly recovered moderate heat stress limited recovery observed severe stress all stress treatment resulted elicitation lox emission declined recovery enhanced mono sesquiterpene emission observed immediately heat treatment emission decreased even control treatment recovery h raised h the expression phellandrene e caryophyllene synthase gene decreased h heat stress recovered pre stress level mild heat stress treatment h overall study demonstrates highly sensitive heat response terpenoid synthesis mainly controlled gene level response mild stress severe stress lead non recoverable decline foliage physiological gene expression activity,low

MTPSLs are structurally and phylogenetically more related to bacterial and fungal terpene synthases than to typical plant terpene synthases. They are widely distributed in nonseed plants but absent in seed plants and green algae. Much of the terpene diversity in nonseed plants is presumed to be determined by MTPSLs.

415,Nerolidol production in agroinfiltrated tobacco: Impact of protein stability and membrane targeting of strawberry (Fragraria ananassa) NEROLIDOL SYNTHASE1,"Abstract

The sesquiterpene alcohol nerolidol, synthesized from farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), mediates plant-insect interactions across multiple trophic levels with major implications for pest management in agriculture. We compared nerolidol engineering strategies in tobacco using agroinfiltration to transiently express strawberry (Fragraria ananassa) linalool/nerolidol synthase (FaNES1) either at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or in the cytosol as a soluble protein. Using solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME-GCMS), we have determined that FaNES1 directed to the ER via fusion to the transmembrane domain of squalene synthase or hydroxymethylglutaryl – CoA reductase displayed significant improvements in terms of transcript levels, protein accumulation, and volatile production when compared to its cytosolic form. However, the highest levels of nerolidol production were observed when FaNES1 was fused to GFP and expressed in the cytosol. This SPME-GCMS method afforded a limit of detection and quantification of 1.54 and 5.13?pg, respectively. Nerolidol production levels, which ranged from 0.5 to 3.0?µg/g F.W., correlated more strongly to the accumulation of recombinant protein than transcript level, the former being highest in FaNES-GFP transfected plants. These results indicate that while the ER may represent an enriched source of FDP that can be exploited in metabolic engineering, protein accumulation is a better predictor of sesquiterpene production.",abstract the sesquiterpene alcohol nerolidol synthesized farnesyl diphosphate fdp mediates plant insect interaction across multiple trophic level major implication pest management agriculture we compared nerolidol engineering strategy tobacco using agroinfiltration transiently express strawberry fragraria ananassa linalool nerolidol synthase fanes either endoplasmic reticulum er cytosol soluble protein using solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry spme gcms determined fanes directed er via fusion transmembrane domain squalene synthase hydroxymethylglutaryl coa reductase displayed significant improvement term transcript level protein accumulation volatile production compared cytosolic form however highest level nerolidol production observed fanes fused gfp expressed cytosol this spme gcms method afforded limit detection quantification pg respectively nerolidol production level ranged g g f w correlated strongly accumulation recombinant protein transcript level former highest fanes gfp transfected plant these result indicate er may represent enriched source fdp exploited metabolic engineering protein accumulation better predictor sesquiterpene production,low

419,Nonradioactive Assay for Cellular Dimethylallyl Diphosphate,"Abstract

A sensitive, nonradioactive method was developed to measure cellular levels of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), a central intermediate of isoprenoid metabolism in nature. The assay is based on the hydrolysis of DMAPP in acid to the volatile hydrocarbon isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), with subsequent analysis of isoprene by headspace gas chromatography with reduction gas detection. In the assay, cell samples are directly acidified with 4 M H2SO4 in sealed reaction vials. Therefore, there is no need to extract metabolites, purify them, and keep them stable prior to analysis, and degradative enzymatic activities are destroyed. DMAPP levels of 23 ± 4 nmol (g fresh weight)-1 [ca. 85 nmol (g dry weight)-1] and 80 ± 14 nmol (g fresh weight)-1 [ca. 296 nmol (g dry weight)-1] were measured in dark- and light-adapted leaves of Populus deltoides (Eastern cottonwood), respectively.

420,Nonradioactive assay for detecting isoprenyl diphosphate synthase activity in crude plant extracts using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,"Abstract

Terpenoids form the largest class of plant metabolites involved in primary and secondary metabolism. Isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs) catalyze the condensation of the C5 terpenoid building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, to form geranyl diphosphate (C10), farnesyl diphosphate (C15), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C20). These branch point reactions control the flow of metabolites that act as precursors to each of the major terpene classes—monoterpenes, sequiterpenes, and diterpenes, respectively. Thus accurate and easily performed assays of IDS enzyme activity are critical to increase our knowledge about the regulation of terpene biosynthesis. Here we describe a new and sensitive nonradioactive method for carrying out IDS assays using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to detect the short-chain prenyl diphosphate products directly without dephosphorylation. Furthermore, we were able to separate cisoid and transoid isomers of both C10 enzyme products (geranyl diphosphate and neryl diphosphate) and three C15 products [(E,E)-, (Z,E)-, and (Z,Z)-farnesyl diphosphate]. By applying the method to crude protein extracts from various organs of Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana attenuata, Populus trichocarpa, and Picea abies, we could determine their IDS activity in a reproducible fashion.",abstract terpenoids form largest class plant metabolite involved primary secondary metabolism isoprenyl diphosphate synthases idss catalyze condensation c terpenoid building block isopentenyl diphosphate dimethylallyl diphosphate form geranyl diphosphate c farnesyl diphosphate c geranylgeranyl diphosphate c these branch point reaction control flow metabolite act precursor major terpene class monoterpenes sequiterpenes diterpenes respectively thus accurate easily performed assay ids enzyme activity critical increase knowledge regulation terpene biosynthesis here describe new sensitive nonradioactive method carrying ids assay using liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms detect short chain prenyl diphosphate product directly without dephosphorylation furthermore able separate cisoid transoid isomer c enzyme product geranyl diphosphate neryl diphosphate three c product e e z e z z farnesyl diphosphate by applying method crude protein extract various organ arabidopsis thaliana nicotiana attenuata populus trichocarpa picea abies could determine ids activity reproducible fashion,low

422,"Nutritional implications of ginger: chemistry, biological activities and signaling pathways","Abstract

Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) has been used as a food, spice, supplement and flavoring agent and in traditional medicines due to its beneficial characteristics such as pungency, aroma, nutrients and pharmacological activity. Ginger and ginger extracts were reported to have numerous effects, such as those on diabetes and metabolic syndrome, cholesterol levels and lipid metabolism, and inflammation, revealed by epidemiological studies. To understand the beneficial characteristics of ginger, especially its physiological and pharmacological activities at the molecular level, the biological effects of ginger constituents, such as monoterpenes (cineole, citral, limonene and a/ß-pinenes), sesquiterpenes (ß-elemene, farnesene and zerumbone), phenolics (gingerols, [6]-shogaol, [6]-paradol and zingerone) and diarylheptanoids (curcumin), and the associated signaling pathways are summarized. Ginger constituents are involved in biological activities, such as apoptosis, cell cycle/DNA damage, chromatin/epigenetic regulation, cytoskeletal regulation and adhesion, immunology and inflammation, and neuroscience, and exert their effects through specific signaling pathways associated with cell functions/mechanisms such as autophagy, cellular metabolism, mitogen-activated protein kinase and other signaling, and development/differentiation. Estrogens, such as phytoestrogens, are one of the most important bioactive materials in nature, and the molecular mechanisms of estrogen actions and the assays to detect them have been discussed. The molecular mechanisms of estrogen actions induced by ginger constituents and related applications, such as the chemoprevention of cancers, and the improvement of menopausal syndromes, osteoporosis, endometriosis, prostatic hyperplasia, polycystic ovary syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, were summarized by a comprehensive search of references to understand more about their health benefits and associated health risks.",abstract ginger zingiber officinale roscoe used food spice supplement flavoring agent traditional medicine due beneficial characteristic pungency aroma nutrient pharmacological activity ginger ginger extract reported numerous effect diabetes metabolic syndrome cholesterol level lipid metabolism inflammation revealed epidemiological study to understand beneficial characteristic ginger especially physiological pharmacological activity molecular level biological effect ginger constituent monoterpenes cineole citral limonene pinenes sesquiterpenes elemene farnesene zerumbone phenolic gingerol shogaol paradol zingerone diarylheptanoids curcumin associated signaling pathway summarized ginger constituent involved biological activity apoptosis cell cycle dna damage chromatin epigenetic regulation cytoskeletal regulation adhesion immunology inflammation neuroscience exert effect specific signaling pathway associated cell function mechanism autophagy cellular metabolism mitogen activated protein kinase signaling development differentiation estrogens phytoestrogens one important bioactive material nature molecular mechanism estrogen action assay detect discussed the molecular mechanism estrogen action induced ginger constituent related application chemoprevention cancer improvement menopausal syndrome osteoporosis endometriosis prostatic hyperplasia polycystic ovary syndrome alzheimer disease summarized comprehensive search reference understand health benefit associated health risk,low

424,On the biosynthesis and evolution of apocarotenoid plant growth regulators,"Abstract

Carotenoids are an important source of metabolites with regulatory function, which include the plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and strigolactones (SLs), and several recently identified growth regulators and signaling molecules. These carotenoid-derivatives originate from oxidative breakdown of double bonds in the carotenoid polyene, a common metabolic process that gives rise to diverse carbonyl cleavage-products known as apocarotenoids. Apocarotenoids exert biologically important functions in all taxa. In plants, they are a major regulator of plant growth, development and response to biotic and abiotic environmental stimuli, and mediate plant’s communication with surrounding organisms. In this article, we provide a general overview on the biology of plant apocarotenoids, focusing on ABA, SLs, and recently identified apocarotenoid growth regulators. Following an introduction on carotenoids, we describe plant apocarotenoid biosynthesis, signal transduction, and evolution and summarize their biological functions. Moreover, we discuss the evolution of these intriguing metabolites, which has not been adequately addressed in the literature.",abstract carotenoids important source metabolite regulatory function include plant hormone abscisic acid aba strigolactones sls several recently identified growth regulator signaling molecule these carotenoid derivative originate oxidative breakdown double bond carotenoid polyene common metabolic process give rise diverse carbonyl cleavage product known apocarotenoids apocarotenoids exert biologically important function taxon in plant major regulator plant growth development response biotic abiotic environmental stimulus mediate plant communication surrounding organism in article provide general overview biology plant apocarotenoids focusing aba sls recently identified apocarotenoid growth regulator following introduction carotenoid describe plant apocarotenoid biosynthesis signal transduction evolution summarize biological function moreover discus evolution intriguing metabolite adequately addressed literature,high
425,Opportunistic emissions of volatile isoprenoids,"Isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are synthesized and emitted by some plant species, but not all plant species have this ability. These volatile, nonessential isoprenoid compounds share the same biochemical precursors as larger essential isoprenoids such as gibberellic acids and carotenoids. They have many protective and ecological functions for the plant species that produce them, but plant species that do not produce these compounds also grow and reproduce successfully. Here, we develop an ‘opportunist hypothesis’ suggesting that (i) volatile isoprenoid production takes advantage of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which are synthesized primarily to produce essential isoprenoids, and (ii) conditions affecting synthesis of the higher isoprenoids will affect the production and emission of volatile isoprenoids.",isoprene monoterpenes sesquiterpenes synthesized emitted plant specie plant specie ability these volatile nonessential isoprenoid compound share biochemical precursor larger essential isoprenoids gibberellic acid carotenoid they many protective ecological function plant specie produce plant specie produce compound also grow reproduce successfully here develop opportunist hypothesis suggesting volatile isoprenoid production take advantage dimethylallyl diphosphate dmapp isomer isopentenyl diphosphate ipp synthesized primarily produce essential isoprenoids ii condition affecting synthesis higher isoprenoids affect production emission volatile isoprenoids,low

Floral scent and colour are key trait for many floricultural crops. Floral volatiles are biologically and economically important plant derived compounds and they play vital role in pollinator attraction, plant defense and interaction with surrounding the environment. Orchidaceae is one of the largest and most widespread families of flowering plants, with more than 25,000 species. Orchids are one of the most significant plants in ecologically adopted every habitation on earth. Floral volatiles is not limited in its role to pollinator attraction, it’s widely used for perfumes, cosmetics, flavourings and therapeutic applications. Even though biochemistry of floral volatiles is still new field for investigation.Due to importance of the plant biology orchid floral scent research were deeply needed. Analysis of the biosynthesis mechanisms involved in floral scent is necessary to understand the fine-scale molecular functions and to breed to new cultivars through floral volatile genetic engineering approaches. Now a days many researchers developed floral scent models in plants. However, little is known about the pathways responsible for floral scent in orchids, due to the long life cycle and large genome size. Only some terpenoid pathways were reported in orchids.

427,Overproduction of isoprenoids by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a synthetic grape juice medium in the absence of plant genes,"Abstract

The objective of this work is to demonstrate if the hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase Coq1p might be involved in monoterpenes synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although its currently known function in yeast is to catalyze the first step in ubiquinone biosynthesis. However, in a BY4743 laboratory strain, the presence of an empty plasmid in a chemically defined grape juice medium results in a statistically significant increase of linalool, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol. When COQ1 is overexpressed from a plasmid, the levels of the volatile isoprenoids are further increased. Furthermore, overexpression of COQ1 in the same genetic context but with a mutated farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (erg20 mutation K197E), results in statistically significant higher levels of linalool (above 750?µg/L), geraniol, a-terpineol, and the sesquiterpenes, farnesol and nerolidol (total concentration of volatile isoprenoids surpasses 1300?µg/L). We show that the levels of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that S. cerevisiae can produce, in the absence of plant genes, depend on the composition of the medium and the genetic context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest level of linalool produced by S. cerevisiae up to now. Further research will be needed for understanding how COQ1 and the medium composition might interact to increase flavor complexity of fermented beverages.",abstract the objective work demonstrate hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase coq p might involved monoterpenes synthesis saccharomyces cerevisiae although currently known function yeast catalyze first step ubiquinone biosynthesis however by laboratory strain presence empty plasmid chemically defined grape juice medium result statistically significant increase linalool e nerolidol e e farnesol when coq overexpressed plasmid level volatile isoprenoids increased furthermore overexpression coq genetic context mutated farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase erg mutation k e result statistically significant higher level linalool g l geraniol terpineol sesquiterpenes farnesol nerolidol total concentration volatile isoprenoids surpasses g l we show level monoterpenes sesquiterpenes s cerevisiae produce absence plant gene depend composition medium genetic context to best knowledge highest level linalool produced s cerevisiae further research needed understanding coq medium composition might interact increase flavor complexity fermented beverage,low

429,Photosynthetic performance and volatile organic compounds profile in Eucalyptus globulus after UVB radiation,"Abstract

Economically important forest species as Eucalyptus globulus face risks associated with climate changes, whose immediate and long-term damages are yet to account. The aim of this study was to decipher the impacts of UV-B radiation on the physiological performance and metabolome profile of leaves of Eucalyptus juvenile plants. For that, three-month-old plants were treated for two days to a total effective radiation of 12 kJ m-2. One and 11 d after treatment the samples were collected for photosynthetic analyses. UV-B did not affect the photochemical efficiency or gas exchange, but the total soluble sugars (TSS), starch levels and pigment contents were changed. Changes in TSS and pigment contents persisted in time after the end of exposure. The profile of volatile metabolites (1 and 11 days after stress removal) was analyzed by HS-SPME/GC-IT-MS, and showed abundance of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and aldehydes. One day after the stress removal, an increase of aldehydes was observed and a decrease of some monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Eleven days after stress removal, some monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes decreased to values closer to those of control. The absence of mortality, and the minor effects observed in photosynthesis suggest a high tolerance profile of this species to the UV-B dose used, which may be justified by changes at the level of primary metabolism (involving sugars) and secondary (e.g. terpenes) observed in response to UV's. The correlations of these changes with potential functional adaptations are discussed here.",abstract economically important forest specie eucalyptus globulus face risk associated climate change whose immediate long term damage yet account the aim study decipher impact uv b radiation physiological performance metabolome profile leaf eucalyptus juvenile plant for three month old plant treated two day total effective radiation kj one treatment sample collected photosynthetic analysis uv b affect photochemical efficiency gas exchange total soluble sugar tss starch level pigment content changed changes tss pigment content persisted time end exposure the profile volatile metabolite day stress removal analyzed hs spme gc it ms showed abundance monoterpenes sesquiterpenes aldehyde one day stress removal increase aldehyde observed decrease monoterpenes sesquiterpenes eleven day stress removal monoterpenes sesquiterpenes decreased value closer control the absence mortality minor effect observed photosynthesis suggest high tolerance profile specie uv b dose used may justified change level primary metabolism involving sugar secondary e g terpene observed response uv the correlation change potential functional adaptation discussed,low
430,Phylogenetically distant group of terpene synthases participates in cadinene and cedrane-type sesquiterpenes accumulation in Taiwania cryptomerioides,"Abstract

Along with the species evolution, plants have evolved ways to produce a different collection of terpenoids to accommodate its biotic and abiotic environment, and terpene synthase (TPS) is one of the major contributors to various terpene compounds. The timber of a monotypic and relictual conifer species of Cupressace, Taiwania cryptomerioides, has excellent durability, and one of the essential factors for Taiwania to resist decay and insect pests is sesquiterpene. Compared to other conifers, Taiwania has much higher abundance of cadinene-type sesquiterpenes, and the presence of cedrene-type sesquiterpenes. To understand sesquiterpene biosynthesis in Taiwania, we functionally characterized 10 T. cryptomerioides TPSs (TcTPSs) in vivo or in planta, which could catalyze sesquiterpene formation and potentially are involved in biosynthesis of diverse sesquiterpenoids in Taiwania. The distant phylogenetic relationship and the intron loss event of TcTPSs correlate to the differentiation of chemical profile Taiwania compared to other conifers. Furthermore, we identified TcTPS3 and TcTPS12 as d-cadinene synthase, and TcTPS6 as cedrol synthase, which demonstrates the important contributions of dynamic evolution in TPSs to the chemical diversity in plants.

We illustrate here that PSCs from foliar tissue, root exudates, and leaf litter effectively influence such belowground plant–plant, plant–microorganism, and plant–soil invertebrate interactions. Climatic factors can induce PSC production and select for different plant chemical types. Therefore, climate change can alter both quantitative and qualitative PSC production, and how these compounds move in the soil.

434,Plant-derived Secondary Organic Material in the Air and Ecosystems,"Biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and deposited secondary organic material (SOM) are formed by oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants. Many SOA compounds have much longer chemical lifetimes than the original VOC, and may accumulate on plant surfaces and in soil as SOM because of their low volatility. This suggests that they may have important and presently unrecognized roles in plant adaptation. Using reactive plant terpenoids as a model we propose a three-tier (atmosphere–vegetation–soil) framework to better understand the ecological and evolutionary functions of SOM. In this framework, SOA in the atmosphere is known to affect solar radiation, SOM on the plant surfaces influences the interactive organisms, and wet and dry deposition of SOM on soil affects soil organisms.",biogenic secondary organic aerosol soa deposited secondary organic material som formed oxidation volatile organic compound vocs emitted plant many soa compound much longer chemical lifetime original voc may accumulate plant surface soil som low volatility this suggests may important presently unrecognized role plant adaptation using reactive plant terpenoids model propose three tier atmosphere vegetation soil framework better understand ecological evolutionary function som in framework soa atmosphere known affect solar radiation som plant surface influence interactive organism wet dry deposition som soil affect soil organism,low

The roles that ozone and nitric oxide (NO), the chief O3 precursor, play in the antioxidative balance and inducible volatile emissions of lima bean were assessed. Exposure to O3 inhibited APX, CAT, and GR, decreased GSH content and induced emissions of (E)-ß-ocimene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, linalool, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (E)-DMNT, 2-butanone and nonanal. O3 did not induce emissions of (E)-ß-caryophyllene and appeared to reduce the antioxidative capacity of plants to a greater extent than NO and NO followed by O3 (NO/O3) treatments. There were significant differences in emissions of (E)-ß-ocimene and linalool between NO/O3 treated plants and controls, but no differences in antioxidant concentrations. A model to explain the relationships between the ascorbate–glutathione cycle and O3 and NO inducible volatiles was proposed. Our findings suggest that prior exposure to NO modulates the oxidative effect of ozone by the process of cross-tolerance, which might regulate the antioxidative system and induction of volatile organic compounds.",abstract the role ozone nitric oxide no chief o precursor play antioxidative balance inducible volatile emission lima bean assessed exposure o inhibited apx cat gr decreased gsh content induced emission e ocimene limonene cineole linalool e dimethyl nonatriene e dmnt butanone nonanal o induce emission e caryophyllene appeared reduce antioxidative capacity plant greater extent no no followed o no o treatment there significant difference emission e ocimene linalool no o treated plant control difference antioxidant concentration a model explain relationship ascorbate glutathione cycle o no inducible volatile proposed our finding suggest prior exposure no modulates oxidative effect ozone process cross tolerance might regulate antioxidative system induction volatile organic compound,low
437,Prenyltransferases catalyzing geranyldiphosphate formation in tomato fruit,"Abstract

Monoterpenes contribute either favorably or adversely to the flavor of tomato, yet modern tomato varieties generally lack monoterpenes in their fruit. The main immediate biosynthetic precursor of monoterpenes is geranyldiphosphate (GPP), produced by the action of GPP synthases (GPPSs). Plant GPPSs are often heteromeric enzymes consisting of a non-catalytic small subunit (GPPS.SSU) and a large subunit (GPPS.LSU), the latter similar to geranylgeranyldiphosphate synthases (GGPPSs) which generate longer prenylphosphate chains. We show here that LeGGPPS2, an enzyme previously reported to support carotenoid biosynthesis, can synthesize farnesyldiphosphate (FPP) and GPP in vitro, in addition to geranylgeranyldiphosphate, depending on the assay conditions. Moreover, GPP formation is favored in vitro by the interaction of LeGGPPS2 with GPPS.SSU from either Anthirrhinum majus (AmGPPS.SSU) or from a newly discovered GPPS.SSU ortholog present in the genome of M82 tomato. SlGPPS.SSU is not expressed in M82 tomato fruit but its orthologs are expressed in fruit of wild tomato relatives, such as Solanum pimpinelifollium and S. cheesmaniae that accumulate monoterpenes.",abstract monoterpenes contribute either favorably adversely flavor tomato yet modern tomato variety generally lack monoterpenes fruit the main immediate biosynthetic precursor monoterpenes geranyldiphosphate gpp produced action gpp synthases gppss plant gppss often heteromeric enzyme consisting non catalytic small subunit gpps ssu large subunit gpps lsu latter similar geranylgeranyldiphosphate synthases ggppss generate longer prenylphosphate chain we show leggpps enzyme previously reported support carotenoid biosynthesis synthesize farnesyldiphosphate fpp gpp vitro addition geranylgeranyldiphosphate depending assay condition moreover gpp formation favored vitro interaction leggpps gpps ssu either anthirrhinum majus amgpps ssu newly discovered gpps ssu ortholog present genome m tomato slgpps ssu expressed m tomato fruit orthologs expressed fruit wild tomato relative solanum pimpinelifollium s cheesmaniae accumulate monoterpenes,low

439,Production of the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene by metabolically engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum,"Abstract

The sesquiterpene (+)-valencene is an aroma compound of citrus fruits and is used to flavor foods and drinks. Biosynthesis of (+)-valencene starts from farnesyl pyrophosphate, an intermediate of carotenoid biosynthesis. Corynebacterium glutamicum, the workhorse of the million-ton scale amino acid industry, is naturally pigmented as it synthesizes the rare fifty carbon atoms (C50) containing carotenoid decaprenoxanthin. Since the carotenoid pathway of this Gram-positive bacterium has previously been engineered for efficient production of several C50 and C40 carotenoids, its potential to produce a sesquiterpene was assessed. Growth of C. glutamicum was negatively affected by (+)-valencene, but overlaying n-dodecane as organic phase for extraction of (+)-valencene was shown to be biocompatible. Heterologous expression of the (+)-valencene synthase gene from the sweet orange Citrus sinensis was not sufficient to enable (+)-valencene production, likely because provision of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) by endogenous prenyltransferases was too low. However, upon deletion of two endogenous prenyltransferase genes and heterologous expression of either FPP synthase gene ispA from Escherichia coli or ERG20 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (+)-valence production by C. sinensis valencene synthase was observed.

440,Progressive Regulation of Sesquiterpene Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin) by the miR156-Targeted SPL Transcription Factors,"Abstract

Plant metabolites vary at different stages of their life cycle. Although it is well documented that environmental factors stimulate biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, the regulation by endogenous developmental cues remains poorly understood. The microRNA156 (miR156)-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) factors function as a major age cue in regulating developmental phase transition and flowering. We show here that the miR156-targeted SPL transcription factor plays an important role in the spatiotemporal regulation of sesquiterpene biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the miR156-SPL module regulates the formation of (E)-ß-caryophyllene in the flowering stage through modulating expression of the sesquiterpene synthase gene TPS21. We demonstrated that SPL9 directly binds to TPS21 promoter and activates its expression. In the perennial fragrant herb Pogostemon cablin, the accumulation of patchouli oil, largely composed of sesquiterpenes dominated by (-)-patchoulol, is also age-regulated, and the SPL promotes biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes in elder plants by upregulating patchoulol synthase (PatPTS) gene expression. As miR156-SPLs are highly conserved in plants, our finding not only uncovers a molecular link between developmental timing and sesquiterpene production but also suggests a new strategy to engineer plants for accelerated growth with enhanced production of terpenoids.",abstract plant metabolite vary different stage life cycle although well documented environmental factor stimulate biosynthesis secondary metabolite regulation endogenous developmental cue remains poorly understood the microrna mir targeted squamosa promoter binding protein like spl factor function major age cue regulating developmental phase transition flowering we show mir targeted spl transcription factor play important role spatiotemporal regulation sesquiterpene biosynthesis in arabidopsis thaliana mir spl module regulates formation e caryophyllene flowering stage modulating expression sesquiterpene synthase gene tps we demonstrated spl directly bind tps promoter activates expression in perennial fragrant herb pogostemon cablin accumulation patchouli oil largely composed sesquiterpenes dominated patchoulol also age regulated spl promotes biosynthesis sesquiterpenes elder plant upregulating patchoulol synthase patpts gene expression as mir spls highly conserved plant finding uncovers molecular link developmental timing sesquiterpene production also suggests new strategy engineer plant accelerated growth enhanced production terpenoids,low
441,Purification and kinetic properties of elisabethatriene synthase from the coral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae,"Abstract

The Bahamian octocoral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae is the source of pseudopterosins, diterpene glycosides with potent anti-inflammatory activity. The first committed step in pseudopterosin biosynthesis comprises the cyclisation of the universal diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate to elisabethatriene. This reaction is catalysed by elisabethatriene synthase, which was purified to homogeneity from a crude coral extract. This represents the first purification to apparent homogeneity of a terpene cyclase from any marine source. The reaction kinetics of elisabethatriene synthase was examined using a steady state approach with 3H-labelled isoprenyldiphosphates varying in carbon chain length (C10, C15, C20). For the reaction of elisabethatriene synthase with its natural substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate, values of Km (2.3 × 10- 6 M), Vmax (3.4 × 104 nM elisabethatriene * s- 1) and the specificity constant (kcat / Km = 1.8 × 10- 10 M- 1 * s- 1) were comparable with diterpene cyclases from terrestrial plants. Elisabethatriene synthase also catalysed the conversion of C15 and C10 isoprenyldiphosphate analogues to monoterpene and sesquiterpene olefins, respectively. Kinetic parameters indicated that substrate specificity and Km of elisabethatriene synthase decreased with decreasing isoprenoid carbon chain length.

Isoprenoids, as the largest group of chemicals in the domains of life, constitute more than 50,000 members. These compounds consist of different numbers of isoprene units (C5H8), by which they are typically classified into hemiterpenoids (C5), monoterpenoids (C10), sesquiterpenoids (C15), diterpenoids (C20), triterpenoids (C30), and tetraterpenoids (C40). In recent years, isoprenoids have been employed as food additives, in the pharmaceutical industry, as advanced biofuels, and so on. To realize the sufficient and efficient production of valuable isoprenoids on an industrial scale, fermentation using engineered microorganisms is a promising strategy compared to traditional plant extraction and chemical synthesis. Due to the advantages of mature genetic manipulation, robustness and applicability to industrial bioprocesses, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has become an attractive microbial host for biochemical production, including that of various isoprenoids.

Those secreted from the microbial cell are of particular interest for large scale bioprocessing, since they allow for cell reuse, in situ product recovery and competitive production levels. So far, however, bioprocess strategies for fermentation and product recovery have been developed for addressing needs at the laboratory scale, rather than the process scale. Most commonly used strategies include extractive fermentations, product stripping in the gas phase, and off-line de-emulsification followed by intensive centrifugation. At the same time, current techno-economic studies at process scale have demonstrated the absolute need for significant improvements in both microorganism and process technology, for these processes to become competitive.",several apolar molecule interest production fuel chemical nowadays produced fermentation those secreted microbial cell particular interest large scale bioprocessing since allow cell reuse situ product recovery competitive production level so far however bioprocess strategy fermentation product recovery developed addressing need laboratory scale rather process scale most commonly used strategy include extractive fermentation product stripping gas phase line de emulsification followed intensive centrifugation at time current techno economic study process scale demonstrated absolute need significant improvement microorganism process technology process become competitive,low
448,Regulation of floral scent production in petunia revealed by targeted metabolomics,"Abstract

Petunia hybrida line W115 (Mitchell) has large white flowers that produce a pleasant fragrance. By applying solid phase micro extraction (SPME) techniques coupled to GC–MS analysis, volatile emission was monitored in vivo using a targeted metabolomics approach. Mature flowers released predominantly benzenoid compounds of which benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, methylbenzoate, phenylethylalcohol, iso-eugenol and benzylbenzoate were most abundant. This emission had a circadian rhythm reaching its maximum at dusk. During petal limb expansion two sesquiterpenes were emitted by the petunia flowers, tentatively identified as germacrene D and cadina-3,9-diene. In vitro analysis showed that the petal limbs and stigma were the main producers of the benzenoids and sesquiterpenes, respectively. Moreover, comparison of in vivo and in vitro analysis indicated that volatiles were not stored during periods of low emission but rather were synthesized de novo. DNA-microarray analysis revealed that genes of the pathways leading to the production of volatile benzenoids were upregulated late during the day, preceding the increase of volatile emission. RNA-gel blot analyses confirmed that the levels of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) synthase transcripts increased towards the evening. Our results suggest that the circadian production of volatile benzenoids in petunia W115 is, at least partly, regulated at the transcript level.",abstract petunia hybrida line w mitchell large white flower produce pleasant fragrance by applying solid phase micro extraction spme technique coupled gc ms analysis volatile emission monitored vivo using targeted metabolomics approach mature flower released predominantly benzenoid compound benzaldehyde phenylacetaldehyde methylbenzoate phenylethylalcohol iso eugenol benzylbenzoate abundant this emission circadian rhythm reaching maximum dusk during petal limb expansion two sesquiterpenes emitted petunia flower tentatively identified germacrene d cadina diene in vitro analysis showed petal limb stigma main producer benzenoids sesquiterpenes respectively moreover comparison vivo vitro analysis indicated volatile stored period low emission rather synthesized de novo dna microarray analysis revealed gene pathway leading production volatile benzenoids upregulated late day preceding increase volatile emission rna gel blot analysis confirmed level phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal s adenosyl methionine sam synthase transcript increased towards evening our result suggest circadian production volatile benzenoids petunia w least partly regulated transcript level,low
449,Remodeling the isoprenoid pathway in tobacco by expressing the cytoplasmic mevalonate pathway in chloroplasts,"Abstract

Metabolic engineering to enhance production of isoprenoid metabolites for industrial and medical purposes is an important goal. The substrate for isoprenoid synthesis in plants is produced by the mevalonate pathway (MEV) in the cytosol and by the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids. A multi-gene approach was employed to insert the entire cytosolic MEV pathway into the tobacco chloroplast genome. Molecular analysis confirmed the site-specific insertion of seven transgenes and homoplasmy. Functionality was demonstrated by unimpeded growth on fosmidomycin, which specifically inhibits the MEP pathway. Transplastomic plants containing the MEV pathway genes accumulated higher levels of mevalonate, carotenoids, squalene, sterols, and triacyglycerols than control plants. This is the first time an entire eukaryotic pathway with six enzymes has been transplastomically expressed in plants. Thus, we have developed an important tool to redirect metabolic fluxes in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway and a viable multigene strategy for engineering metabolism in plants.",abstract metabolic engineering enhance production isoprenoid metabolite industrial medical purpose important goal the substrate isoprenoid synthesis plant produced mevalonate pathway mev cytosol c methyl erythritol phosphate mep pathway plastid a multi gene approach employed insert entire cytosolic mev pathway tobacco chloroplast genome molecular analysis confirmed site specific insertion seven transgene homoplasmy functionality demonstrated unimpeded growth fosmidomycin specifically inhibits mep pathway transplastomic plant containing mev pathway gene accumulated higher level mevalonate carotenoid squalene sterol triacyglycerols control plant this first time entire eukaryotic pathway six enzyme transplastomically expressed plant thus developed important tool redirect metabolic flux isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway viable multigene strategy engineering metabolism plant,high
450,Resin-based defenses in conifers,"Abstract

Bark beetle infestation and associated fungal infection are a serious disease problem in conifer species. Conifers have evolved elaborate, constitutive and inducible, terpene-based defense mechanisms to deter insect pests and their symbiotic fungal pathogens. This process involves the secretion of oleoresin, a complex mixture of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenoid acids. Induced oleoresinosis in grand fir (Abies grandis) provides a model system for studying the regulation of defensive terpene biosynthesis and for identifying relevant genes. The ecological relationships between conifers, beetle pests, beetle predators and fungal pathogens present several possible avenues for manipulating oleoresin composition to improve tree resistance. Possible examples include chemically disguising the host, adding toxins and altering the levels of pheromone precursors, attractants for predators or hormone mimics to disrupt insect development. Strategies and prospects for generating transgenic conifers with increased defense capability are discussed.",abstract bark beetle infestation associated fungal infection serious disease problem conifer specie conifers evolved elaborate constitutive inducible terpene based defense mechanism deter insect pest symbiotic fungal pathogen this process involves secretion oleoresin complex mixture monoterpenes sesquiterpenes diterpenoid acid induced oleoresinosis grand fir abies grandis provides model system studying regulation defensive terpene biosynthesis identifying relevant gene the ecological relationship conifer beetle pest beetle predator fungal pathogen present several possible avenue manipulating oleoresin composition improve tree resistance possible example include chemically disguising host adding toxin altering level pheromone precursor attractants predator hormone mimic disrupt insect development strategies prospect generating transgenic conifer increased defense capability discussed,low
451,"Rethinking of botanical volatile organic compounds applied in food preservation: Challenges in acquisition, application, microbial inhibition and stimulation","Abstract
Background

With the rising demand of microbiologically and chemically safe food products, conventional chemical preservatives are gradually fading away from the interests of both researchers and consumers. Thus, natural products are considered as promising substitution, especially botanical volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with bio-compatibility, accessibility and practicability, which are found versatile in defending both foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms.

Scope and approach

This article aims to comprehensively review the biosynthesis and antimicrobial mechanism of VOCs, collects and selects current and potential applications of VOCs in food pathogen control from both applied and basic research. Antimicrobial mechanisms of VOCs are divided into direct and indirect effects combined with summarization of potential VOCs candidates as antimicrobials. Biosynthesis and their rate-limited steps of VOCs in plants are systematically summarized in this review, furnishing a guideline for synthetic biology of VOC production. Challenges involving side-effects, microbial detoxification, toxicity, and acquisition of VOCs with possible solutions are elaborated.

Key findings and conclusions

Conceptual distinction is conducted between VOCs and essential oils (EOs), where synergetic and antagonistic effects of every single VOC component in EOs require more investigations. Synthetic biology enables large-scale production of VOCs instead of traditional extraction technique, however, detailed VOC biosynthesis pathway should be deciphered. Versatile applied platforms including modified atmosphere package, emulsion and coating are solutions for solving challenges impairing VOC practical application. Applied concentration and type of VOC directly influence on the safety and efficiency.

452,Structure and Dynamics of the Isoprenoid Pathway Network,"ABSTRACT

Isoprenoids are functionally and structurally the most diverse group of plant metabolites reported to date. They can function as primary metabolites, participating in essential plant cellular processes, and as secondary metabolites, of which many have substantial commercial, pharmacological, and agricultural value. Isoprenoid end products participate in plants in a wide range of physiological processes acting in them both synergistically, such as chlorophyll and carotenoids during photosynthesis, or antagonistically, such as gibberellic acid and abscisic acid during seed germination. It is therefore expected that fluxes via isoprenoid metabolic network are tightly controlled both temporally and spatially, and that this control occurs at different levels of regulation and in an orchestrated manner over the entire isoprenoid metabolic network. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the topology of the plant isoprenoid pathway network and its regulation at the gene expression level following diverse stimuli. We conclude by discussing agronomical and biotechnological applications emerging from the plant isoprenoid metabolism and provide an outlook on future directions in the systems analysis of the plant isoprenoid pathway network.",abstract isoprenoids functionally structurally diverse group plant metabolite reported date they function primary metabolite participating essential plant cellular process secondary metabolite many substantial commercial pharmacological agricultural value isoprenoid end product participate plant wide range physiological process acting synergistically chlorophyll carotenoid photosynthesis antagonistically gibberellic acid abscisic acid seed germination it therefore expected flux via isoprenoid metabolic network tightly controlled temporally spatially control occurs different level regulation orchestrated manner entire isoprenoid metabolic network in review summarize current knowledge topology plant isoprenoid pathway network regulation gene expression level following diverse stimulus we conclude discussing agronomical biotechnological application emerging plant isoprenoid metabolism provide outlook future direction system analysis plant isoprenoid pathway network,high
453,"Variation in the amino acids, volatile organic compounds and terpenes profiles in induced polyploids and in Solanum tuberosum varieties","Abstract

Polyploids often display a variety of phenotypic novelties when compared to their diploid progenitors, some of which may represent ecological advantages, especially regarding tolerance to biotic and abiotic factors. Plants cope with environmental factors by producing chemicals such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and specific amino acids (AAs). In potato, the third most important food crop in the world, gene introgression from diploid wild relative species into the genetic pool of the cultivated species (tetraploid) would be of great agronomical interest. The consequences of allopolyploidization on the potato VOCs and AAs profiles have not been yet analyzed. In this work, the effects of whole genome duplication on VOCs and AAs contents in leaves of potato allo- and autotetraploids and cultivated varieties were studied. The polyploids were obtained by chromosomal duplication of a genotype of the wild diploid species S. kurtzianum (autopolyploid model), and a diploid interspecific hybrid between the cultivated species S. tuberosum and S. kurtzianum (allopolyploid model). Almost all compounds levels varied greatly among these tetraploid lines; while all tetraploids showed higher contents of non-isoprenoids compounds than diploids, we found either increments or reductions in terpenes and AAs content. The results support the idea that genome duplication is a stochastic source of variability, which might be directly used for introgression in the 4x gene pool of the cultivated potato by sexual hybridization.",abstract polyploids often display variety phenotypic novelty compared diploid progenitor may represent ecological advantage especially regarding tolerance biotic abiotic factor plants cope environmental factor producing chemical volatile organic compound vocs specific amino acid aas in potato third important food crop world gene introgression diploid wild relative specie genetic pool cultivated specie tetraploid would great agronomical interest the consequence allopolyploidization potato vocs aas profile yet analyzed in work effect whole genome duplication vocs aas content leaf potato allo autotetraploids cultivated variety studied the polyploid obtained chromosomal duplication genotype wild diploid specie s kurtzianum autopolyploid model diploid interspecific hybrid cultivated specie s tuberosum s kurtzianum allopolyploid model almost compound level varied greatly among tetraploid line tetraploids showed higher content non isoprenoids compound diploid found either increment reduction terpene aas content the result support idea genome duplication stochastic source variability might directly used introgression x gene pool cultivated potato sexual hybridization,low
454,Volatile isoprenoids and their importance for protection against environmental constraints in the Mediterranean area,"Abstract

Among plant secondary metabolites, volatile isoprenoids have received increasing attention because they are involved in a range of physiological and ecological interactions, often helping plants cope with abiotic and biotic stressors, and potentially affecting the chemistry of the troposphere once they are emitted in the air. We review evidence about the beneficial functions of volatile isoprenoids in leaves, principally as antioxidants and membrane stabilizing agents, avoiding heat damage. Because the Mediterranean environment is characterized by prolonged dry and hot seasons, and recurrent heat-waves, we surmise that volatile isoprenoids are particularly widespread, and play an important physiological role, in Mediterranean woody plants. Based on a review of available inventories, isoprene emission characterizes deciduous woody plants, whereas evergreens are more often monoterpene emitters. Monoterpene emitters may be better fit to the Mediterranean climate, and, in general, to climate conditions favoring evergreens.",abstract among plant secondary metabolite volatile isoprenoids received increasing attention involved range physiological ecological interaction often helping plant cope abiotic biotic stressor potentially affecting chemistry troposphere emitted air we review evidence beneficial function volatile isoprenoids leaf principally antioxidant membrane stabilizing agent avoiding heat damage because mediterranean environment characterized prolonged dry hot season recurrent heat wave surmise volatile isoprenoids particularly widespread play important physiological role mediterranean woody plant based review available inventory isoprene emission characterizes deciduous woody plant whereas evergreen often monoterpene emitter monoterpene emitter may better fit mediterranean climate general climate condition favoring evergreen,low
455,Volatile organic compound emission and residual substances from plants in light of the globally increasing CO2 level,"Abstract

Global carbon dioxide emission in the atmosphere is increasing in the last years more than ever with values of 414 ppm in July 2020. For plants, more CO2 in the air is beneficial because the rate of photosynthetic carbon fixation is increasing, which determines more biomass production. An increase in CO2 brings with it climate change, which includes global warming and extreme phenomena. Such stress factors affect the development and metabolic pathways of plants. To counteract the effects of abiotic and biotic stresses, plants used different defense strategies, including volatile organic compounds emission. Plants are emitting different compounds such as terpenes, aromatic compounds, alcohols, and aldehydes. There are many papers which are dealing with the emission of volatile compounds from plants under abiotic and biotic stresses.

Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) elicited in response to herbivory can serve as cues for parasitic and predatory insects, but the modification of VOC elicitation responses under interacting abiotic stresses is poorly known. We studied foliage VOC emissions in the deciduous tree Alnus glutinosa induced by feeding by the larvae of green alder sawfly (Monsoma pulveratum) under well-watered and drought-stressed conditions. Drought strongly curbed photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance, but there were no effects of insect feeding on photosynthetic characteristics. Feeding induced emissions of volatile products of lipoxygenase pathway and monoterpenes, and emissions of stress marker compounds (E)-ß-ocimene and homoterpene DMNT. The emissions were more strongly elicited and reached a maximum value earlier in drought-stressed plants. In addition, methyl salicylate emissions were elicited in herbivory-fed drought-stressed plants. Herbivores were more strongly attracted to well-watered plants and consumed more than a four-fold greater fraction of leaf area than they consumed from drought-treated plants. Overall, this study demonstrates an important priming effect of drought, suggesting that plants under combined drought/herbivory stress are more resistant to herbivores.",abstract plant volatile organic compound vocs elicited response herbivory serve cue parasitic predatory insect modification voc elicitation response interacting abiotic stress poorly known we studied foliage voc emission deciduous tree alnus glutinosa induced feeding larva green alder sawfly monsoma pulveratum well watered drought stressed condition drought strongly curbed photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance effect insect feeding photosynthetic characteristic feeding induced emission volatile product lipoxygenase pathway monoterpenes emission stress marker compound e ocimene homoterpene dmnt the emission strongly elicited reached maximum value earlier drought stressed plant in addition methyl salicylate emission elicited herbivory fed drought stressed plant herbivores strongly attracted well watered plant consumed four fold greater fraction leaf area consumed drought treated plant overall study demonstrates important priming effect drought suggesting plant combined drought herbivory stress resistant herbivore,low

Background

Volatile aroma compounds are important characteristics determining essential oil quality. The heartwood of sandalwood tree, Santalum album L. deposits the sandalwood oil with enormous therapeutic potentials. The majority of the biological activities are attributed to the sesquiterpenoid alcohols i.e. santalols and hence, there is the need to explore the presence of other volatile bioactive constituents from heartwood.

Methods

We used a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method employing an ion trap quadrupole (ITQ) mass analyzer to identify and quantify volatiles from solvent extracted heartwood oil of the East Indian sandalwood tree, S. album L.

Results

A total of 46 constituents composed of a great variety of n-alkanes, sesquiterpenoids, fatty acids, aldehydes, naphthalene derivatives, methyl esters, alcohols, carotenoid degradation products, and acetates were identified. Oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, i.e., Z-a-santalol and epi-ß-santalol and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were identified as the major constituents in the extracted oil.

Conclusion

Results indicate that GC–ITQ–MS is a robust tool for qualitative and quantitative analysis of volatile constituents of the heartwood of sandalwood tree.

Here, we describe the state of the art in terpenoid metabolic engineering, showing that significant progress has been made over the past few years.

459,Yeast metabolic engineering – Targeting sterol metabolism and terpenoid formation,"Abstract

Terpenoids comprise various structures conferring versatile functions to eukaryotes, for example in the form of prenyl-anchors they attach proteins to membranes. The physiology of eukaryotic membranes is fine-tuned by another terpenoid class, namely sterols. Evidence is accumulating that numerous membrane proteins require specific sterol structural features for function. Moreover, sterols are intermediates in the synthesis of steroids serving as hormones in higher eukaryotes. Like steroids many compounds of the terpenoid family do not contribute to membrane architecture, but serve as signalling, protective or attractant/repellent molecules. Particularly plants have developed a plenitude of terpenoid biosynthetic routes branching off early in the sterol biosynthesis pathway and, thereby, forming one of the largest groups of naturally occurring organic compounds. Many of these aromatic and volatile molecules are interesting for industrial application ranging from foods to pharmaceuticals. Combining the fortunate situation that sterol biosynthesis is highly conserved in eukaryotes with the amenability of yeasts to genetic and metabolic engineering, basically all naturally occurring terpenoids might be produced involving yeasts. Such engineered yeasts are useful for the study of biological functions and molecular interactions of terpenoids as well as for the large-scale production of high-value compounds, which are unavailable in sufficient amounts from natural sources due to their low abundance.",abstract terpenoids comprise various structure conferring versatile function eukaryote example form prenyl anchor attach protein membrane the physiology eukaryotic membrane fine tuned another terpenoid class namely sterol evidence accumulating numerous membrane protein require specific sterol structural feature function moreover sterol intermediate synthesis steroid serving hormone higher eukaryote like steroid many compound terpenoid family contribute membrane architecture serve signalling protective attractant repellent molecule particularly plant developed plenitude terpenoid biosynthetic route branching early sterol biosynthesis pathway thereby forming one largest group naturally occurring organic compound many aromatic volatile molecule interesting industrial application ranging food pharmaceutical combining fortunate situation sterol biosynthesis highly conserved eukaryote amenability yeast genetic metabolic engineering basically naturally occurring terpenoids might produced involving yeast such engineered yeast useful study biological function molecular interaction terpenoids well large scale production high value compound unavailable sufficient amount natural source due low abundance,low
460,Centella asiatica: phytochemistry and mechanisms of neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement,"This review describes in detail the phytochemistry and neurological effects of the medicinal herb Centella asiatica (L.) Urban. C. asiatica is a small perennial plant that grows in moist, tropical and sub-tropical regions throughout the world. Phytochemicals identified from C. asiatica to date include isoprenoids (sesquiterpenes, plant sterols, pentacyclic triterpenoids and saponins) and phenylpropanoid derivatives (eugenol derivatives, caffeoylquinic acids, and flavonoids). Contemporary methods for fingerprinting and characterization of compounds in C. asiatica extracts include liquid chromatography and/or ion mobility spectrometry in conjunction with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Multiple studies in rodent models, and a limited number of human studies, support C. asiatica’s traditional reputation as a cognitive enhancer, as well as its anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects. Neuroprotective effects of C. asiatica are seen in several in vitro models, for example against beta amyloid toxicity, and appear to be associated with increased mitochondrial activity, improved antioxidant status, and/or inhibition of the pro-inflammatory enzyme, phospholipase A2. Neurotropic effects of C. asiatica include increased dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis, and may be due to modulations of signal transduction pathways such as ERK1/2 and Akt. Many of these neurotropic and neuroprotective properties of C. asiatica have been associated with the triterpene compounds asiatic acid, asiaticoside and madecassoside. More recently, caffeoylquinic acids are emerging as a second important group of active compounds in C. asiatica, with the potential of enhancing the Nrf2-antioxidant response pathway. The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the triterpenes, caffeoylquinic acids and flavonoids found in C. asiatica have been studied in humans and animal models, and the compounds or their metabolites found in the brain. This review highlights the remarkable potential for C. asiatica extracts and derivatives to be used in the treatment of neurological conditions, and considers the further research needed to actualize this possibility.",this review describes detail phytochemistry neurological effect medicinal herb centella asiatica l urban c asiatica small perennial plant grows moist tropical sub tropical region throughout world phytochemicals identified c asiatica date include isoprenoids sesquiterpenes plant sterol pentacyclic triterpenoids saponin phenylpropanoid derivative eugenol derivative caffeoylquinic acid flavonoid contemporary method fingerprinting characterization compound c asiatica extract include liquid chromatography ion mobility spectrometry conjunction high resolution mass spectrometry multiple study rodent model limited number human study support c asiatica traditional reputation cognitive enhancer well anxiolytic anticonvulsant effect neuroprotective effect c asiatica seen several vitro model example beta amyloid toxicity appear associated increased mitochondrial activity improved antioxidant status inhibition pro inflammatory enzyme phospholipase a neurotropic effect c asiatica include increased dendritic arborization synaptogenesis may due modulation signal transduction pathway erk akt many neurotropic neuroprotective property c asiatica associated triterpene compound asiatic acid asiaticoside madecassoside more recently caffeoylquinic acid emerging second important group active compound c asiatica potential enhancing nrf antioxidant response pathway the absorption distribution metabolism excretion triterpenes caffeoylquinic acid flavonoid found c asiatica studied human animal model compound metabolite found brain this review highlight remarkable potential c asiatica extract derivative used treatment neurological condition considers research needed actualize possibility,low
461,Thymus vulgaris L. (Thyme): In Vitro Culture and the Production of Secondary Metabolites,"
              Thymus is a perennial herb of the Labiatae family (Fig. 1A) and can grow to a height of some 30 cm. There are more than 100 varieties of Thymus distributed throughout Europe. It has dark green leaves and light mauve-pink flowers in early summer. Thyme is a good rock-garden plant, as it spreads easily. It originates on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and in the region of Asia Minor. Now it is cultivated in numerous European countries, Russia, Canada, America, and some of the North African countries. Thyme is one of the great culinary and medicinal herbs, and is a classic constituent of a bouquet garni (Fleming 1990), but only a few species are used in the kitchen, e.g., common thyme (T. vulgaris) and lemon thyme (T. citriodorus.) The essential oil (Marhuenda et al. 1988; Blazquez and Zafra-Polo 1989) of thyme has also been reported to be effective in food preservatives, antioxidants (Farag et al. 1990), antimicrobials (Morris et al. 1979), breath-freshen- ing dentifrices (Ishikawa and Shibuya 1989), medical disinfectants, etc. In general, the dried leaves contain 0.7–2.5% dry wt. of the essential oil. The major components are thymol (15–62%), carvacrol (2–44%), p-cymene, and ?-terpinene. The typical chemical structure is shown in Fig. 2.",thymus perennial herb labiatae family fig a grow height cm there variety thymus distributed throughout europe it dark green leaf light mauve pink flower early summer thyme good rock garden plant spread easily it originates coast mediterranean sea region asia minor now cultivated numerous european country russia canada america north african country thyme one great culinary medicinal herb classic constituent bouquet garni fleming specie used kitchen e g common thyme t vulgaris lemon thyme t citriodorus the essential oil marhuenda et al blazquez zafra polo thyme also reported effective food preservative antioxidant farag et al antimicrobial morris et al breath freshen ing dentifrice ishikawa shibuya medical disinfectant etc in general dried leaf contain dry wt essential oil the major component thymol carvacrol p cymene terpinene the typical chemical structure shown fig,low
462,A genomics resource for investigating regulation of essential oil production in Lavandula angustifolia,"We are developing Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) as a model system for investigating molecular regulation of essential oil (a mixture of mono- and sesquiterpenes) production in plants. As an initial step toward building the necessary ‘genomics toolbox’ for this species, we constructed two cDNA libraries from lavender leaves and flowers, and obtained sequence information for 14,213 high-quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Based on homology to sequences present in GenBank, our EST collection contains orthologs for genes involved in the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) and the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways of terpenoid biosynthesis, and for known terpene synthases and prenyl transferases. To gain insight into the regulation of terpene metabolism in lavender flowers, we evaluated the transcriptional activity of the genes encoding for 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), which represent regulatory steps of the DXP and MVA pathways, respectively, in glandular trichomes (oil glands) by real-time PCR. While HMGR transcripts were barely detectable, DXS was heavily expressed in this tissue, indicating that essential oil constituents are predominantly produced through the DXP pathway in lavender glandular trichomes. As anticipated, the linalool synthase (LinS)—the gene responsible for the production of linalool, a major constituent of lavender essential oil—was also strongly expressed in glands. Surprisingly, the most abundant transcript in floral glandular trichomes corresponded to a sesquiterpene synthase (cadinene synthase, CadS), although sesquiterpenes are minor constituents of lavender essential oils. This result, coupled to the weak activity of the MVA pathway (the main route for sesquiterpene production) in trichomes, indicates that precursor supply may represent a bottleneck in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes in lavender flowers.",we developing lavandula angustifolia lavender model system investigating molecular regulation essential oil mixture mono sesquiterpenes production plant as initial step toward building necessary genomics toolbox specie constructed two cdna library lavender leaf flower obtained sequence information high quality expressed sequence tag ests based homology sequence present genbank est collection contains orthologs gene involved deoxy d xylulose phosphate dxp mevalonic acid mva pathway terpenoid biosynthesis known terpene synthases prenyl transferase to gain insight regulation terpene metabolism lavender flower evaluated transcriptional activity gene encoding deoxy d xylulose phosphate synthase dxs hmg coa reductase hmgr represent regulatory step dxp mva pathway respectively glandular trichomes oil gland real time pcr while hmgr transcript barely detectable dxs heavily expressed tissue indicating essential oil constituent predominantly produced dxp pathway lavender glandular trichomes as anticipated linalool synthase lins gene responsible production linalool major constituent lavender essential oil also strongly expressed gland surprisingly abundant transcript floral glandular trichomes corresponded sesquiterpene synthase cadinene synthase cads although sesquiterpenes minor constituent lavender essential oil this result coupled weak activity mva pathway main route sesquiterpene production trichomes indicates precursor supply may represent bottleneck biosynthesis sesquiterpenes lavender flower,low
463,"Abscisic Acid and Fruit Ripening: Its Role in Grapevine Acclimation to the Environment, a Case of Study","The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is a sesquiterpene (C15) produced not only in plants, but also by algae, fungi and bacteria. In higher plants, ABA is produced in plastids via the methyl erythritol phosphate that leads to carotene biosynthesis. ABA levels in plant tissues are regulated by biosynthesis, catabolism and reversible conjugation with glucose. Cell site of ABA synthesis is associated with its role in the control of stomata movement. ABA alleviates plant tissues from water stress by inducing stomata closure that hampers water restriction, although CO2 diffusion is also lessened and therefore photosynthesis limited. However, ABA is also critical for growth and yield under non-stressful conditions, and even it promotes growth and cropping under stressful situations and in different species by improving water use efficiency and dry matter accumulation. In fruits ABA participates in their growth, development and ripening, interplaying with other phytohormones and regulating a complex network of transcriptional factors. The control by ABA of grape berry ripening and its role in grapevines acclimation to solar ultraviolet-B and moderate water restriction is analyzed as a case of study. The results obtained involve crop increases as a result of fruit set stimulation, along with modulation in carbohydrate transport, enhancement of membrane stability via sterol biosynthesis, increase of antioxidant enzymes, and promotion of phloem tissue. ABA also induces production of metabolites with antioxidant properties, like phenolic and volatile organic compounds, in berry skins, so anticipating berry ripening and improving the fruit characteristics for high-quality winemaking.",the phytohormone abscisic acid aba sesquiterpene c produced plant also algae fungi bacteria in higher plant aba produced plastid via methyl erythritol phosphate lead carotene biosynthesis aba level plant tissue regulated biosynthesis catabolism reversible conjugation glucose cell site aba synthesis associated role control stoma movement aba alleviates plant tissue water stress inducing stoma closure hamper water restriction although co diffusion also lessened therefore photosynthesis limited however aba also critical growth yield non stressful condition even promotes growth cropping stressful situation different specie improving water use efficiency dry matter accumulation in fruit aba participates growth development ripening interplaying phytohormone regulating complex network transcriptional factor the control aba grape berry ripening role grapevine acclimation solar ultraviolet b moderate water restriction analyzed case study the result obtained involve crop increase result fruit set stimulation along modulation carbohydrate transport enhancement membrane stability via sterol biosynthesis increase antioxidant enzyme promotion phloem tissue aba also induces production metabolite antioxidant property like phenolic volatile organic compound berry skin anticipating berry ripening improving fruit characteristic high quality winemaking,low
464,An IDS-Type Sesquiterpene Synthase Produces the Pheromone Precursor (Z)-a-Bisabolene in Nezara viridula,"Insects use a wide range of structurally diverse pheromones for intra-specific communication. Compounds in the class of terpenes are emitted as sex, aggregation, alarm, or trail pheromones. Despite the common occurrence of terpene pheromones in different insect lineages, their origin from dietary host plant precursors or de novo biosynthetic pathways often remains unknown. Several stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) release bisabolene-type sesquiterpenes for aggregation and mating. Here we provide evidence for de novo biosynthesis of the sex pheromone trans-/cis-(Z)-a-bisabolene epoxide of the Southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula. We show that an enzyme (NvTPS) related to isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs) of the core terpene metabolic pathway functions as a terpene synthase (TPS), which converts the general intermediate (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to the putative pheromone precursor (+)-(S,Z)-a-bisabolene in vitro and in protein lysates. A second identified IDS-type protein (NvFPPS) makes the TPS substrate (E,E)-FPP and functions as a bona fide FPP synthase. NvTPS is highly expressed in male epidermal tissue associated with the cuticle of ventral sternites, which is in agreement with the male specific release of the pheromone from glandular cells in this tissue. Our study supports findings of the function of similar TPS enzymes in the biosynthesis of aggregation pheromones from the pine engraver beetle Ips pini, the striped flea beetle Phyllotreta striolata, and the harlequin bug Murgantia histrionica, and hence provides growing evidence for the evolution of terpene de novo biosynthesis by IDS-type TPS families in insects.",insects use wide range structurally diverse pheromone intra specific communication compounds class terpene emitted sex aggregation alarm trail pheromone despite common occurrence terpene pheromone different insect lineage origin dietary host plant precursor de novo biosynthetic pathway often remains unknown several stink bug hemiptera pentatomidae release bisabolene type sesquiterpenes aggregation mating here provide evidence de novo biosynthesis sex pheromone trans ci z bisabolene epoxide southern green stink bug nezara viridula we show enzyme nvtps related isoprenyl diphosphate synthases idss core terpene metabolic pathway function terpene synthase tps convert general intermediate e e farnesyl diphosphate fpp putative pheromone precursor s z bisabolene vitro protein lysates a second identified ids type protein nvfpps make tps substrate e e fpp function bona fide fpp synthase nvtps highly expressed male epidermal tissue associated cuticle ventral sternites agreement male specific release pheromone glandular cell tissue our study support finding function similar tps enzyme biosynthesis aggregation pheromone pine engraver beetle ips pini striped flea beetle phyllotreta striolata harlequin bug murgantia histrionica hence provides growing evidence evolution terpene de novo biosynthesis ids type tps family insect,medium

466,Anemia tomentosa var. anthriscifolia in vitro culture: sporophyte development and volatile compound profile of an aromatic fern,"Anemia tomentosa var. anthriscifolia is an aromatic fern with a pleasant woody aroma and antimycobacterial activity. In this paper, we describe for the first time its spore-derived gametophyte development and the effect of indole-3-acetic acid and jasmonic acid on in vitro gametophyte/sporophyte development, as well as volatile compound production. Volatiles were obtained by simultaneous distillation and extraction (SDE) and analyzed by high resolution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Spore-derived gametophytes were able to develop into sporophytes independently of the media culture composition, even when no plant growth regulator was added. Fifty different substances were detected in all in vitro A. tomentosa SDE extracts, while 20 were detected in the wild SDE plant extract. Monoterpenes were more prevalent (69.8–89.8%) than sesquiterpenes (9.4–28.7%) in in vitro plants, while sesquiterpenes represent 97.5% of the volatiles produced by the wild-grown plants. The major monoterpene components in in vitro plants were a-pinene (9.3–24.3%), trans-pinocarveol (20.6–27.9%), pinocarvone (15.4–25.1%) and myrtenyl acetate (6.4–12.3%).

The changes in the monoterpene/sesquiterpene rates between micropropagated and wild plants are not related to the presence of JA or IAA in the media culture. Further studies are still needed to obtain a complete understanding of the factors leading to these results, which could be related to differences in the irradiance levels of in vitro plants versus those from a wild environment, as well as the developmental stage of the plants.

467,Apocarotenoids: A New Carotenoid-Derived Pathway,"Carotenoids are precursors of carotenoid derived molecules termed apocarotenoids, which include isoprenoids with important functions in plant-environment interactions such as the attraction of pollinators and the defense against pathogens and herbivores. Apocarotenoids also include volatile aromatic compounds that act as repellents, chemoattractants, growth simulators and inhibitors, as well as the phytohormones abscisic acid and strigolactones. In plants, apocarotenoids can be found in several types of plastids (etioplast, leucoplast and chromoplast) and among different plant tissues such as flowers and roots. The structural similarity of some flower and spice isoprenoid volatile organic compounds (ß-ionone and safranal) to carotenoids has led to the recent discovery of carotenoid-specific cleavage oxygenases, including carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases and 9-cis-epoxydioxygenases, which tailor and transform carotenoids into apocarotenoids. The great diversity of apocarotenoids is a consequence of the huge amount of carotenoid precursors, the variations in specific cleavage sites and the modifications after cleavage. Lycopene, ß-carotene and zeaxanthin are the precursors of the main apocarotenoids described to date, which include bixin, crocin, picrocrocin, abscisic acid, strigolactone and mycorradicin.",carotenoids precursor carotenoid derived molecule termed apocarotenoids include isoprenoids important function plant environment interaction attraction pollinator defense pathogen herbivore apocarotenoids also include volatile aromatic compound act repellent chemoattractants growth simulator inhibitor well phytohormone abscisic acid strigolactones in plant apocarotenoids found several type plastid etioplast leucoplast chromoplast among different plant tissue flower root the structural similarity flower spice isoprenoid volatile organic compound ionone safranal carotenoid led recent discovery carotenoid specific cleavage oxygenase including carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases ci epoxydioxygenases tailor transform carotenoid apocarotenoids the great diversity apocarotenoids consequence huge amount carotenoid precursor variation specific cleavage site modification cleavage lycopene carotene zeaxanthin precursor main apocarotenoids described date include bixin crocin picrocrocin abscisic acid strigolactone mycorradicin,low
468,"Apocarotenoids: hormones, mycorrhizal metabolites and aroma volatiles","Apocarotenoids are tailored from carotenoids by oxidative enzymes [carotenoid cleavage oxygenases (CCOs)], cleaving specific double bonds of the polyene chain. The cleavage products can act as hormones, signaling compounds, chromophores and scent/aroma constituents. Recent advances were the identification of strigolactones as apocarotenoids and the description of their novel role as shoot branching inhibitor hormones. Strigolactones are also involved in plant signaling to both harmful (parasitic weeds) and beneficial [arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi] rhizosphere residents. This review describes the progress in the characterization of CCOs, termed CCDs and NCEDs, in plants. It highlights the importance of sequential cleavage reactions of C40 carotenoid precursors, the apocarotenoid cleavage oxygenase (ACO) nature of several CCOs and the topic of compartmentation. Work on the biosynthesis of abundant C13 cyclohexenone and C14 mycorradicin apocarotenoids in mycorrhizal roots has revealed a new role of CCD1 as an ACO of C27 apocarotenoid intermediates, following their predicted export from plastid to cytosol. Manipulation of the AM-induced apocarotenoid pathway further suggests novel roles of C13 apocarotenoids in controlling arbuscule turnover in the AM symbiosis. CCD7 has been established as a biosynthetic crosspoint, controlling both strigolactone and AM-induced C13 apocarotenoid biosynthesis. Interdependence of the two apocarotenoid pathways may thus play a role in AM-mediated reduction of parasitic weed infestations. Potential scenarios of C13 scent/aroma volatile biogenesis are discussed, including the novel mechanism revealed from mycorrhizal roots.

These compounds are often perceived by humans as a specific fruit or vegetable aroma. Many of these volatiles serve also as defense substances against fungi, bacteria, viruses, and herbivores. The knowledge of precursors and pathways leading to the formation of volatiles in fruits and vegetables has considerably progressed during the last years because of the use of molecular and biochemical techniques. In vitro characterization of the heterologously expressed enzymes has helped clarify the pathways of volatile formation. This chapter will, therefore, provide an overview of biosynthetic sequences and construction mechanisms that are illustrated in most cases using detailed reaction schemes. The various compounds are predominantly ordered according to the biosynthetic pathway that is used in plants to synthesize them and are grouped into carbohydrate-, lipid-, and amino-acid-derived odorants, terpenoids, and glycosidically bound odorants.",plants produce thousand structurally diverse volatile signal compound attract pollinating insect seed dispersing animal these compound often perceived human specific fruit vegetable aroma many volatile serve also defense substance fungi bacteria virus herbivore the knowledge precursor pathway leading formation volatile fruit vegetable considerably progressed last year use molecular biochemical technique in vitro characterization heterologously expressed enzyme helped clarify pathway volatile formation this chapter therefore provide overview biosynthetic sequence construction mechanism illustrated case using detailed reaction scheme the various compound predominantly ordered according biosynthetic pathway used plant synthesize grouped carbohydrate lipid amino acid derived odorants terpenoids glycosidically bound odorants,medium
479,Biosynthesis of Sesquiterpene Lactones in Plants and Metabolic Engineering for Their Biotechnological Production,"In the present chapter, we review some aspects of the biosynthesis of sesquiterpene lactones and its regulation in different medicinal and aromatic plants used in the pharmaceutical industry. In this sense, we describe the mevalonate and the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathways, which generate the corresponding isoprenoid precursors (isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate), as well as the late pathways that lead to sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis. This chapter also analyses the role of the transcription factors involved in the regulation of sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis and the different biotechnological approaches that have been developed for sesquiterpene lactone production. In vitro plant cell cultures (comprising micropropagation and plant cell suspension, shoot and root cultures) have emerged as a production platform for many plant secondary metabolites, since they allow their production under controlled conditions and shorter production cycles. The characterisation and isolation of genes involved in the regulation of sesquiterpene lactone biosynthetic pathways have allowed the design of metabolic engineering strategies to increase the production of these metabolites. Moreover, we discuss different strategies to increase sesquiterpene lactone production through genetic engineering. We also focus on the metabolic engineering of the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway in Artemisia annua. This metabolic pathway has become a model system not only for the biotechnological production of sesquiterpene lactones but also for the improvement of other plant secondary metabolic pathways. Finally, we analyse the successful expression of the complete artemisinin biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has led to the efficient accumulation of artemisinic acid in these microorganisms.",in present chapter review aspect biosynthesis sesquiterpene lactones regulation different medicinal aromatic plant used pharmaceutical industry in sense describe mevalonate c methyl d erythritol phosphate pathway generate corresponding isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate dimethylallyl diphosphate well late pathway lead sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis this chapter also analysis role transcription factor involved regulation sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis different biotechnological approach developed sesquiterpene lactone production in vitro plant cell culture comprising micropropagation plant cell suspension shoot root culture emerged production platform many plant secondary metabolite since allow production controlled condition shorter production cycle the characterisation isolation gene involved regulation sesquiterpene lactone biosynthetic pathway allowed design metabolic engineering strategy increase production metabolite moreover discus different strategy increase sesquiterpene lactone production genetic engineering we also focus metabolic engineering artemisinin biosynthetic pathway artemisia annua this metabolic pathway become model system biotechnological production sesquiterpene lactones also improvement plant secondary metabolic pathway finally analyse successful expression complete artemisinin biosynthetic pathway escherichia coli saccharomyces cerevisiae led efficient accumulation artemisinic acid microorganism,high
480,Biosynthesis of Terpenoid Natural Products in Fungi,"Tens of thousands of terpenoid natural products have been isolated from plants and microbial sources. Higher fungi (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) are known to produce an array of well-known terpenoid natural products, including mycotoxins, antibiotics, antitumor compounds, and phytohormones. Except for a few well-studied fungal biosynthetic pathways, the majority of genes and biosynthetic pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of a small number of these secondary metabolites have only been discovered and characterized in the past 5–10 years. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on fungal terpenoid biosynthesis from biochemical, genetic, and genomic viewpoints. Enzymes involved in synthesizing, transferring, and cyclizing the prenyl chains that form the hydrocarbon scaffolds of fungal terpenoid natural products are systematically discussed. Genomic information and functional evidence suggest differences between the terpenome of the two major fungal phyla—the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota—which will be illustrated for each group of terpenoid natural products.",tens thousand terpenoid natural product isolated plant microbial source higher fungi ascomycota basidiomycota known produce array well known terpenoid natural product including mycotoxin antibiotic antitumor compound phytohormone except well studied fungal biosynthetic pathway majority gene biosynthetic pathway responsible biosynthesis small number secondary metabolite discovered characterized past year this chapter provides comprehensive overview current knowledge fungal terpenoid biosynthesis biochemical genetic genomic viewpoint enzymes involved synthesizing transferring cyclizing prenyl chain form hydrocarbon scaffold fungal terpenoid natural product systematically discussed genomic information functional evidence suggest difference terpenome two major fungal phylum ascomycota basidiomycota illustrated group terpenoid natural product,low
481,"Biosynthesis, accumulation and emission of carotenoids, a-tocopherol, plastoquinone, and isoprene in leaves under high photosynthetic irradiance","The localization of isoprenoid lipids in chloroplasts, the accumulation of particular isoprenoids under high irradiance conditions, and channelling of photosynthetically fixed carbon into plastidic thylakoid isoprenoids, volatile isoprenoids, and cytosolic sterols are reviewed. During leaf and chloroplast development in spring plastidic isoprenoid biosynthesis provides primarily thylakoid carotenoids, the phytyl side-chain of chlorophylls and the electron carriers phylloquinone K1, a-tocoquinone and a-tocopherol, as well as the nona-prenyl side-chain of plastoquinone-9. Under high irradiance, plants develop sun leaves and high light (HL) leaves with sun-type chloroplasts that possess, besides higher photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rates, different quantitative levels of pigments and prenylquinones as compared to shade leaves and low light (LL) leaves. After completion of chloroplast thylakoid synthesis plastidic isoprenoid biosynthesis continues at high irradiance conditions, constantly accumulating a-tocopherol (a-T) and the reduced form of plastoquinone-9 (PQ-9H2) deposited in the steadily enlarging osmiophilic plastoglobuli, the lipid reservoir of the chloroplast stroma. In sun leaves of beech (Fagus) and in 3-year-old sunlit Ficus leaves the level of a-T and PQ-9 can exceed that of chlorophyll b. Most plants respond to HL conditions (sun leaves, leaves suddenly lit by the sun) with a 1.4–2-fold increase of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids (violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin), an enhanced operation of the xanthophyll cycle and an increase of ß-carotene levels. This is documented by significantly lower values for the weight ratio chlorophylls to carotenoids (range: 3.6–4.6) as compared to shade and LL leaves (range: 4.8–7.0). Many plant leaves emit under HL and high temperature conditions at high rates the volatile compounds isoprene (broadleaf trees) or methylbutenol (American ponderosa pines), both of which are formed via the plastidic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-phosphate/2-C-methylerythritol 5-phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathway. Other plants by contrast, accumulate particular mono- and diterpenes. Under adequate photosynthetic conditions the chloroplastidic DOXP/MEP isoprenoid pathway essentially contributes, with its C5 isoprenoid precusors, to cytosolic sterol biosynthesis.

Limonene is applied in relatively highly priced products, such as fragrances, and also has applications with lower value but large production volume, such as biomaterials. Limonene is currently produced as a side product from the citrus juice industry, but the availability and quality are fluctuating and may be insufficient for novel bulk applications. Therefore, complementary microbial production of limonene would be interesting. Since limonene can be derivatized to high-value compounds, microbial platforms also have a great potential beyond just producing limonene. In this review, we discuss the ins and outs of microbial limonene production in comparison with plant-based and chemical production. Achievements and specific challenges for microbial production of limonene are discussed, especially in the light of bulk applications such as biomaterials.",this mini review describes novel biotechnology based way producing monoterpene limonene limonene applied relatively highly priced product fragrance also application lower value large production volume biomaterials limonene currently produced side product citrus juice industry availability quality fluctuating may insufficient novel bulk application therefore complementary microbial production limonene would interesting since limonene derivatized high value compound microbial platform also great potential beyond producing limonene in review discus in out microbial limonene production comparison plant based chemical production achievements specific challenge microbial production limonene discussed especially light bulk application biomaterials,low
484,Calling in the Dark: The Role of Volatiles for Communication in the Rhizosphere,"Volatile organic compounds play an important role in the communication between plants and other organisms. The rhizosphere contains a large and diverse microbial community whose members use similar volatiles for intra- and interspecific communication. However, the analysis of volatiles produced in the rhizosphere and their ecological functions have been little explored so far. In this chapter, we outline what is known about the classes of volatiles that are emitted into the rhizosphere by roots and soil microbes, and the effect they have on different interactors in the soil. Additionally, we review current approaches to sample volatiles in mesocosms and field soils. We conclude that to better understand the production and functions of volatiles in the rhizosphere, it is of critical importance to design set-ups that account for the natural complexity of soils. This will help to apply this knowledge for sustainable agriculture and the identification of novel agrochemicals.",volatile organic compound play important role communication plant organism the rhizosphere contains large diverse microbial community whose member use similar volatile intra interspecific communication however analysis volatile produced rhizosphere ecological function little explored far in chapter outline known class volatile emitted rhizosphere root soil microbe effect different interactors soil additionally review current approach sample volatile mesocosms field soil we conclude better understand production function volatile rhizosphere critical importance design set ups account natural complexity soil this help apply knowledge sustainable agriculture identification novel agrochemicals,medium

486,Chapter 10 The Role of the Methyl-Erythritol-Phosphate (MEP)Pathway in Rhythmic Emission of Volatiles,"Plants release an array of terpenoid compounds including hemiterpenes, mono- and sesquiterpenes, irregular terpenes and some diterpenes throughout their life cycles. These secondary metabolites play crucial roles in pollinator attraction, defense, communication and interaction with the surrounding environment. Release of these compounds from flowers and undamaged and herbivore attacked leaves follows a rhythmic profile, which is induced by illumination and often controlled by a circadian clock. In plants two distinct biochemical pathways localized in different subcellular compartments, the cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and plastidial methyl-erythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway, are responsible for the biosynthesis of basic carbon building blocks for terpenoid compounds. Mounting evidence suggests that the flux through the MEP pathway changes rhythmically over a daily light/dark cycle peaking during the day. In this chapter we discuss the contribution of the MEP pathway to the rhythmic emission of terpenoids released from different plant tissues and the regulatory steps controlling the flux through this pathway.",plants release array terpenoid compound including hemiterpenes mono sesquiterpenes irregular terpene diterpenes throughout life cycle these secondary metabolite play crucial role pollinator attraction defense communication interaction surrounding environment release compound flower undamaged herbivore attacked leaf follows rhythmic profile induced illumination often controlled circadian clock in plant two distinct biochemical pathway localized different subcellular compartment cytosolic mevalonic acid mva pathway plastidial methyl erythritol phosphate mep pathway responsible biosynthesis basic carbon building block terpenoid compound mounting evidence suggests flux mep pathway change rhythmically daily light dark cycle peaking day in chapter discus contribution mep pathway rhythmic emission terpenoids released different plant tissue regulatory step controlling flux pathway,low
487,Chapter 7 The Non-mevalonate DOXP/MEP (Deoxyxylulose 5-Phosphate/Methylerythritol 4-Phosphate) Pathway of Chloroplast Isoprenoid and Pigment Biosynthesis,"The plastidic pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and isoprenoid biosynthesis, the DOXP/MEP pathway, possesses an essential function in the biosynthesis of thylakoidal prenylllipids chlorophylls (phytyl side-chain), carotenoids, plastoquinone-9, phylloquinone K1 and a-tocopherol, as well as for monoterpenes and diterpenes. Here we review its detection, its enzymes, intermediates, genes, cofactor requirements and inhibitors. This plastidic isoprenoid pathway is also contrasted against the acetate/mevalonate(MVA) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis operating in the cytosol for the biosynthesis of sterols, sesquiterpenes and polyterpenes. The DOXP/MEP pathway can specifically be inhibited by fosmidomycin and the acetate/MVA pathway by statins (e.g. mevinolin). By applying specifically marked substrates (2H-deoxyxylulose, 14C-DOXP, 3H-MVA or 14C-MVA) and specific inhibitors a cross-talk between both IPP yielding cell pathways was detected that operates preferentially in the chloroplast-to-cytosol direction. The DOXP/MEP pathway is also involved in the biosynthesis of the volatile hemiterpenes isoprene and methylbutenol. The distribution of the DOXP/MEP pathway in photosynthetic organisms (bacteria, algae, higher plants) and its putative origin in anoxigenic photosynthetic bacteria is reviewed. The DOXP/MEP pathway does not occur in Archaea, fungi or animals.

Some plastidial isoprenoids are also relevant for their biotechnological interest. The recently elucidated methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway provides the isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate required for the synthesis of plastidial isoprenoids. At present, very little is known about the regulatory mechanisms underlying the control of the metabolic flux through the MEP pathway and its crosstalk with the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway.

FJ459894), and a DXS gene, AvDXS (GenBank accession no. FJ455512), were isolated from the leaves of Amomum villosum, one of the most well-known and authentic herbs in South China. The 1,749-bp full-length cDNA of AvDXR encoded a peptide of 472 amino acids, and the 2,347-bp full-length cDNA of AvDXS encoded a peptide of 715 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequences of the AvDXR and AvDXS proteins share high homology with DXRs and DXSs from other plant species, and AvDXS belongs to class 1 plant DXS. The characterization based on bioinformatic analysis indicated that the AvDXR and AvDXS encoded functional proteins as DXR and DXS, respectively. The functional color assay in Escherichia coli with pAC-BETA implied that AvDXR and AvDXS encoded functional proteins that manipulated the biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors. Both AvDXR and AvDXS were expressed extensively in the leaves, stems, roots, pericarps and seeds of A. villosum. AvDXS expression was similar in all tissues investigated, whereas higher levels of AvDXR were observed in the fruits, the main part for the accumulation of volatile oil in this plant. AvDXR was transformed into tobacco to confirm its function further. Overexpression of AvDXR in transgenic T1 generation tobacco increased DXR activity, photosynthetic pigment content and volatile isoprenoid components, and the increase of photosynthetic pigment content was consistent with the AvDXR transcription level.

We isolated a cDNA that codes for a sesquiterpene synthase from young rhizomes of ginger, Z. officinale Roscoe, Japanese cultivar “Kintoki”. The cDNA, designated ZoTps1, potentially encoded a protein that comprised 550 amino acid residues and exhibited 49–53% identity with those of the sesquiterpene synthases already isolated from the genus Zingiber. Recombinant Escherichia coli cells, in which ZoTps1 was coexpressed along with genes for D-mevalonate utilization, resulted in the production of a sesquiterpene (S)-ß-bisabolene exclusively with a D-mevalonolactone supplement. This result indicated that ZoTps1 was the (S)-ß-bisabolene synthase gene in ginger. ZoTPS1 was suggested to catalyze (S)-ß-bisabolene formation with the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate to nerolidyl diphosphate followed by the cyclization between position 1 and 6 carbons.

Terpenoids are one of the most important sources of plant secondary metabolites with many functions such as attracting pollinators, defending against herbivores, and acting as anti-bacterial agents. Here, the terpene synthases (TPSs) that produce small and volatile monoterpenes or sesquiterpenes were focused. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, we obtained nine full-length cDNAs from P. campanulata which were predicted to encode TPSs. The predicted proteins possessed typical characteristics of TPSs, such as the highly conserved RRX8W and DDXXD motifs. To identify the functions of these TPSs, the recombinant proteins were reacted with the substrate to produce corresponding monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Analysis results revealed that the eight TPSs produced their corresponding major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, except for one TPS gene that lacks a part of the N-terminus sequence.

In silico metabolic pathways have been reconstructed using a wide range of computational methods. The reconstructed metabolic pathways can vary in some aspects, among which, in the context of this work, it is relevant to remark the data structure and granularity of biochemical details. Inferring chemical reactions using graph grammar rules is a method that exposes the initial, intermediates, and final products by modeling pathways over graphs and hypergraphs. Plant monoterpenes are volatile compounds with applications in industry, biotechnology, and medicine. They also play a vital ecological role. The last enzymatic reaction in the plant monoterpenes production chain is plentiful of possibilities due to the promiscuous nature of the terpene synthases (TPS), a case in which the application of inferring chemical reactions using graph grammar rules is suitable. In this work, we designed graph grammar rules that express cyclization reactions catalyzed by plant monoterpene synthases. As a result, it was generated a reachable chemical space of potential plant monoterpene blend, which can be computationally exploitable.

495,Involvement of Compartmentalization in Monoterpene and Sesquiterpene Biosynthesis in Plants,"Terpenoids play numerous vital roles in basic plant processes with volatile monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes contributing to plant defense and reproduction. The biosynthesis of terpenoids in plants occurs in different subcellular compartments, which until recently were believed to include the cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria.

496,Isopentenyl Diphosphate Isomerase (IPI) Gene Silencing Negatively Affects Patchouli Alcohol Biosynthesis in Pogostemon cablin,"Pogostemon cablin is a medicinally and economically important plant because it contains a high content of patchouli oil. Patchouli oil is composed of more than 24 unique sesquiterpene compounds, with the most abundant being patchouli alcohol (PA). PA is a sesquiterpene and is mainly synthesized through the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in plants in which isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPI) is a key enzyme. Here, a full-length cDNA encoding IPI (designated as PcIPI) was cloned from P. cablin through the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the full-length PcIPI includes an 879 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 292 amino acid protein with a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.55 and a molecular mass of 32.8 kDa. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that PcIPI shared the most recent genetic relationship with the IPI of Isodon rubescens (86.43%), Salvia miltiorrhiza (85.38%), Plectranthus barbatus (86.54%), and Prunella vulgaris (86.31%). To verify the function of the PcIPI gene in PA biosynthesis, the P. cablin plants were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens bearing a pTRV2-PcIPI construct to induce virus-mediated PcIPI silencing. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis were applied to detect changes in the PcIPI catalytic products and transcription levels. The trend of decreasing transcript level was found to be similar to that of decreasing sesquiterpene content.

497,"Isoprenoid Drugs, Biofuels, and Chemicals—Artemisinin, Farnesene, and Beyond","Isoprenoids have been identified and used as natural pharmaceuticals, fragrances, solvents, and, more recently, advanced biofuels. Although isoprenoids are most commonly found in plants, researchers have successfully engineered both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways to produce these valuable chemicals in microorganisms at high yields. The microbial synthesis of the precursor to artemisinin—an important antimalarial drug produced from the sweet wormwood Artemisia annua—serves as perhaps the most successful example of this approach. Through advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, microbial-derived semisynthetic artemisinin may soon replace plant-derived artemisinin as the primary source of this valuable pharmaceutical. The richness and diversity of isoprenoid structures also make them ideal candidates for advanced biofuels that may act as “drop-in” replacements for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Indeed, the sesquiterpenes farnesene and bisabolene, monoterpenes pinene and limonene, and hemiterpenes isopentenol and isopentanol have been evaluated as fuels or fuel precursors. As in the artemisinin project, these isoprenoids have been produced microbially through synthetic biology and metabolic engineering efforts. Here, we provide a brief review of the numerous isoprenoid compounds that have found use as pharmaceuticals, flavors, commodity chemicals, and, most importantly, advanced biofuels. In each case, we highlight the metabolic engineering strategies that were used to produce these compounds successfully in microbial hosts. In addition, we present a current outlook on microbial isoprenoid production, with an eye towards the many challenges that must be addressed to achieve higher yields and industrial-scale production.

498,"Isoprenoid Production via Plant Cell Cultures: Biosynthesis, Accumulation and Scaling-Up to Bioreactors","Plant cell culture is traditionally viewed as a unique artificially created biological system representing a heterogenous population of dedifferentiated cells. This system undergoes a continuous process of autoselection based on the intensity and stability of cell proliferation. We discuss here the details of formation and regulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis in plant cell in vitro based on literature survey and our research. Obviously, secondary metabolism differs in cell culture compared to the plant per se, because in cell culture metabolites are synthesized and compartmentalized within a single heterotrophic cell with sparse or underdeveloped vacuoles and plastids. For example, in plant cell cultures isoprenoid biosynthesis via MVA pathway was found to be more active than via plastid-localized MEP pathway. Also, it was hypothesized that cell cultures preferably produce metabolites, which promote cell proliferation and growth. Indeed, cell cultures of Dioscorea deltoidea produced mainly furostanol glycosides, which promoted cell division. Triterpene glycosides (ginsenosides) in the cell cultures of various Panax species are represented mainly by Rg- and Rb-groups. Rb ginsenosides are predominantly found as malonyl-esters that may influence their intracellular localization.",plant cell culture traditionally viewed unique artificially created biological system representing heterogenous population dedifferentiated cell this system undergoes continuous process autoselection based intensity stability cell proliferation we discus detail formation regulation isoprenoid biosynthesis plant cell vitro based literature survey research obviously secondary metabolism differs cell culture compared plant per se cell culture metabolite synthesized compartmentalized within single heterotrophic cell sparse underdeveloped vacuole plastid for example plant cell culture isoprenoid biosynthesis via mva pathway found active via plastid localized mep pathway also hypothesized cell culture preferably produce metabolite promote cell proliferation growth indeed cell culture dioscorea deltoidea produced mainly furostanol glycoside promoted cell division triterpene glycoside ginsenosides cell culture various panax specie represented mainly rg rb group rb ginsenosides predominantly found malonyl ester may influence intracellular localization,low

500,Leaf isoprene emission as a trait that mediates the growth-defense tradeoff in the face of climate stress,"Plant isoprene emissions are known to contribute to abiotic stress tolerance, especially during episodes of high temperature and drought, and during cellular oxidative stress. Recent studies have shown that genetic transformations to add or remove isoprene emissions cause a cascade of cellular modifications that include known signaling pathways, and interact to remodel adaptive growth-defense tradeoffs. The most compelling evidence for isoprene signaling is found in the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways, which produce salicylic acid, alkaloids, tannins, anthocyanins, flavonols and other flavonoids; all of which have roles in stress tolerance and plant defense. Isoprene also influences key gene expression patterns in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, and the jasmonic acid, gibberellic acid and cytokinin signaling networks that have important roles in controlling inducible defense responses and influencing plant growth and development, particularly following defoliation. In this synthesis paper, using past studies of transgenic poplar, tobacco and Arabidopsis, we present the evidence for isoprene acting as a metabolite that coordinates aspects of cellular signaling, resulting in enhanced chemical defense during periods of climate stress, while minimizing costs to growth. This perspective represents a major shift in our thinking away from direct effects of isoprene, for example, by changing membrane properties or quenching ROS, to indirect effects, through changes in gene expression and protein abundances. Recognition of isoprene's role in the growth-defense tradeoff provides new perspectives on evolution of the trait, its contribution to plant adaptation and resilience, and the ecological niches in which it is most effective.",plant isoprene emission known contribute abiotic stress tolerance especially episode high temperature drought cellular oxidative stress recent study shown genetic transformation add remove isoprene emission cause cascade cellular modification include known signaling pathway interact remodel adaptive growth defense tradeoff the compelling evidence isoprene signaling found shikimate phenylpropanoid pathway produce salicylic acid alkaloid tannin anthocyanins flavonols flavonoid role stress tolerance plant defense isoprene also influence key gene expression pattern terpenoid biosynthetic pathway jasmonic acid gibberellic acid cytokinin signaling network important role controlling inducible defense response influencing plant growth development particularly following defoliation in synthesis paper using past study transgenic poplar tobacco arabidopsis present evidence isoprene acting metabolite coordinate aspect cellular signaling resulting enhanced chemical defense period climate stress minimizing cost growth this perspective represents major shift thinking away direct effect isoprene example changing membrane property quenching ros indirect effect change gene expression protein abundance recognition isoprene role growth defense tradeoff provides new perspective evolution trait contribution plant adaptation resilience ecological niche effective,low
501,MAIZE GENES INDUCED BY HERBIVORY AND VOLICITIN,"In crop plants, both mechanical damage and insect attack trigger rapid changes in gene transcription. We investigated whether insect herbivory differs from a general wound response, and if so, is the induction specific to the pest/host plant interaction? Herbivory by beet armyworm (BAW; Spodoptera exigua) caterpillars on maize results in a unique pattern of volatile compounds not triggered by wounding alone that attracts the generalist parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris. Caterpillar-induced volatile emission can be mimicked when a component of the BAW oral secretions (N-(17-hydroxylinolenoyl)-L-glutamine) termed volicitin, is applied to wounded leaves. We identified genes that are affected by BAW feeding by comparing volicitin treatment with wounding alone. We compared cDNAs from these two populations by isolating genes from a subtractive library and using reverse northerns. Virtual northern blots confirmed these results and further showed that BAW infestation affected the expression of these genes. In some cases, BAW feeding inhibited the expression of volicitin-induced genes, suggesting the role of additional bioactive components in caterpillar regurgitate. Transcripts involved in volatile production are increased by volicitin and BAW infestation treatments, and are also detectable at low levels in mechanically wounded leaves. Finally, we identified three new sesquiterpene cyclase genes that are induced by volicitin.",in crop plant mechanical damage insect attack trigger rapid change gene transcription we investigated whether insect herbivory differs general wound response induction specific pest host plant interaction herbivory beet armyworm baw spodoptera exigua caterpillar maize result unique pattern volatile compound triggered wounding alone attracts generalist parasitoid cotesia marginiventris caterpillar induced volatile emission mimicked component baw oral secretion n hydroxylinolenoyl l glutamine termed volicitin applied wounded leaf we identified gene affected baw feeding comparing volicitin treatment wounding alone we compared cdnas two population isolating gene subtractive library using reverse northern virtual northern blot confirmed result showed baw infestation affected expression gene in case baw feeding inhibited expression volicitin induced gene suggesting role additional bioactive component caterpillar regurgitate transcripts involved volatile production increased volicitin baw infestation treatment also detectable low level mechanically wounded leaf finally identified three new sesquiterpene cyclase gene induced volicitin,low
502,Metabolic and Gene Expression Controls on the Production of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds,"The emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), including isoprenoid compounds, methanol and oxygenated organic compounds, is controlled by both the existing metabolic potential of a leaf and gene expression responses that modulate the existing metabolic potential to increase or decrease compound biosynthesis and emission rate. This capability to respond both instantaneously and in the long term to environmental variation provides plants with flexibility in their adaptions to biotic and abiotic stresses, which are also encountered in short and long-term time frames. This chapter reviews the mechanistic basis of the immediate controls of volatile BVOC emissions by light, temperature, and ambient CO2 and O2 concentrations, as well as the genetic responses that involve changes in gene expression patterns. Photosynthesis ultimately provides the carbon for BVOC production, though under non-stressed conditions the photosynthetic rate itself is rarely so low that it limits BVOC emissions. However, various metabolic pathways compete for substrates that are produced from photosynthate, including cytosolic pathways, such as the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and chloroplastic pathways such as the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP). Controls over the use of substrate are regulated among these pathways through feedback mechanisms, specificity in the transport of metabolites across organelle membranes, and the channeling of NADPH reductant and ATP to specific steps in the pathways. This chapter emphasizes that these interactive controls provide the major explanation for longer-term physiological controls of emissions. Emissions of several types of compounds are considered, including isoprenoids, methanol, and green leaf volatiles such as various aldehydes and ketones.",the emission biogenic volatile organic compound bvocs including isoprenoid compound methanol oxygenated organic compound controlled existing metabolic potential leaf gene expression response modulate existing metabolic potential increase decrease compound biosynthesis emission rate this capability respond instantaneously long term environmental variation provides plant flexibility adaption biotic abiotic stress also encountered short long term time frame this chapter review mechanistic basis immediate control volatile bvoc emission light temperature ambient co o concentration well genetic response involve change gene expression pattern photosynthesis ultimately provides carbon bvoc production though non stressed condition photosynthetic rate rarely low limit bvoc emission however various metabolic pathway compete substrate produced photosynthate including cytosolic pathway mevalonic acid mva pathway chloroplastic pathway c methyl d erythritol phosphate deoxy d xylulose phosphate pathway mep doxp controls use substrate regulated among pathway feedback mechanism specificity transport metabolite across organelle membrane channeling nadph reductant atp specific step pathway this chapter emphasizes interactive control provide major explanation longer term physiological control emission emissions several type compound considered including isoprenoids methanol green leaf volatile various aldehyde ketone,high
503,Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology for isoprenoid production in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Isoprenoids, often called terpenoids, are the most abundant and highly diverse family of natural organic compounds. In plants, they play a distinct role in the form of photosynthetic pigments, hormones, electron carrier, structural components of membrane, and defence. Many isoprenoids have useful applications in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and chemical industries. They are synthesized by various isoprenoid synthase enzymes by several consecutive steps. Recent advancement in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology has enabled the production of these isoprenoids in the heterologous host systems like Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both heterologous systems have been engineered for large-scale production of value-added isoprenoids.

They are ubiquitous in nature and take over crucial roles in many biological processes as for example photosynthesis, vision, and the quenching of free radicals and singlet oxygen. Due to their color and their potential beneficial effects on human health, carotenoids receive increasing attention. Carotenoids can be classified due to the length of their carbon backbone. Most carotenoids have a C40 backbone, but also C30 and C50 carotenoids are known. All carotenoids are derived from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) as a common precursor. Pathways leading to IPP as well as metabolic engineering of IPP synthesis and C40 carotenoid production have been reviewed expertly elsewhere.

Most isoprenoids are secondary plant metabolites and only produced in very low amounts. To make these valuable compounds economically accessible, significant efforts in the culture and engineering of microbial cells for isoprenoid biosynthesis have been made in the last decades.

509,Molecular and Pathway Controls on Biogenic Volatile Organic Compound Emissions,"Plants make a number of volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), many of which are emitted in a light- and temperature-dependent manner. The vast majority of these BVOCs are isoprenoids including isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. The total BVOC flux into the atmosphere is on the order of a petagram (1015 g) and has multiple effects on atmospheric chemistry. Understanding the biochemical and molecular regulation of BVOC emissions allows us to build prediction models that better reflect the underlying physiological and biochemical processes. In this chapter we review the enzymes and pathways involved in the biosynthesis of various BVOCs that originate from plants, using isoprene as a model. The biochemical and molecular control of BVOC emission in response to short-term environment drivers such as temperature, light, CO2, and O2, and long-term factors such as circadian, seasonal, and developmental effects are discussed. An emerging theme in the regulation of isoprene emission is that the enzyme isoprene synthase controls the basal emission rate in the long term, while the responses of isoprene emission to short-term factors are regulated by levels of the substrate (dimethylallyl diphosphate), which is in turn determined by upstream enzymes. In addition, we propose a new hypothesis to explain the high-CO2 suppression of isoprene emission. At high CO2 concentrations, a high cytosolic inorganic phosphate (Pi) gradient needed to transport triose phosphates out of the chloroplasts could work against the transport of phosphoenol pyruvate into the chloroplasts. This altered partitioning of phosphoenol pyruvate would then reduce the supply of pyruvate into the MEP pathway. Much work is still needed to understand the CO2 response of BVOC emissions but we expect to see significant progress in the near future.",plants make number volatile organic compound bvocs many emitted light temperature dependent manner the vast majority bvocs isoprenoids including isoprene monoterpenes sesquiterpenes the total bvoc flux atmosphere order petagram g multiple effect atmospheric chemistry understanding biochemical molecular regulation bvoc emission allows u build prediction model better reflect underlying physiological biochemical process in chapter review enzyme pathway involved biosynthesis various bvocs originate plant using isoprene model the biochemical molecular control bvoc emission response short term environment driver temperature light co o long term factor circadian seasonal developmental effect discussed an emerging theme regulation isoprene emission enzyme isoprene synthase control basal emission rate long term response isoprene emission short term factor regulated level substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate turn determined upstream enzyme in addition propose new hypothesis explain high co suppression isoprene emission at high co concentration high cytosolic inorganic phosphate pi gradient needed transport triose phosphate chloroplast could work transport phosphoenol pyruvate chloroplast this altered partitioning phosphoenol pyruvate would reduce supply pyruvate mep pathway much work still needed understand co response bvoc emission expect see significant progress near future,low
510,Molecular Engineering of Monoterpene Production,"The terpenoids (often referred to as isoprenoids) constitute the largest group of natural products, with more than 22, 000 individual structures now known (1). They are all derived from the sequential addition of branched, five-carbon isopentenoid (isoprenoid) units, and range in size from isoprene (C5H8) to natural rubber (molecular weight greater than 106). In plants, the terpenoids and meroterpenoids (in which the terpenoid comprises a part of a larger molecule) play a broad range of metabolic and physiological roles, for example in photosynthesis (chlorophyll side chains, carotenoids, phylloquinones, plastoquinones), respiration (ubiquinone), cell membrane architecture (sterols), regulation of growth and development (gibberellins, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids), defense mechanisms (as phytoalexins, insect feeding and oviposition deterrents, competitive phytotoxins), and reproduction (as attractants of pollinators and seed dispersing animals). Additionally, isoprenylation of proteins by addition of a C15 or C20 olefinic chain provides a means of membrane anchoring, for example of cell cycle-regulating proteins.

511,Monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in glandular trichomes of peppermint (Mentha x piperita) rely exclusively on plastid-derived isopentenyl diphosphate,"The subcellular compartmentation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) synthesis was examined in secretory cells isolated from glandular trichomes of peppermint (Mentha x piperita L. cv. Black Mitcham). As a consequence of their anatomy and the conditions of their isolation, the isolated secretory cells are non-specifically permeable to low-molecular-weight water-soluble metabolites. Thus, the cytoplasm is readily accessible to the exogenous buffer whereas the selective permeability of subcellular organelles is maintained. With the appropriate choice of exogenous substrates, this feature allows the assessment of cytoplasmic and organellar (e.g. plastidic) metabolism in situ. Glycolytic substrates such as [14C]glucose-6-phosphate and [14C]pyruvic acid are incorporated into both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes with a monoterpene:sesquiterpene ratio that closely mimics that observed in vivo, indicating that the correct subcellular partitioning of these substrates is maintained in this model system. Additionally, exogenous [14C]mevalonic acid and [14C]IPP, which are both intitially metabolized in the cytoplasm, produce an abnormally high proportion of sesquiterpenes. In contrast, incubation with either [14C]citrate or [14C]acetyl-CoA results in the accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) with no detectable isoprenoids formed. Taken together, these results indicate that the cytoplasmic mevalonic acid pathway is blocked at HMG-CoA reductase and that the IPP utilized for both monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis is synthesized exclusively in the plastids.",the subcellular compartmentation isopentenyl diphosphate ipp synthesis examined secretory cell isolated glandular trichomes peppermint mentha x piperita l cv black mitcham as consequence anatomy condition isolation isolated secretory cell non specifically permeable low molecular weight water soluble metabolite thus cytoplasm readily accessible exogenous buffer whereas selective permeability subcellular organelle maintained with appropriate choice exogenous substrate feature allows assessment cytoplasmic organellar e g plastidic metabolism situ glycolytic substrate c glucose phosphate c pyruvic acid incorporated monoterpenes sesquiterpenes monoterpene sesquiterpene ratio closely mimic observed vivo indicating correct subcellular partitioning substrate maintained model system additionally exogenous c mevalonic acid c ipp intitially metabolized cytoplasm produce abnormally high proportion sesquiterpenes in contrast incubation either c citrate c acetyl coa result accumulation hydroxy methylglutaryl coa hmg coa detectable isoprenoids formed taken together result indicate cytoplasmic mevalonic acid pathway blocked hmg coa reductase ipp utilized monoterpene sesquiterpene biosynthesis synthesized exclusively plastid,low

515,On the Evolution and Functional Diversity of Terpene Synthases in the Pinus Species: A Review,"In the biosynthesis of terpenoids, the ample catalytic versatility of terpene synthases (TPS) allows the formation of thousands of different molecules. A steadily increasing number of sequenced plant genomes invariably show that the TPS gene family is medium to large in size, comprising from 30 to 100 functional members. In conifers, TPSs belonging to the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily produce a complex mixture of mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenoid specialized metabolites, which are found in volatile emissions and oleoresin secretions. Such substances are involved in the defence against pathogens and herbivores and can help to protect against abiotic stress. Oleoresin terpenoids can be also profitably used in a number of different fields, from traditional and modern medicine to fine chemicals, fragrances, and flavours, and, in the last years, in biorefinery too. In the present work, after summarizing the current views on the biosynthesis and biological functions of terpenoids, recent advances on the evolution and functional diversification of plant TPSs are reviewed, with a focus on gymnosperms. In such context, an extensive characterization and phylogeny of all the known TPSs from different Pinus species is reported, which, for such genus, can be seen as the first effort to explore the evolutionary history of the large family of TPS genes involved in specialized metabolism.

516,Plant Secondary Metabolites: Functions in Plants and Pharmacological Importance,"Plant secondary metabolites are the organic compounds that are not necessary for growth or reproduction of plants, but which can be demonstrated genetically, physiologically, or biochemically. Of the estimated 400,000–500,000 plant species, only a small percentage has been investigated for their ethanopharmacological value, and even a lower fraction has been exploited to get the active pharmaceutical ingredients. Studies have revealed that the ability of plants to synthesize secondary metabolites is directly related to their course of evolution, and these metabolites fulfill physiological needs of plants such as attracting pollinators, protecting from pests and pathogens, enabling the plant to tolerate environmental stress, etc. The evolution of secondary metabolism is primarily from the primary metabolism by alterations in certain enzymes and pathways. This chapter provides an overview of the diversity of plant secondary metabolites in terms of their structure, function, and biosynthesis. Further research is needed to understand the chemical interactions between different plant species, and between plants and other organisms so that the potential secondary metabolites can be traced for novel uses by mankind.",plant secondary metabolite organic compound necessary growth reproduction plant demonstrated genetically physiologically biochemically of estimated plant specie small percentage investigated ethanopharmacological value even lower fraction exploited get active pharmaceutical ingredient studies revealed ability plant synthesize secondary metabolite directly related course evolution metabolite fulfill physiological need plant attracting pollinator protecting pest pathogen enabling plant tolerate environmental stress etc the evolution secondary metabolism primarily primary metabolism alteration certain enzyme pathway this chapter provides overview diversity plant secondary metabolite term structure function biosynthesis further research needed understand chemical interaction different plant specie plant organism potential secondary metabolite traced novel us mankind,low
517,Overexpression of Panax ginseng sesquiterpene synthase gene confers tolerance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Sesquiterpenes are an abundant group belonging to the terpenoid family, with a C15 structure comprise of three isoprene units. Many sesquiterpenes are volatile compounds and it act as chemical messenger in plant signalling, particularly in the defense mechanism against biotic and abiotic stresses. Panax ginseng Meyer is important medicinal herbs with various reported pharmacological efficacies in which its triterpenoid saponins, called ginsenosides, were mostly studied. However, there have been few studies on volatile sesquiterpenes compounds regulation on P. ginseng. As slow-growing perennial plant, P. ginseng received many kind of stresses during its cultivation. The pathogen attack is one of the most devastated perturbation for ginseng yield. Thus, we aimed to analyze P. ginseng STS gene (PgSTS) expressions in ginseng organs as well as mono-, sesquiterpenes contents from ginseng seedlings treated with elicitors. qRT-PCR and GC-MS analysis showed that two elicitors- salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) triggered PgSTS expression at different time points and significantly induced mono-, sesquiterpene yield. Overexpression of PgSTS in Arabidopsis also induced high terpene content and conferred tolerance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato infection. These results suggested that PgSTS transcripts are involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in response to environmental stress mediated by MeJA and SA elicitors; thus, generate tolerance against pathogen attack.",sesquiterpenes abundant group belonging terpenoid family c structure comprise three isoprene unit many sesquiterpenes volatile compound act chemical messenger plant signalling particularly defense mechanism biotic abiotic stress panax ginseng meyer important medicinal herb various reported pharmacological efficacy triterpenoid saponin called ginsenosides mostly studied however study volatile sesquiterpenes compound regulation p ginseng as slow growing perennial plant p ginseng received many kind stress cultivation the pathogen attack one devastated perturbation ginseng yield thus aimed analyze p ginseng sts gene pgsts expression ginseng organ well mono sesquiterpenes content ginseng seedling treated elicitors qrt pcr gc ms analysis showed two elicitors salicylic acid sa methyl jasmonate meja triggered pgsts expression different time point significantly induced mono sesquiterpene yield overexpression pgsts arabidopsis also induced high terpene content conferred tolerance pseudomonas syringae pv tomato infection these result suggested pgsts transcript involved terpenoid biosynthesis response environmental stress mediated meja sa elicitors thus generate tolerance pathogen attack,low
518,Ozone-Induced Changes in Plant Secondary Metabolism,"In their ecosystem, plants have to cope with a plethora of potentially unfavourable conditions. Stress factors affecting plant’s fitness not only derive from natural sources, such as adverse temperature fluctuations (heating, chilling and freezing), high irradiance (photoinhibition, photooxidation), osmotic imbalance (salinity and drought), hypoxia/anoxia (flooding), mineral (macro- and micronutrient) deficiency, wounding, phytophagy and pathogen attack, but also from anthropogenic activities. The latter include xenobiotics employed in agriculture (herbicide, pesticides and fungicides), environmental (air, soil and water) pollutants and increased UV radiations. Particularly, many atmospheric pollutants, belonging to greenhouse gases, may increase the greenhouse effect, a natural warming process that prevents heat from diffusing to the outer atmosphere, thus balancing Earth cooling processes. Without the natural greenhouse effect, temperature on Earth would be much lower than it is now, and the existence of life would have not been possible. However, the rising emissions of greenhouse gases due to anthropogenic activities, namely carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), nitrous oxide (N2O), tropospheric ozone (O3) and water vapour, may cause a short-term increase of the mean global temperature on the planet surface with consequent changes in precipitation patterns (Krupa and Kickert 1989). In this scenario, life on the earth depended from the co-evolution between atmosphere and biosphere, because the gradual and long-term climate changes enabled living organism adaptation to the new temperatures, precipitation patterns and other climate conditions (Voronin and Black 2007).",in ecosystem plant cope plethora potentially unfavourable condition stress factor affecting plant fitness derive natural source adverse temperature fluctuation heating chilling freezing high irradiance photoinhibition photooxidation osmotic imbalance salinity drought hypoxia anoxia flooding mineral macro micronutrient deficiency wounding phytophagy pathogen attack also anthropogenic activity the latter include xenobiotics employed agriculture herbicide pesticide fungicide environmental air soil water pollutant increased uv radiation particularly many atmospheric pollutant belonging greenhouse gas may increase greenhouse effect natural warming process prevents heat diffusing outer atmosphere thus balancing earth cooling process without natural greenhouse effect temperature earth would much lower existence life would possible however rising emission greenhouse gas due anthropogenic activity namely carbon dioxide co chlorofluorocarbon cfcs nitrous oxide n o tropospheric ozone o water vapour may cause short term increase mean global temperature planet surface consequent change precipitation pattern krupa kickert in scenario life earth depended co evolution atmosphere biosphere gradual long term climate change enabled living organism adaptation new temperature precipitation pattern climate condition voronin black,low
519,Paradigm of Monoterpene (ß-phellandrene) Hydrocarbons Production via Photosynthesis in Cyanobacteria,"A direct “photosynthesis-to-fuels” approach envisions application of a single organism, absorbing sunlight, photosynthesizing, and converting the primary products of photosynthesis into ready-made fuel. The work reported here applied this concept for the photosynthetic generation of monoterpene (ß-phellandrene) hydrocarbons in the unicellular cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Heterologous expression of a codon-optimized Lavandula angustifolia ß-phellandrene synthase (ß-PHLS) gene in Synechocystis enabled photosynthetic generation of ß-phellandrene in these microorganisms. ß-phellandrene accumulation occurred constitutively and in tandem with biomass accumulation, generated from sunlight, CO2, and H2O. Results showed that ß-phellandrene diffused through the plasma membrane and cell wall of the cyanobacteria and accumulated on the surface of the liquid culture. Spontaneous ß-phellandrene separation from the biomass and its removal from the liquid phase alleviated product inhibition of cellular metabolism and enabled a continuous production process. The work showed that oxygenic photosynthesis can be directed to generate monoterpene hydrocarbons, while consuming CO2, without a prior requirement for the harvesting, dewatering, and processing of the respective biomass.",a direct photosynthesis fuel approach envisions application single organism absorbing sunlight photosynthesizing converting primary product photosynthesis ready made fuel the work reported applied concept photosynthetic generation monoterpene phellandrene hydrocarbon unicellular cyanobacteria synechocystis sp pcc heterologous expression codon optimized lavandula angustifolia phellandrene synthase phls gene synechocystis enabled photosynthetic generation phellandrene microorganism phellandrene accumulation occurred constitutively tandem biomass accumulation generated sunlight co h o results showed phellandrene diffused plasma membrane cell wall cyanobacteria accumulated surface liquid culture spontaneous phellandrene separation biomass removal liquid phase alleviated product inhibition cellular metabolism enabled continuous production process the work showed oxygenic photosynthesis directed generate monoterpene hydrocarbon consuming co without prior requirement harvesting dewatering processing respective biomass,low
520,"Pathways for Carotenoid Biosynthesis, Degradation, and Storage","Carotenoids are isoprenoid compounds synthesized de novo in all photosynthetic organisms as well as in some nonphotosynthetic bacteria and fungi. In plants, carotenoids are essential for light harvesting and photoprotection. They contribute to the vivid color found in many plant organs. The cleavage of carotenoids produces small molecules (apocarotenoids) that serve as aroma compounds, as well as phytohormones and signals to affect plant growth and development. Since carotenoids provide valuable nutrition and health benefits for humans, understanding of carotenoid biosynthesis, catabolism and storage is important for biofortification of crops with improved nutritional quality. This chapter primarily introduces our current knowledge about carotenoid biosynthesis and degradation pathways as well as carotenoid storage in plants.",carotenoids isoprenoid compound synthesized de novo photosynthetic organism well nonphotosynthetic bacteria fungi in plant carotenoid essential light harvesting photoprotection they contribute vivid color found many plant organ the cleavage carotenoid produce small molecule apocarotenoids serve aroma compound well phytohormone signal affect plant growth development since carotenoid provide valuable nutrition health benefit human understanding carotenoid biosynthesis catabolism storage important biofortification crop improved nutritional quality this chapter primarily introduces current knowledge carotenoid biosynthesis degradation pathway well carotenoid storage plant,low
521,Plant geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases: every (gene) family has a story,"Plant isoprenoids (also known as terpenes or terpenoids) are a wide family of primary and secondary metabolites with multiple functions. In particular, most photosynthesis-related isoprenoids (including carotenoids and chlorophylls) as well as diterpenes and polyterpenes derive from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) produced by GGPP synthase (GGPPS) enzymes in several cell compartments. Plant genomes typically harbor multiple copies of differentially expressed genes encoding GGPPS-like proteins. While sequence comparisons allow to identify potential GGPPS candidates, experimental evidence is required to ascertain their enzymatic activity and biological function. Actually, functional analyses of the full set of potential GGPPS paralogs are only available for a handful of plant species. Here we review our current knowledge on the GGPPS families of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop species rice (Oryza sativa), pepper (Capsicum annuum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The results indicate that a major determinant of the biological role of particular GGPPS paralogs is the expression profile of the corresponding genes even though specific interactions with other proteins (including GGPP-consuming enzymes) might also contribute to subfunctionalization. In some species, however, a single GGPPS isoforms appears to be responsible for the production of most if not all GGPP required for cell functions. Deciphering the mechanisms regulating GGPPS activity in particular cell compartments, tissues, organs and plant species will be very useful for future metabolic engineering approaches aimed to manipulate the accumulation of particular GGPP-derived products of interest without negatively impacting the levels of other isoprenoids required to sustain essential cell functions.",plant isoprenoids also known terpene terpenoids wide family primary secondary metabolite multiple function in particular photosynthesis related isoprenoids including carotenoid chlorophyll well diterpenes polyterpenes derive geranylgeranyl diphosphate ggpp produced ggpp synthase ggpps enzyme several cell compartment plant genome typically harbor multiple copy differentially expressed gene encoding ggpps like protein while sequence comparison allow identify potential ggpps candidate experimental evidence required ascertain enzymatic activity biological function actually functional analysis full set potential ggpps paralogs available handful plant specie here review current knowledge ggpps family model plant arabidopsis thaliana crop specie rice oryza sativa pepper capsicum annuum tomato solanum lycopersicum the result indicate major determinant biological role particular ggpps paralogs expression profile corresponding gene even though specific interaction protein including ggpp consuming enzyme might also contribute subfunctionalization in specie however single ggpps isoforms appears responsible production ggpp required cell function deciphering mechanism regulating ggpps activity particular cell compartment tissue organ plant specie useful future metabolic engineering approach aimed manipulate accumulation particular ggpp derived product interest without negatively impacting level isoprenoids required sustain essential cell function,low

We here investigate the potential of the mushroom Schizophyllum commune for the production of sesquiterpenes. Genomic analysis of S. commune revealed that the mevalonate pathway required for the synthesis of the farnesyl diphosphate substrate for sesquiterpene production is operational. Introduction of a valencene synthase gene resulted in production of the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene, both in mycelium and in fruiting bodies. Levels of (+)-valencene in culture media of strains containing a mutated RGS regulatory protein gene (thn) were increased fourfold compared to those in wild-type transformants. Up to 16 mg L-1 (+)-valencene was produced in these strains. In addition, the amount of (+)-valencene containing n-dodecane recovered from the culture medium increased sixfold to sevenfold in the thn mutant strains due to the absence of schizophyllan.",production commercially interesting sesquiterpenes previously examined plant microorganism escherichia coli saccharomyces cerevisiae we investigate potential mushroom schizophyllum commune production sesquiterpenes genomic analysis s commune revealed mevalonate pathway required synthesis farnesyl diphosphate substrate sesquiterpene production operational introduction valencene synthase gene resulted production sesquiterpene valencene mycelium fruiting body levels valencene culture medium strain containing mutated rgs regulatory protein gene thn increased fourfold compared wild type transformants up mg l valencene produced strain in addition amount valencene containing n dodecane recovered culture medium increased sixfold sevenfold thn mutant strain due absence schizophyllan,low

525,Production of Industrially Relevant Isoprenoid Compounds in Engineered Microbes,"Isoprenoids are the largest class of natural compounds and have extremely diverse chemical and functional properties. They are involved in many different cellular processes, including hormonal regulation, signalling, pest/pathogen defence and redox status. They also provide many of the colours, flavours and aromas found in biology. The diversity of isoprenoids lends them to a wide variety of biotechnological applications, both by exploiting their myriad natural functions and by using them as industrial chemicals/chemical feedstocks. These applications range from fine chemicals (pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, antimicrobials) through mid-volume (flavours, fragrances, colourants, fuel additives) and bulk (fuels, synthetic polymers, agricultural chemicals, etc.) products. However, in their natural context, individual isoprenoids are not usually found at sufficient abundance for industrial use. Moreover, extraction and/or purification may be difficult and/or expensive, or production may be highly variable, making industrial production processes challenging or impossible. Artificial synthesis is often not possible due to complexity, expense or other chemical properties/requirements. Consequently, there is a strong movement towards bioengineering of microbes for production of these valuable compounds in controlled fermentation conditions. Here we consider the requirements for developing economically viable isoprenoid production bioprocesses as well as the current state of the art in engineering production in microbes.

Production methods are provided for isoprene, limonene, and lycopene as examples for each class. Specific analytical methods are provided for isoprene, limonene, terpinolene, caryophyllene, amorphadiene, linalool, nerolidol, pinene and lycopene.

529,Quantitative assessment of crosstalk between the two isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways in plants by NMR spectroscopy,"Plants have been shown to use the mevalonate pathway for the biosynthesis of sterols and triterpenes in the cytoplasm and the recently discovered deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway for the biosynthesis of a variety of hemiterpenes, monoterpenes, diterpenes, as well as for the biosynthesis of carotenoids and the phytol side chain of chlorophyll in plastids. Despite the compartmental separation, at least one terpene precursor can be exchanged between the two pathways. In order to assess quantitatively the crosstalk between the two isoprenoid pathways, [2-13C1]mevalonolactone or [U-13C6]glucose were supplied to cell cultures of Catharanthus roseus grown under illumination or in darkness. Sitosterol, lutein and phytol were isolated and analysed by NMR spectroscopy. The incorporations of exogenous [2-13C1]mevalonolactone were 48% and 7% into the DMAPP and IPP precursors of sitosterol and lutein, respectively. With [U-13C6]glucose as precursor, at least 95% of sitosterol precursors were obtained via the mevalonate pathway, whereas phytol appeared to be biosynthesised via the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway (approximately 60%) as well via the mevalonate pathway (approximately 40%). The apparent ratios for the contribution of the two pathways depend on the nature of the precursor supplied as well as the nature of the target compound. Thus, crosstalk between the two terpenoid pathways cannot be explained in detail by a simple two compartment model and requires an additional in depth study of complex regulatory mechanisms.",plants shown use mevalonate pathway biosynthesis sterol triterpenes cytoplasm recently discovered deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway biosynthesis variety hemiterpenes monoterpenes diterpenes well biosynthesis carotenoid phytol side chain chlorophyll plastid despite compartmental separation least one terpene precursor exchanged two pathway in order ass quantitatively crosstalk two isoprenoid pathway c mevalonolactone u c glucose supplied cell culture catharanthus roseus grown illumination darkness sitosterol lutein phytol isolated analysed nmr spectroscopy the incorporation exogenous c mevalonolactone dmapp ipp precursor sitosterol lutein respectively with u c glucose precursor least sitosterol precursor obtained via mevalonate pathway whereas phytol appeared biosynthesised via deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway approximately well via mevalonate pathway approximately the apparent ratio contribution two pathway depend nature precursor supplied well nature target compound thus crosstalk two terpenoid pathway cannot explained detail simple two compartment model requires additional depth study complex regulatory mechanism,high

Despite increasing research into the genetic control of important adaptive traits in some plant species, the genetic control of terpenes in forest tree species is still relatively poorly studied. In this study, we use quantitative genetic and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis to investigate the genetic control of foliar terpenes in an ecologically and commercially important eucalypt species, Eucalyptus globulus. We show a moderate to high within-family broad-sense heritability and significant genetic basis to the variation in 14 of the 16 terpenes assayed. This is the first report of QTL for terpenes in this species. Eleven QTL influenced the terpenes overall. One QTL on linkage group 6 affected six of the seven different sesquiterpenes assayed (plus one monoterpene), which, in combination with highly significant correlations between these compounds, argues that their variation is influenced by a QTL with pleiotropic effect early in the biosynthetic pathway.

Cabernet Sauvignon roots to the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Funneliformis mosseae and the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Ensifer meliloti include changes in volatile organic compounds,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are beneficial microorganisms that may associate with grapevine roots, improving stress tolerance, growth, and nutrition. AM fungi and PGPR enhance the production of plant secondary metabolites, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that play a key role in the interaction of plants with the environment and are involved in defence mechanisms. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of an AM fungus and a rhizobacterium on plant growth and VOCs in Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon roots to gain insight into the potential role of plant-rhizosphere microorganisms in vine growth and defence. Grapevines were inoculated or not with the AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae IN101 and/or the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Ensifer meliloti TSA41. Both microbial strains enhanced plant growth. Fifty-eight VOCs extracted from ground roots were identified using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

533,Rice terpene synthase 20 (OsTPS20) plays an important role in producing terpene volatiles in response to abiotic stresses,"This study examined the volatile terpenes produced by rice seedlings in response to oxidative stress induced by various abiotic factors. Solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME–GC–MS) analyses revealed that when exposed to UV-B radiation, rice seedlings emitted a bouquet of monoterpene mixtures in a time-dependent manner. The mixtures comprised limonene, sabinene, myrcene, a-terpinene, ß-ocimene, ?-terpinene, and a-terpinolene. Among them, (S)-limonene was the most abundant volatile, discriminated by chiral SPME–GC–MS. The volatile profiles collected from rice plants treated with both ?-irradiation and H2O2 were identical to those observed in the UV-B irradiated plants, thus indicating that the volatile mixtures were specifically produced in response to oxidative stress, particularly in the presence of H2O2. Using a reverse genetics approach, we isolated full-length rice terpene synthase 20 (OsTPS20, 599 amino acids, 69.39 kDa), which was further characterized as an (S)-limonene synthase by removing the N-terminal signal peptide (63 amino acids) of the protein.

535,Role of Plant Peroxisomes in Protection Against Herbivores,"Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles of vital importance. They are ubiquitous, have a single membrane and execute numerous metabolic reactions in plants. Plant peroxisomes are multifaceted and have diverse functions including, but not limited to, photomorphogenesis, lipid metabolism, photorespiration, nitrogen metabolism, detoxification and plant biotic interactions. Plants have evolved a variety of defence barriers against herbivory. These barriers are unique and loaded with various metabolites. Peroxisomes play an important role in cells, maintaining the compartmentation of certain specific reactions. They serve as a first line of defence, as peroxisomes generate primary signals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Both ROS and RNS sense the invasion by herbivores and dramatically reshape the plant transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes, so indicating the importance of signals generated by peroxisomes. Peroxisomes also store a plethora of important enzymes, which have a key role in producing defence molecules. Some of the main enzymes in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids are present in peroxisomes. These enzymes generate plant volatiles, which have numerous functions and important roles in plant-herbivore communication.",peroxisomes subcellular organelle vital importance they ubiquitous single membrane execute numerous metabolic reaction plant plant peroxisomes multifaceted diverse function including limited photomorphogenesis lipid metabolism photorespiration nitrogen metabolism detoxification plant biotic interaction plants evolved variety defence barrier herbivory these barrier unique loaded various metabolite peroxisomes play important role cell maintaining compartmentation certain specific reaction they serve first line defence peroxisomes generate primary signal reactive oxygen specie ros reactive nitrogen specie rns both ros rns sense invasion herbivore dramatically reshape plant transcriptomes proteome metabolomes indicating importance signal generated peroxisomes peroxisomes also store plethora important enzyme key role producing defence molecule some main enzyme biosynthesis isoprenoids present peroxisomes these enzyme generate plant volatile numerous function important role plant herbivore communication,high
536,Role of Secondary Metabolites and Brassinosteroids in Plant Defense Against Environmental Stresses,"Being sessile, plants are subjected to a diverse array of environmental stresses during their life span. Exposure of plants to environmental stresses results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These activated oxygen species tend to oxidize various cellular biomolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, a process that challenges the core existence of the cell. To prevent the accumulation of these ROS and to sustain their own survival, plants have developed an intricate antioxidative defence system. The antioxidative defence system comprises various enzymatic and nonenzymatic molecules, produced to counter the adverse effect of environmental stresses. A sizable number of these molecules belong to the category of compounds called secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the growth and development of plants but perform specialized functions under a given set of conditions. Absence of secondary metabolites results in long-term impairment of the plant’s survivability. Such compounds generally include pigments, phenolics, and so on. Plant phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and lignin precursors have been reported to accumulate in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses and are regarded as crucial defence compounds that can scavenge harmful ROS. Another important category of plant metabolites, called brassinosteroids, exhibit stress regulatory and growth-promoting activity and are classified as phytohormones. Elucidation of the physiological and molecular effects of secondary metabolites and brassinosteroids have catapulted them as highly promising and environment-friendly natural substances, suitable for wider application in plant protection and crop yield promotion. The present review focuses on our current understanding of how plants respond to the generation of excessive ROS and the role of secondary metabolites and brassinosteroids in countering the adverse effects of environmental stresses.",being sessile plant subjected diverse array environmental stress life span exposure plant environmental stress result generation reactive oxygen specie ros these activated oxygen specie tend oxidize various cellular biomolecules like protein nucleic acid lipid process challenge core existence cell to prevent accumulation ros sustain survival plant developed intricate antioxidative defence system the antioxidative defence system comprises various enzymatic nonenzymatic molecule produced counter adverse effect environmental stress a sizable number molecule belong category compound called secondary metabolite secondary metabolite organic compound directly involved growth development plant perform specialized function given set condition absence secondary metabolite result long term impairment plant survivability such compound generally include pigment phenolic plant phenolic compound flavonoid lignin precursor reported accumulate response various biotic abiotic stress regarded crucial defence compound scavenge harmful ros another important category plant metabolite called brassinosteroids exhibit stress regulatory growth promoting activity classified phytohormone elucidation physiological molecular effect secondary metabolite brassinosteroids catapulted highly promising environment friendly natural substance suitable wider application plant protection crop yield promotion the present review focus current understanding plant respond generation excessive ros role secondary metabolite brassinosteroids countering adverse effect environmental stress,medium
537,Signalling During Insect Plant Interaction,"Insects and plants share refined interactions as plants recognize insects via mechanical and chemical hints. The initial response begins at plant cell membrane. Insects interact physically with the membrane and triggers production of signalling molecules in the plant. Herbivore contact causes charge distribution differences across the membrane which eventually leads to calcium signalling cascade. Generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species also follows membrane depolarization. Multiple hormone response pathways leads to appropriate responses, but the primary signalling cassette mediating the information received at the plant-insect interface and starting defence responses in plants is the jasmonate (JA) pathway. Defence responses are initiated by the accumulation of several secondary metabolites and defence proteins. Plants differently prioritize defence response at different developmental stages. Plants release volatile cues to mediate ecological interactions, and these metabolites play pivotal role in plant-herbivore interactions.",insects plant share refined interaction plant recognize insect via mechanical chemical hint the initial response begin plant cell membrane insects interact physically membrane trigger production signalling molecule plant herbivore contact cause charge distribution difference across membrane eventually lead calcium signalling cascade generation reactive oxygen nitrogen specie also follows membrane depolarization multiple hormone response pathway lead appropriate response primary signalling cassette mediating information received plant insect interface starting defence response plant jasmonate ja pathway defence response initiated accumulation several secondary metabolite defence protein plants differently prioritize defence response different developmental stage plants release volatile cue mediate ecological interaction metabolite play pivotal role plant herbivore interaction,low
538,"Exploring plant metabolic genomics: chemical diversity, metabolic complexity in the biosynthesis and transport of specialized metabolites with the tea plant as a model","The diversity and complexity of secondary metabolites in tea plants contribute substantially to the popularity of tea, by determining tea flavors and their numerous health benefits. The most significant characteristics of tea plants are that they concentrate the complex plant secondary metabolites into one leaf: flavonoids, alkaloids, theanine, volatiles, and saponins. Many fundamental questions regarding tea plant secondary metabolism remain unanswered. This includes how tea plants accumulate high levels of monomeric galloylated catechins, unlike the polymerized flavan-3-ols in most other plants, as well as how they are evolved to selectively synthesize theanine and caffeine, and how tea plants properly transport and store these cytotoxic products and then reuse them in defense. Tea plants coordinate many metabolic pathways that simultaneously take place in young tea leaves in response to both developmental and environmental cues. With the available genome sequences of tea plants and high-throughput metabolomic tools as great platforms, it is of particular interest to launch metabolic genomics studies using tea plants as a model system. Plant metabolic genomics are to investigate all aspects of plant secondary metabolism at the genetic, genome, and molecular levels.

539,"Free and glycosidically bound aroma compounds in fruit: biosynthesis, transformation, and practical control","Fruit aroma makes an initial flavor impression and largely determines the consumer preference and acceptance of fruit products. Free volatile organic compounds (FVOCs) directly make up the characteristic aromas of fruits. While glycosidically bound volatile compounds (GBVs) can be hydrolyzed during fruit ripening, postharvest storage, and processing, releasing the attached aglycones as free volatiles that could alter the overall aroma attributes of fruits. GBVs typically exhibit significantly higher concentrations than their free counterparts in fruits such as grapes, cherries, kiwifruits, tomatoes, and tamarillos. This review highlights the biosynthesis of FVOCs and GBVs in fruit and illustrates their biological transformations for various functional purposes such as detoxification, aroma enhancement, plant defense, and pollinator attraction. Practical applications for regulating the levels of aroma compounds emitted or accumulated in fruit are also reviewed, emphasizing the metabolic engineering of free volatile metabolites and hydrolytic technologies on aroma glycosides. Generally, enzymatic hydrolysis using AR2000 is a common strategy to enhance the sensory attributes of fruit juices/wines, while acidic hydrolysis induces the oxidation and rearrangement of aglycones, generating artifacts with off-aromas.

This review summarizes recent research on terpenoids with regard to grape wine. Although, the grapevine terpene synthase gene family is the largest identified, genetic modifications involving terpenes to improve wine flavor have received little attention. Key enzyme modulation alters metabolite production. Over the last decade, the heterologous manipulation of grape glycosidase has been used to alter terpenoids, and cytochrome P450s may affect terpene synthesis.

541,Hop Aroma and Hoppy Beer Flavor: Chemical Backgrounds and Analytical Tools—A Review,"Hops are the most complex and costly raw material used in brewing. Their chemical composition depends on genetically controlled factors that essentially distinguish hop varieties and is influenced by environmental factors and post-harvest processing. The volatile fingerprint of hopped beer relates to the quantity and quality of the hop dosage and timing of hop addition, as well as the overall brewing technology applied. Analytically, the aroma of hops and the flavor of hoppy beers cannot be measured by quantification of a single odorant; moreover, the selection of several key compounds or a comprehensive characterization (profiling) seems reasonable. Analysis of hops and beer is challenging. The selective enrichment of volatiles from complex matrices, separation, unambiguous identification, and precise quantification are the keywords used in this context. This review outlines the synthesis of relevant hop aroma compounds within the plant. The process that incorporates hops into the final beer is described using the hopping techniques used in the industry. Due to the complexity and multiplicity of chemical compounds found in hops, an attempt was made to simplify the information presented by separating the chemical compounds considered into two broad groups: terpenoids and nonterpenoids.

542,Metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways leading to isoprenoids: Mono- and sesquiterpenes in plastids and cytosol,"Isoprenoids are a large and structurally diverse family of compounds that play essential roles in plants as hormones, photosynthetic pigments, electron carriers, and membrane components as well as serving in communication and defense. Now it is unequivocally proved that two distinct and independent biosynthetic routes exist to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the two building blocks for isoprenoids in plants. The cytosolic pathway is triggered by Acetyl Coenzyme A where classical intermediate mevalonic acid is formed which, in turn, converts into IPP and DMAPP. These further combine to elongate into sesquiterpenes (C15) and triterpenes (C30); whereas the plastidial pathway provides precursors for the biosynthesis of isoprene (C5), monoterpenes (C10), diterpenes (C20), and tetraterpenes (C40). The pathway is initiated by the transketolase-type condensation of pyruvate (C-2 and C-3) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DXP), followed by the isomerization and reduction of this intermediate to 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP), formation of the cytidine 5'-diphosphate (CDP) derivative, phosphorylation at C2, and cyclization to 2-C-methylerythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (CDP-Me2P as the last defined step). The genes encoding each enzyme of the plastid pathway up to formation of the cyclic diphosphate have been isolated from plants and from eubacteria where the pathway exists. Studies on the complete biosynthetic pathways using radio-labeled substrates will help in characterizing and identifying the enzymes involved in each and every step of cyclization, isomerization, chain elongation, hydrogen shifts, oxidation and hydroxylation during the formation of many isoprenoid compounds present in food and flavor substances and are highly useful to human beings.",isoprenoids large structurally diverse family compound play essential role plant hormone photosynthetic pigment electron carrier membrane component well serving communication defense now unequivocally proved two distinct independent biosynthetic route exist isopentenyl diphosphate ipp allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate dmapp two building block isoprenoids plant the cytosolic pathway triggered acetyl coenzyme a classical intermediate mevalonic acid formed turn convert ipp dmapp these combine elongate sesquiterpenes c triterpenes c whereas plastidial pathway provides precursor biosynthesis isoprene c monoterpenes c diterpenes c tetraterpenes c the pathway initiated transketolase type condensation pyruvate c c glyceraldehyde phosphate deoxyxylulose phosphate dxp followed isomerization reduction intermediate c methylerythritol phosphate mep formation cytidine diphosphate cdp derivative phosphorylation c cyclization c methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate cdp me p last defined step the gene encoding enzyme plastid pathway formation cyclic diphosphate isolated plant eubacteria pathway exists studies complete biosynthetic pathway using radio labeled substrate help characterizing identifying enzyme involved every step cyclization isomerization chain elongation hydrogen shift oxidation hydroxylation formation many isoprenoid compound present food flavor substance highly useful human being,medium

544,Metabolie Engineering of Floral Scent of Ornamentals,"Flowers of many plant species emit floral scent to attract pollinators. Such scents are often complex mixtures of various small aliphatic molecules, mostly terpenoid, phenylpropanoid, and benzenoid compounds. However, a large number of commercial flower varieties have lost their scent during the traditional breeding process. This lack of scent has been recognized as one of the major problems in the floriculture industry. Recent discoveries of genes encoding enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of scent compounds, and advances in our understanding of the regulation of scent biosynthetic genes, now make it possible to engineer plants with increased scent or with newly introduced aromas. Past approaches for metabolic engineering of floral scent have used various strategies, including the introduction of new scent genes and the blockage of existing non-scent pathways to divert metabolites into scent production. However, these experiments have only been partially successful. Problems have included the lack of specificity in targeting the expression of the introduced gene to flowers and unexpected biochemical reactions that metabolized the new scent compounds into non-volatile byproducts. Future attempts at scent genetic engineering will need to utilize specific floral gene promoters and be based on a clearer understanding of metabolic fluxes.",flowers many plant specie emit floral scent attract pollinator such scent often complex mixture various small aliphatic molecule mostly terpenoid phenylpropanoid benzenoid compound however large number commercial flower variety lost scent traditional breeding process this lack scent recognized one major problem floriculture industry recent discovery gene encoding enzyme catalyzing synthesis scent compound advance understanding regulation scent biosynthetic gene make possible engineer plant increased scent newly introduced aroma past approach metabolic engineering floral scent used various strategy including introduction new scent gene blockage existing non scent pathway divert metabolite scent production however experiment partially successful problems included lack specificity targeting expression introduced gene flower unexpected biochemical reaction metabolized new scent compound non volatile byproduct future attempt scent genetic engineering need utilize specific floral gene promoter based clearer understanding metabolic flux,high

To date, a total of 1700 volatile compounds have been isolated from more than 90 plant families. These volatiles, released from leaves, flowers, and fruits into the atmosphere and from roots into the soil, defend plants against herbivores and pathogens or provide a reproductive advantage by attracting pollinators and seed dispersers. Plant volatiles constitute about 1% of plant secondary metabolites and are mainly represented by terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, fatty acid derivatives, and amino acid derivatives.

Results demonstrated increased accumulation of several proteins, including secondary metabolite-related proteins. The red light (R) (660 nm) highly induced terpenoid proteins. Similar biochemical profiles were observed in white light (W) (445, 544 nm) and blue light (B) (445 nm) conditions, while profiles from R treatment were different. Functional proteins of W and B treatments were involved in the MVA and MEP pathways and sesquiterpene biosynthesis.

549,"Terpenoid Secondary Metabolites in Bryophytes: Chemical Diversity, Biosynthesis and Biological Functions","Bryophytes are close extant relatives of the ancestral land plant. As such, they have retained many innovations that had enabled the adaptation of early land plants to the terrestrial environment. One of such important innovations is the elaboration of an enormously diverse array of secondary metabolites. This article reviews current knowledge of terpenoid secondary metabolites, which constitute the largest family of plant metabolites, in bryophytes from three perspectives: chemical diversity, biosynthesis, and biological functions. The diversity of terpenoids in bryophytes, particularly in liverworts, is enormously rich. More than 1600 terpenoids have been reported from this plant group. While many terpenoids are observed in both bryophytes and seed plants, some are unique to bryophytes. It is just the beginning for us to understand the molecular and biochemical basis underlying terpenoid biosynthesis in bryophytes. Compared to seed plants, which have only one type of terpene synthase genes, so-called typical plant terpene synthase genes, bryophytes employ not only typical plant terpene synthase genes but also another class of terpene synthase genes called microbial-terpene synthase-like (MTPSL) genes for terpenoid biosynthesis. Biochemical studies suggest the MTPSLs are largely responsible for the terpenoid diversity in bryophytes, particularly sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. Existing literature indicates that terpenoids made by bryophytes have important functions in diverse biological and ecological processes, particularly as defenses against biotic and abiotic stresses. The continued development of genomic resources and molecular tool kit for bryophytes will accelerate characterization of terpenoids biosynthesis and their biological functions in this important lineage of plants.",bryophytes close extant relative ancestral land plant as retained many innovation enabled adaptation early land plant terrestrial environment one important innovation elaboration enormously diverse array secondary metabolite this article review current knowledge terpenoid secondary metabolite constitute largest family plant metabolite bryophyte three perspective chemical diversity biosynthesis biological function the diversity terpenoids bryophyte particularly liverwort enormously rich more terpenoids reported plant group while many terpenoids observed bryophyte seed plant unique bryophyte it beginning u understand molecular biochemical basis underlying terpenoid biosynthesis bryophyte compared seed plant one type terpene synthase gene called typical plant terpene synthase gene bryophyte employ typical plant terpene synthase gene also another class terpene synthase gene called microbial terpene synthase like mtpsl gene terpenoid biosynthesis biochemical study suggest mtpsls largely responsible terpenoid diversity bryophyte particularly sesquiterpenes monoterpenes existing literature indicates terpenoids made bryophyte important function diverse biological ecological process particularly defense biotic abiotic stress the continued development genomic resource molecular tool kit bryophyte accelerate characterization terpenoids biosynthesis biological function important lineage plant,medium
550,An update on the function and regulation of methylerythritol phosphate and mevalonate pathways and their evolutionary dynamics,"Isoprenoids are among the largest and most chemically diverse classes of organic compounds in nature and are involved in the processes of photosynthesis, respiration, growth, development, and plant responses to stress. The basic building block units for isoprenoid synthesis—isopentenyl diphosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate—are generated by the mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. Here, we summarize recent advances on the roles of the MEP and MVA pathways in plant growth, development and stress responses, and attempt to define the underlying gene networks that orchestrate the MEP and MVA pathways in response to developmental or environmental cues. Through phylogenomic analysis, we also provide a new perspective on the evolution of the plant isoprenoid pathway. We conclude that the presence of the MVA pathway in plants may be associated with the transition from aquatic to subaerial and terrestrial environments, as lineages for its core components are absent in green algae. The emergence of the MVA pathway has acted as a key evolutionary event in plants that facilitated land colonization and subsequent embryo development, as well as adaptation to new and varied environments.",isoprenoids among largest chemically diverse class organic compound nature involved process photosynthesis respiration growth development plant response stress the basic building block unit isoprenoid synthesis isopentenyl diphosphate isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate generated mevalonate mva methylerythritol phosphate mep pathway here summarize recent advance role mep mva pathway plant growth development stress response attempt define underlying gene network orchestrate mep mva pathway response developmental environmental cue through phylogenomic analysis also provide new perspective evolution plant isoprenoid pathway we conclude presence mva pathway plant may associated transition aquatic subaerial terrestrial environment lineage core component absent green algae the emergence mva pathway acted key evolutionary event plant facilitated land colonization subsequent embryo development well adaptation new varied environment,medium
551,Biogenic volatile organic compounds in the Earth system,"Biogenic volatile organic compounds produced by plants are involved in plant growth, development, reproduction and defence. They also function as communication media within plant communities, between plants and between plants and insects. Because of the high chemical reactivity of many of these compounds, coupled with their large mass emission rates from vegetation into the atmosphere, they have significant effects on the chemical composition and physical characteristics of the atmosphere. Hence, biogenic volatile organic compounds mediate the relationship between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Alteration of this relationship by anthropogenically driven changes to the environment, including global climate change, may perturb these interactions and may lead to adverse and hard-to-predict consequences for the Earth system.

553,Capturing of the monoterpene olefin limonene produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Monoterpene olefins such as limonene are plant compounds with applications as flavouring and fragrance agents, as solvents and potentially also in polymer and fuel chemistry. We engineered baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to express a (-)-limonene synthase from Perilla frutescens and a (+)-limonene synthase from Citrus limon. Both proteins were expressed either with their native plastid targeting signal or in a truncated form in which the plastidial sorting signal was removed. The yeast host strain for expression was AE9 K197G, which expresses a mutant Erg20 enzyme. This enzyme catalyses the formation of geranyl diphosphate, which is the precursor for monoterpenes. Several methods were tested to capture limonene produced by the yeast. Extraction from the culture medium by pentane, or by the addition of CaCl2 followed by solid-phase micro-extraction, did not lead to detectable limonene, indicating that limonene is rapidly lost from the culture medium. Volatile terpenes such as limonene may also be trapped in a dodecane phase added to the medium during fermentation. This method resulted in recovery of 0.028?mg/l (+)-limonene and 0.060?mg/l (-)-limonene in strains using the truncated Citrus and Perilla synthases, respectively. Trapping the headspace during culture of the limonene synthase-expressing strains resulted in higher titres, at 0.12?mg/l (+)-limonene and 0.49?mg/l (-)-limonene.

554,Carotenoid biosynthesis in plant storage organs: recent advances and prospects for improving plant food quality,"Carotenoids are components of the photosynthetic machinery, intermediates in the biosynthesis of abscisic acid and other apocarotenoids and act as coloured pigments particularly in floral and fruit tissue. Humans benefit in a number of ways from dietary carotenoids present in green leaf tissue and many fruits, seeds, roots and tubers. Carotenoids with a ß-ring end group are required for the synthesis of vitamin A, and deficiency for this vitamin remains a major health problem in some parts of the world. Epidemiological studies suggest that carotenoids also have important roles in a range of diseases including age-related macular degradation and some cancers. The isoprenoid pathway is described, which leads to the carotenoids via the condensation of five-carbon isoprenoid units to form a 40-carbon chain in phytoene. The early part of the biosynthetic pathway involves crosstalk between plastidic and cytosolic components. Desaturation, isomerization, cyclization, hydroxylation and epoxidation of the 40-carbon phytoene gives the range of carotenoids found in plants. The nuclear-encoded enzymes for these stages are targeted to plastids, and in some cases, different members of a gene family are active in plastids in different tissue types. Studies on the transgenic manipulation of the pathway, natural and induced mutants, gene silencing and gene and quantitative trait locus mapping are increasingly unravelling the pathway and its control, giving opportunities for directed manipulation of the types and quantities of these nutritionally important compounds in crop tissues used in human and animal diets.",carotenoids component photosynthetic machinery intermediate biosynthesis abscisic acid apocarotenoids act coloured pigment particularly floral fruit tissue humans benefit number way dietary carotenoid present green leaf tissue many fruit seed root tuber carotenoids ring end group required synthesis vitamin a deficiency vitamin remains major health problem part world epidemiological study suggest carotenoid also important role range disease including age related macular degradation cancer the isoprenoid pathway described lead carotenoid via condensation five carbon isoprenoid unit form carbon chain phytoene the early part biosynthetic pathway involves crosstalk plastidic cytosolic component desaturation isomerization cyclization hydroxylation epoxidation carbon phytoene give range carotenoid found plant the nuclear encoded enzyme stage targeted plastid case different member gene family active plastid different tissue type studies transgenic manipulation pathway natural induced mutant gene silencing gene quantitative trait locus mapping increasingly unravelling pathway control giving opportunity directed manipulation type quantity nutritionally important compound crop tissue used human animal diet,low
555,Chemical convergence between plants and insects: biosynthetic origins and functions of common secondary metabolites,"Despite the phylogenetic distance between plants and insects, these two groups of organisms produce some secondary metabolites in common. Identical structures belonging to chemical classes such as the simple monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, iridoid monoterpenes, cyanogenic glycosides, benzoic acid derivatives, benzoquinones and naphthoquinones are sometimes found in both plants and insects. In addition, very similar glucohydrolases involved in activating two-component defenses, such as glucosinolates and cyanogenic glycosides, occur in both plants and insects. Although this trend was first noted many years ago, researchers have long struggled to find convincing explanations for such co-occurrence. In some cases, identical compounds may be produced by plants to interfere with their function in insects. In others, plant and insect compounds may simply have parallel functions, probably in defense or attraction, and their co-occurrence is a coincidence. The biosynthetic origin of such co-occurring metabolites may be very different in insects as compared to plants. Plants and insects may have different pathways to the same metabolite, or similar sequences of intermediates, but different enzymes. Further knowledge of the ecological roles and biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites may shed more light on why plants and insects produce identical substances.",despite phylogenetic distance plant insect two group organism produce secondary metabolite common identical structure belonging chemical class simple monoterpenes sesquiterpenes iridoid monoterpenes cyanogenic glycoside benzoic acid derivative benzoquinone naphthoquinone sometimes found plant insect in addition similar glucohydrolases involved activating two component defense glucosinolates cyanogenic glycoside occur plant insect although trend first noted many year ago researcher long struggled find convincing explanation co occurrence in case identical compound may produced plant interfere function insect in others plant insect compound may simply parallel function probably defense attraction co occurrence coincidence the biosynthetic origin co occurring metabolite may different insect compared plant plants insect may different pathway metabolite similar sequence intermediate different enzyme further knowledge ecological role biosynthetic pathway secondary metabolite may shed light plant insect produce identical substance,low
556,Determination of specific volatile organic compounds synthesised during Tuber borchiifruit body development by solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry,"Fruit body development is a particular phase of the Tuber life cycle, characterised by the aggregation of different types of hyphae, i.e., vegetative hyphal cells and highly specialised reproductive hyphae (asci). In order to identify the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced in different stages of the Tuber borchii ripening fruit body, solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was used. The volatile organic compounds were extracted using a DVB/CAR/PDMS 50/30?µm fiber placed for 10 min at room temperature in the truffle headspace. The results obtained reveal 49 compounds each of which was present only in a particular stage of maturation. 1-octen-3-ol, aromadendrene, a-farnesene and other terpenoid compounds were of particular interest, and their possible biological roles are discussed. The production of aromadendrene in the completely unripe fruit body suggests the existence of communication events in the early stage of ascomata formation between the fungus and the host plant. a-Farnesene could represent a chemotactic attractant to saprophytic organisms in order to disperse the fungal spores in the environment. The identification of the VOCs produced by truffles during their maturation could give information about the processes underlying this phase of Tuber life cycle.

558,Effect of land-use change and management on biogenic volatile organic compound emissions – selecting climate-smart cultivars,"Land-use change (LUC) has fundamentally altered the form and function of the terrestrial biosphere. Increasing human population, the drive for higher living standards and the potential challenges of mitigating and adapting to global environmental change mean that further changes in LUC are unavoidable. LUC has direct consequences on climate not only via emissions of greenhouse gases and changing the surface energy balance but also by affecting the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Isoprenoids, which dominate global BVOC emissions, are highly reactive and strongly modify atmospheric composition. The effects of LUC on BVOC emissions and related atmospheric chemistry have been largely ignored so far. However, compared with natural ecosystems, most tree species used in bioenergy plantations are strong BVOC emitters, whereas intensively cultivated crops typically emit less BVOCs. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on LUC-driven BVOC emissions and how these might affect atmospheric composition and climate. We further discuss land management and plant-breeding strategies, which could be taken to move towards climate-friendly BVOC emissions while simultaneously maintaining or improving key ecosystem functions such as crop yield under a changing environment.",land use change luc fundamentally altered form function terrestrial biosphere increasing human population drive higher living standard potential challenge mitigating adapting global environmental change mean change luc unavoidable luc direct consequence climate via emission greenhouse gas changing surface energy balance also affecting emission biogenic volatile organic compound bvocs isoprenoids dominate global bvoc emission highly reactive strongly modify atmospheric composition the effect luc bvoc emission related atmospheric chemistry largely ignored far however compared natural ecosystem tree specie used bioenergy plantation strong bvoc emitter whereas intensively cultivated crop typically emit le bvocs here summarize current knowledge luc driven bvoc emission might affect atmospheric composition climate we discus land management plant breeding strategy could taken move towards climate friendly bvoc emission simultaneously maintaining improving key ecosystem function crop yield changing environment,low
559,Emissions of volatile organic compounds from vegetation and the implications for atmospheric chemistry,"Vegetation provides a major source of reactive carbon entering the atmosphere. These compounds play an important role in (1) shaping global tropospheric chemistry, (2) regional photochemical oxidant formation, (3) balancing the global carbon cycle, and (4) production of organic acids which contribute to acidic deposition in rural areas. Present estimates place the total annual global emission of these compounds between approximately 500 and 825 Tg yr-1. The volatile olefinic compounds, such as isoprene and the monoterpenes, are thought to constitute the bulk of these emissions. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that a variety of partially oxidized hydrocarbons, principally alcohols, are also emitted. The available information concerning the terrestrial vegetation as sources of volatile organic compounds is reviewed. The biochemical processes associated with these emissions of the compounds and the atmospheric chemistry of the emitted compounds are discussed.",vegetation provides major source reactive carbon entering atmosphere these compound play important role shaping global tropospheric chemistry regional photochemical oxidant formation balancing global carbon cycle production organic acid contribute acidic deposition rural area present estimate place total annual global emission compound approximately tg yr the volatile olefinic compound isoprene monoterpenes thought constitute bulk emission however becoming increasingly clear variety partially oxidized hydrocarbon principally alcohol also emitted the available information concerning terrestrial vegetation source volatile organic compound reviewed the biochemical process associated emission compound atmospheric chemistry emitted compound discussed,low

562,Enhancing epi -cedrol production in Escherichia coliby fusion expression of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase and epi -cedrol synthase,"Terpene synthase catalyses acyclic diphosphate farnesyl diphosphate into desired sesquiterpenes. In this study, a fusion enzyme was constructed by linking Santalum album farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (SaFPPS) individually with terpene synthase and Artemisia annua Epi-cedrol synthase (AaECS). The stop codon at the N-terminus of SaFPPS was removed and replaced by a short peptide (GSGGS) to introduce a linker between the two open reading frames. This fusion clone was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosseta DE3 cells. The fusion enzyme FPPS-ECS produced sesquiterpene 8-epi-cedrol from substrates isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate through sequential reactions. The Km values for FPPS-ECS for isopentyl diphosphate was 4.71 µM. The fusion enzyme carried out the efficient conversion of IPP to epi-cedrol, in comparison to single enzymes SaFPPS and AaECS when combined together in enzyme assay over time. Further, the recombinant E. coli BL21 strain harbouring fusion plasmid successfully produced epi-cedrol in fermentation medium. The strain having fusion plasmid (pET32a-FPPS-ECS) produced 1.084 ± 0.09 mg/L epi-cedrol, while the strain harbouring mixed plasmid (pRSETB-FPPS and pET28a-ECS) showed 1.002 ± 0.07 mg/L titre in fermentation medium by overexpression and MEP pathway utilization.

563,Evolution of TPS20-related terpene synthases influences chemical diversity in the glandular trichomes of the wild tomato relative Solanum habrochaites,"A systematic screen of volatile terpene production in the glandular trichomes of 79 accessions of Solanum habrochaites was conducted and revealed the presence of 21 mono- and sesquiterpenes that exhibit a range of qualitative and quantitative variation. Hierarchical clustering identified distinct terpene phenotypic modules with shared patterns of terpene accumulation across accessions. Several terpene modules could be assigned to previously identified terpene synthase (TPS) activities that included members of the TPS-e/f subfamily that utilize the unusual cis-prenyl diphosphate substrates neryl diphosphate and 2z,6z-farnesyl diphosphate. DNA sequencing and in vitro enzyme activity analysis of TPS-e/f members from S. habrochaites identified three previously unassigned enzyme activities that utilize these cisoid substrates. These produce either the monoterpenes a-pinene and limonene, or the sesquiterpene 7-epizingiberene, with the in vitro analyses that recapitulated the trichome chemistry found in planta. Comparison of the distribution of S. habrochaites accessions with terpene content revealed a strong preference for the presence of particular TPS20 alleles at distinct geographic locations.

565,Farnesol production from Escherichia coliby harnessing the exogenous mevalonate pathway,"Farnesol (FOH) production has been carried out in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. FOH is formed through the depyrophosphorylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which is synthesized from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) by FPP synthase. In order to increase FPP synthesis, E. coli was metabolically engineered to overexpress ispA and to utilize the foreign mevalonate (MVA) pathway for the efficient synthesis of IPP and DMAPP. Two-phase culture using a decane overlay of the culture broth was applied to reduce volatile loss of FOH produced during culture and to extract FOH from the culture broth. A FOH production of 135.5?mg/L was obtained from the recombinant E. coli harboring the pTispA and pSNA plasmids for ispA overexpression and MVA pathway utilization, respectively. It is interesting to observe that a large amount of FOH could be produced from E. coli without FOH synthase by the augmentation of FPP synthesis. Introduction of the exogenous MVA pathway enabled the dramatic production of FOH by E. coli while no detectable FOH production was observed in the endogenous MEP pathway-only control. Biotechnol.

566,Floral volatiles: from biosynthesis to function,"Floral volatiles have attracted humans' attention since antiquity and have since then permeated many aspects of our lives. Indeed, they are heavily used in perfumes, cosmetics, flavourings and medicinal applications. However, their primary function is to mediate ecological interactions between flowers and a diverse array of visitors, including pollinators, florivores and pathogens. As such, they ultimately ensure the plants' reproductive and evolutionary success. To date, over 1700 floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been identified. Interestingly, they are derived from only a few biochemical networks, which include the terpenoid, phenylpropanoid/benzenoid and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. These pathways are intricately regulated by endogenous and external factors to enable spatially and temporally controlled emission of floral volatiles, thereby fine-tuning the ecological interactions facilitated by floral volatiles. In this review, we will focus on describing the biosynthetic pathways leading to floral VOCs, the regulation of floral volatile emission, as well as biological functions of emitted volatiles.",floral volatile attracted human attention since antiquity since permeated many aspect life indeed heavily used perfume cosmetic flavouring medicinal application however primary function mediate ecological interaction flower diverse array visitor including pollinator florivores pathogen as ultimately ensure plant reproductive evolutionary success to date floral volatile organic compound vocs identified interestingly derived biochemical network include terpenoid phenylpropanoid benzenoid fatty acid biosynthetic pathway these pathway intricately regulated endogenous external factor enable spatially temporally controlled emission floral volatile thereby fine tuning ecological interaction facilitated floral volatile in review focus describing biosynthetic pathway leading floral vocs regulation floral volatile emission well biological function emitted volatile,medium
567,Fueling the future with biomass: Processes and pathways for a sustainable supply of hydrocarbon fuels and biogas,"Global economic growth, wealth and security rely upon the availability of cheap, mostly fossil-derived energy and chemical compounds. The replacement by sustainable resources is widely discussed. However, the current state of biotechnological processes usually restricts them to be used as a true alternative in terms of economic feasibility and even sustainability. Among the rare examples of bioprocesses applied for the energetic use of biomass are biogas and bioethanol production. Usually, these processes lack in efficiency and they cannot be operated without the support of legislation. Although they represent a first step towards a greater share of bio-based processes for energy provision, there is no doubt that tremendous improvements in strain and process development, feedstock and process flexibility as well as in the integration of these processes into broader supply and production networks, in this review called smart bioproduction grids, are required to make them economically attractive, robust enough, and wider acceptance by society. All this requires an interdisciplinary approach, which includes the use of residues in closed carbon cycles and issues concerning the process safety.

568,Genetic control of a-farnesene production in apple fruit and its role in fungal pathogenesis,"Terpenes are important compounds in plant trophic interactions. A meta-analysis of GC-MS data from a diverse range of apple (Malus × domestica) genotypes revealed that apple fruit produces a range of terpene volatiles, with the predominant terpene being the acyclic branched sesquiterpene (E,E)-a-farnesene. Four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for a-farnesene production in ripe fruit were identified in a segregating ‘Royal Gala’ (RG) × ‘Granny Smith’ (GS) population with one major QTL on linkage group 10 co-locating with the MdAFS1 (a-farnesene synthase-1) gene. Three of the four QTLs were derived from the GS parent, which was consistent with GC-MS analysis of headspace and solvent-extracted terpenes showing that cold-treated GS apples produced higher levels of (E,E)-a-farnesene than RG. Transgenic RG fruit downregulated for MdAFS1 expression produced significantly lower levels of (E,E)-a-farnesene. To evaluate the role of (E,E)-a-farnesene in fungal pathogenesis, MdAFS1 RNA interference transgenic fruit and RG controls were inoculated with three important apple post-harvest pathogens [Colletotrichum acutatum, Penicillium expansum and Neofabraea alba (synonym Phlyctema vagabunda)]. From results obtained over four seasons, we demonstrate that reduced (E,E)-a-farnesene is associated with decreased disease initiation rates of all three pathogens. In each case, the infection rate was significantly reduced 7 days post-inoculation, although the size of successful lesions was comparable with infections on control fruit.

569,Herbivore-induced and constitutive volatiles are controlled by different oxylipin-dependent mechanisms in rice,"Despite the importance of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for plants, control mechanisms for their basal and stress-induced biosynthesis and release remain unclear. We sampled and characterized headspace and internal leaf volatile pools in rice (Oryza sativa), after a simulated herbivory treatment, which triggers an endogenous jasmonate burst. Certain volatiles, such as linalool, were strongly upregulated by simulated herbivory stress. In contrast, other volatiles, such as ß-caryophyllene, were constitutively emitted and fluctuated according to time of day. Transcripts of the linalool synthase gene transiently increased 1–3 h after exposure of rice to simulated herbivory, whereas transcripts of caryophyllene synthase peaked independently at dawn. Unexpectedly, although emission and accumulation patterns of rice inducible and constitutive VOCs were substantially different, both groups of volatiles were compromised in jasmonate-deficient hebiba mutants, which lack the allene oxide cyclase (AOC) gene. This suggests that rice employs at least two distinct oxylipin-dependent mechanisms downstream of AOC to control production of constitutive and herbivore-induced volatiles. Levels of the JA precursor, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), were correlated with constitutive volatile levels suggesting that OPDA or its derivatives could be involved in control of volatile emission in rice.",despite importance volatile organic compound vocs plant control mechanism basal stress induced biosynthesis release remain unclear we sampled characterized headspace internal leaf volatile pool rice oryza sativa simulated herbivory treatment trigger endogenous jasmonate burst certain volatile linalool strongly upregulated simulated herbivory stress in contrast volatile caryophyllene constitutively emitted fluctuated according time day transcripts linalool synthase gene transiently increased h exposure rice simulated herbivory whereas transcript caryophyllene synthase peaked independently dawn unexpectedly although emission accumulation pattern rice inducible constitutive vocs substantially different group volatile compromised jasmonate deficient hebiba mutant lack allene oxide cyclase aoc gene this suggests rice employ least two distinct oxylipin dependent mechanism downstream aoc control production constitutive herbivore induced volatile levels ja precursor oxo phytodienoic acid opda correlated constitutive volatile level suggesting opda derivative could involved control volatile emission rice,low
570,"High-level production of amorpha-4,11-diene in a two-phase partitioning bioreactor of metabolically engineered Escherichia coli","Reconstructing synthetic metabolic pathways in microbes holds great promise for the production of pharmaceuticals in large-scale fermentations. By recreating biosynthetic pathways in bacteria, complex molecules traditionally harvested from scarce natural resources can be produced in microbial cultures. Here we report on a strain of Escherichia coli containing a heterologous, nine-gene biosynthetic pathway for the production of the terpene amorpha-4,11-diene, a precursor to the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. Previous reports have underestimated the productivity of this strain due to the volatility of amorphadiene. Here we show that amorphadiene evaporates from a fermentor with a half-life of about 50 min. Using a condenser, we take advantage of this volatility by trapping the amorphadiene in the off-gas. Amorphadiene was positively identified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and determined to be 89% pure as collected. We captured amorphadiene as it was produced in situ by employing a two-phase partitioning bioreactor with a dodecane organic phase. Using a previously characterized caryophyllene standard to calibrate amorphadiene production and capture, the concentration of amorphadiene produced was determined to be 0.5 g/L of culture medium. A standard of amorphadiene collected from the off-gas showed that the caryophyllene standard overestimated amorphadiene production by approximately 30%. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",reconstructing synthetic metabolic pathway microbe hold great promise production pharmaceutical large scale fermentation by recreating biosynthetic pathway bacteria complex molecule traditionally harvested scarce natural resource produced microbial culture here report strain escherichia coli containing heterologous nine gene biosynthetic pathway production terpene amorpha diene precursor anti malarial drug artemisinin previous report underestimated productivity strain due volatility amorphadiene here show amorphadiene evaporates fermentor half life min using condenser take advantage volatility trapping amorphadiene gas amorphadiene positively identified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy determined pure collected we captured amorphadiene produced situ employing two phase partitioning bioreactor dodecane organic phase using previously characterized caryophyllene standard calibrate amorphadiene production capture concentration amorphadiene produced determined g l culture medium a standard amorphadiene collected gas showed caryophyllene standard overestimated amorphadiene production approximately wiley periodicals inc,high
571,IdsA is the major geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase involved in carotenogenesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum,"Corynebacterium glutamicum, a yellow-pigmented soil bacterium that synthesizes the rare cyclic C50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin and its glucosides, has been engineered for the production of various carotenoids. CrtE was assumed to be the major geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase in carotenogenesis; however, deletion of crtE did not abrogate carotenoid synthesis. In silico analysis of the repertoire of prenyltransferases encoded by the C. glutamicum genome revealed two candidate GGPPS genes (idsA and ispB). The absence of pigmentation of an idsA deletion mutant and complementation experiments with a double deletion mutant lacking both idsA and crtE showed that IdsA is the major GGPPS of C. glutamicum and that crtE overexpression compensated for the lack of IdsA, whereas plasmid-borne overexpression of ispB did not. Purified His-tagged CrtE was active as a homodimer, whereas the active form of IdsA was homotetrameric. Both enzymes catalyzed prenyl transfer with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesylphosphate (FPP) as substrates. IdsA showed the highest catalytic efficiency with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and IPP, whereas the catalytic efficiency of CrtE was highest with geranyl pyrophosphate and IPP.

The non-volatile glycosylated group is the largest, and it is present in all varieties of Vitis vinifera (L.), the most widely used species for wine production. These aroma precursors represent the reserve of aroma molecules that can be released during winemaking. Their relative and absolute concentrations at fruit ripening determine the organoleptic value of the final product. A large range of biotic and abiotic factors can influence their biosynthesis in several ways. Agronomic practices such as irrigation, training systems, leaf removal, and bunch thinning can have an effect at plant level. The spraying of stimulatory compounds on fruit at different developmental stages has also been shown to modify metabolic pathways at fruit level with some impact on the aroma composition of the grapevine fruit. Viticulturists could act to promote aroma precursors to improve the aromatic profile of grapes and the wine ultimately produced. However, agronomic practices do not always have uniform results. The metabolic and physiological changes resulting from agronomic practices are unknown because there has not been sufficient research to date. This review presents the state of the art regarding the influences of vineyard agronomic management on the biosynthesis of grape aroma compounds. Although literature regarding the topic is abundant there are still many unknown biological mechanisms involved and/or that have been insufficiently studied. The aim of this work is therefore to find the gaps in scientific literature so that future investigations can focus on them. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry",aroma compound secondary metabolite play key role grape quality enological purpose terpenes c norisoprenoids phenol non terpenic alcohol important aroma compound grape found free volatile glycoconjugated bound molecule the non volatile glycosylated group largest present variety vitis vinifera l widely used specie wine production these aroma precursor represent reserve aroma molecule released winemaking their relative absolute concentration fruit ripening determine organoleptic value final product a large range biotic abiotic factor influence biosynthesis several way agronomic practice irrigation training system leaf removal bunch thinning effect plant level the spraying stimulatory compound fruit different developmental stage also shown modify metabolic pathway fruit level impact aroma composition grapevine fruit viticulturists could act promote aroma precursor improve aromatic profile grape wine ultimately produced however agronomic practice always uniform result the metabolic physiological change resulting agronomic practice unknown sufficient research date this review present state art regarding influence vineyard agronomic management biosynthesis grape aroma compound although literature regarding topic abundant still many unknown biological mechanism involved insufficiently studied the aim work therefore find gap scientific literature future investigation focus society chemical industry,high
573,Isoprenoids: Remarkable diversity of form and function,"The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is the source of a wide array of products. The pathway has been highly conserved throughout evolution, and isoprenoids are some of the most ancient biomolecules ever identified, playing key roles in many life forms. In this review we focus on C-10 mono-, C-15 sesqui-, and C-20 diterpenes. Evidence for interconversion between the pathway intermediates farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranly pyrophosphate and their respective metabolites is examined. The diverse functions of these molecules are discussed in detail, including their ability to regulate expression of the ß-HMG-CoA reductase and Ras-related proteins. Additional topics include the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic effects of select isoprenoids, antiulcer activities, and the disposition and degradation of isoprenoids in the environment. Finally, the significance of pharmacological manipulation of the isoprenoid pathway and clinical correlations are discussed.",the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway source wide array product the pathway highly conserved throughout evolution isoprenoids ancient biomolecules ever identified playing key role many life form in review focus c mono c sesqui c diterpenes evidence interconversion pathway intermediate farnesyl pyrophosphate geranylgeranly pyrophosphate respective metabolite examined the diverse function molecule discussed detail including ability regulate expression hmg coa reductase ras related protein additional topic include mechanism underlying apoptotic effect select isoprenoids antiulcer activity disposition degradation isoprenoids environment finally significance pharmacological manipulation isoprenoid pathway clinical correlation discussed,medium
574,Lepidopteran herbivory and oral factors induce transcripts encoding novel terpene synthases in Medicago truncatula†,"Terpenes are an important class of defense compounds that accumulate in plants after pathogen infection or arthropod injury. Sequences predicted to encode terpene synthases were selected from an expressed sequence tag (EST) database of Medicago truncatula. Four putative terpene synthase clones (MtTps1–MtTps4), originating from a chewing insect-damaged M. truncatula leaf cDNA library, were isolated. Transcript levels of each gene examined increased in response to artificial wounding, Spodoptera exigua herbivory, and treatment with volatile methyl jasmonate (meJA). Addition of S. exigua regurgitant to wound sites triggered transcript accumulation of MtTps1 and levels increased with higher concentrations of regurgitant. Furthermore, induction of MtTps1 occurred after application of N-linolenoyl-glutamate or N-linoleoyl-glutamate, factors found in lepidopteran regurgitant. Genomic DNA blots indicate that each of the putative proteins is encoded by a single-copy gene or a small gene family. Proteins encoded by MtTps3 and MtTps4 are imported into the soluble fraction of chloroplasts in in vitro assays, whereas proteins encoded by MtTps1 and MtTps2 are not imported into chloroplasts. Combined with sequence comparisons of multiple plant terpene synthases, the import data indicate that MtTps1 and MtTps2 likely encode sesquiterpene synthases and that MtTps3 and MtTps4 encode mono- or di-terpene synthases. In addition to serving as a valuable model legume species for genomic studies, M. truncatula should prove a valuable source of novel terpene-producing enzymes. Induction of wound-responsive genes by insect oral factors suggests that M. truncatula senses biotic damage through the presence of elicitors originating in the herbivore. Arch. Insect Biochem.

575,Metabolic engineering of aroma components in fruits,"Plants have the ability to produce a diversity of volatile metabolites, which attract pollinators and seed dispersers and strengthen plant defense responses. Selection by plant breeders of traits such as rapid growth and yield leads, in many cases, to the loss of flavor and aroma quality in crops. How the aroma can be improved without affecting other fruit attributes is a major unsolved issue. Significant advances in metabolic engineering directed at improving the set of volatiles that the fruits emit has been aided by the characterization of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of flavor and aroma compounds in some fruits. However, before this technology can be successfully applied to modulate the production of volatiles in different crops, further basic research is needed on the mechanisms that lead to the production of these compounds in plants. Here we review the biosynthesis and function of volatile compounds in plants, and the attempts that have been made to manipulate fruit aroma biosynthesis by metabolic engineering. In addition, we discuss the possibilities that molecular breeding offers for aroma enhancement and the implications of the latest advances in biotechnological modification of fruit flavor and aroma.",plants ability produce diversity volatile metabolite attract pollinator seed dispersers strengthen plant defense response selection plant breeder trait rapid growth yield lead many case loss flavor aroma quality crop how aroma improved without affecting fruit attribute major unsolved issue significant advance metabolic engineering directed improving set volatile fruit emit aided characterization enzyme involved biosynthesis flavor aroma compound fruit however technology successfully applied modulate production volatile different crop basic research needed mechanism lead production compound plant here review biosynthesis function volatile compound plant attempt made manipulate fruit aroma biosynthesis metabolic engineering in addition discus possibility molecular breeding offer aroma enhancement implication latest advance biotechnological modification fruit flavor aroma,high
576,"Metabolic engineering of plant monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes—current status and future opportunities","Terpenoids (a.k.a. isoprenoids) represent the most diverse class of natural products found in plants, with tens of thousands of reported structures. Plant-derived terpenoids have a multitude of pharmaceutical and industrial applications, but the natural resources for their extraction are often limited and, in many cases, synthetic routes are not commercially viable. Some of the most valuable terpenoids are not accumulated in model plants or crops, and genetic resources for breeding of terpenoid natural product traits are thus poorly developed. At present, metabolic engineering, either in the native producer or a heterologous host, is the only realistic alternative to improve yield and accessibility. In this review article, we will evaluate the state of the art of modulating the biosynthetic pathways for the production of mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes in plants.",terpenoids k isoprenoids represent diverse class natural product found plant ten thousand reported structure plant derived terpenoids multitude pharmaceutical industrial application natural resource extraction often limited many case synthetic route commercially viable some valuable terpenoids accumulated model plant crop genetic resource breeding terpenoid natural product trait thus poorly developed at present metabolic engineering either native producer heterologous host realistic alternative improve yield accessibility in review article evaluate state art modulating biosynthetic pathway production mono sesqui diterpenes plant,high
577,Metabolic Engineering of Plant-derived (E )-ß-farnesene Synthase Genes for a Novel Type of Aphid-resistant Genetically Modified Crop Plants†,"Aphids are major agricultural pests that cause significant yield losses of crop plants each year. Excessive dependence on insecticides for long-term aphid control is undesirable because of the development of insecticide resistance, the potential negative effects on non-target organisms and environmental pollution. Transgenic crops engineered for resistance to aphids via a non-toxic mode of action could be an efficient alternative strategy. (E)-ß-Farnesene (EßF) synthases catalyze the formation of EßF, which for many pest aphids is the main component of the alarm pheromone involved in the chemical communication within these species. EßF can also be synthesized by certain plants but is then normally contaminated with inhibitory compounds. Engineering of crop plants capable of synthesizing and emitting EßF could cause repulsion of aphids and also the attraction of natural enemies that use EßF as a foraging cue, thus minimizing aphid infestation. In this review, the effects of aphids on host plants, plants’ defenses against aphid herbivory and the recruitment of natural enemies for aphid control in an agricultural setting are briefly introduced. Furthermore, the plant-derived EßF synthase genes cloned to date along with their potential roles in generating novel aphid resistance via genetically modified approaches are discussed.",aphids major agricultural pest cause significant yield loss crop plant year excessive dependence insecticide long term aphid control undesirable development insecticide resistance potential negative effect non target organism environmental pollution transgenic crop engineered resistance aphid via non toxic mode action could efficient alternative strategy e farnesene e f synthases catalyze formation e f many pest aphid main component alarm pheromone involved chemical communication within specie e f also synthesized certain plant normally contaminated inhibitory compound engineering crop plant capable synthesizing emitting e f could cause repulsion aphid also attraction natural enemy use e f foraging cue thus minimizing aphid infestation in review effect aphid host plant plant defense aphid herbivory recruitment natural enemy aphid control agricultural setting briefly introduced furthermore plant derived e f synthase gene cloned date along potential role generating novel aphid resistance via genetically modified approach discussed,low
