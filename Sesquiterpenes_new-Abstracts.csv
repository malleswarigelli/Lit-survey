Title,Abstract
"‘Hidden’ Terpenoids in Plants: Their Biosynthesis, Localization and Ecological Roles","Terpenoids are the largest group of plant specialized (secondary) metabolites. These naturally occurring chemical compounds are highly diverse in chemical structure. Although there have been many excellent studies of terpenoids, most have focused on compounds built solely of isoprene units. Plants, however, also contain many ‘atypical’ terpenoids, such as glycosylated volatile terpenes and composite-type terpenoids, the latter of which are synthesized by the coupling of isoprene units on aromatic compounds. This mini review describes these ‘hidden’ terpenoids, providing an overview of their biosynthesis, localization, and biological and ecological activities."
A modern purification method for volatile sesquiterpenes produced by recombinant Escherichia coli carrying terpene synthase genes,"Most volatile sesquiterpenes had been purified from plants using distillation and preparative gas chromatography, which is not applicable to many laboratories that do not possess a needed facility. Thus, this review focuses on a modern purification method for volatile sesquiterpenes using Escherichia coli cells that functionally express terpene synthase (Tps) genes. It was recently developed that recombinant E. coli cells carrying Tps genes were cultured in two-layer media (n-octane/TB medium) without harming the cells, and the volatile hydrophobic compounds trapped in the n-octane were purified by two-phase partition (alkane/alkaline 50% MeOH), silica gel column chromatography, and reversed-phase preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (if necessary). Consequently, it was found that the volatile sesquiterpenes are easily purified, the structures of which can then be determined by nuclear magnetic resonance, [a]D and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses. The antioxidant activities of several volatile sesquiterpenes are also presented in this review."
"A Novel Pathway for Sesquiterpene Biosynthesis from Z,Z-Farnesyl Pyrophosphate in the Wild Tomato Solanum habrochaites  ","In the wild tomato Solanum habrochaites, the Sst2 locus on chromosome 8 is responsible for the biosynthesis of several class II sesquiterpene olefins by glandular trichomes. Analysis of a trichome-specific EST collection from S. habrochaites revealed two candidate genes for the synthesis of Sst2-associated sesquiterpenes. zFPS encodes a protein with homology to Z-isoprenyl pyrophosphate synthases and SBS (for Santalene and Bergamotene Synthase) encodes a terpene synthase with homology to kaurene synthases. Both genes were found to cosegregate with the Sst2 locus. Recombinant zFPS protein catalyzed the synthesis of Z,Z-FPP from isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP), while coincubation of zFPS and SBS with the same substrates yielded a mixture of olefins identical to the Sst2-associated sesquiterpenes, including (+)-a-santalene, (+)-endo-ß-bergamotene, and (-)-endo-a-bergamotene. In addition, headspace analysis of tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris) plants expressing zFPS and SBS in glandular trichomes afforded the same mix of sesquiterpenes. Each of these proteins contains a putative plastid targeting sequence that mediates transport of a fused green fluorescent protein to the chloroplasts, suggesting that the biosynthesis of these sesquiterpenes uses IPP and DMAPP from the plastidic DXP pathway. These results provide novel insights into sesquiterpene biosynthesis and have general implications concerning sesquiterpene engineering in plants."
"A Promiscuous CYP706A3 Reduces Terpene Volatile Emission from Arabidopsis Flowers, Affecting Florivores and the Floral Microbiome","Flowers are essential but vulnerable plant organs, exposed to pollinators and florivores; however, flower chemical defenses are rarely investigated. We show here that two clustered terpene synthase and cytochrome P450 encoding genes (TPS11 and CYP706A3) on chromosome 5 of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) are tightly coexpressed in floral tissues, upon anthesis and during floral bud development. TPS11 was previously reported to generate a blend of sesquiterpenes. By heterologous coexpression of TPS11 and CYP706A3 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Nicotiana benthamiana, we demonstrate that CYP706A3 is active on TPS11 products and also further oxidizes its own primary oxidation products. Analysis of headspace and soluble metabolites in cyp706a3 and 35S:CYP706A3 mutants indicate that CYP706A3-mediated metabolism largely suppresses sesquiterpene and most monoterpene emissions from opening flowers, and generates terpene oxides that are retained in floral tissues. In flower buds, the combined expression of TPS11 and CYP706A3 also suppresses volatile emissions and generates soluble sesquiterpene oxides. Florivory assays with the Brassicaceae specialist Plutella xylostella demonstrate that insect larvae avoid feeding on buds expressing CYP706A3 and accumulating terpene oxides. Composition of the floral microbiome appears also to be modulated by CYP706A3 expression. TPS11 and CYP706A3 simultaneously evolved within Brassicaceae and form the most versatile functional gene cluster described in higher plants so far."
Antisense Suppression of a (+)-d-Cadinene Synthase Gene in Cotton Prevents the Induction of This Defense Response Gene during Bacterial Blight Infection But Not Its Constitutive Expression  ,"In cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) the enzyme (+)-d-cadinene synthase (CDNS) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of cadinane-type sesquiterpenes, such as gossypol, that provide constitutive and inducible protection against pests and diseases. A cotton cDNA clone encoding CDNS (cdn1-C4) was isolated from developing embryos and functionally characterized. Southern analysis showed that CDNS genes belong to a large multigene family, of which five genomic clones were studied, including three pseudogenes and one gene that may represent another subfamily of CDNS. CDNS expression was shown to be induced in cotton infected with either the bacterial blight or verticillium wilt pathogens. Constructs for the constitutive or seed-specific antisense suppression of cdn1-C4 were introduced into cotton by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Gossypol levels were not reduced in the seeds of transformants with either construct, nor was the induction of CDNS expression affected in stems of the constitutive antisense plants infected with Verticillium dahliae Kleb. However, the induction of CDNS mRNA and protein in response to bacterial blight infection of cotyledons was completely blocked in the constitutive antisense plants. These results suggest that cdn1-C4 may be involved specifically in the bacterial blight response and that the CDNS multigene family comprises a complex set of genes differing in their temporal and spatial regulation and responsible for different branches of the cotton sesquiterpene pathway."
Aphid-repellent pheromone E-ß-farnesene is generated in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana over-expressing farnesyl diphosphate synthase2,"Background and Aims Plant-synthesized sesquiterpenes play a pivotal role in chemotactic interactions with insects. Biosynthesis of functionally diverse sesquiterpenes is dependent on the availability of a pool of the precursor farnesyldiphosphate (FDP). In Arabidopsis thaliana, FPS2, encoding cytosolic farnesyldiphosphate synthase, is implicated in the synthesis of cytosolic FDP, but it is not known whether enhanced levels of FDP have a commensurate effect on sesquiterpene-mediated defence responses. This study examined transgenic arabidopsis plants generated to over-express FPS2 in order to determine if any effects could be observed in the response of aphids, Myzus persicae."
"Biosynthesis and Emission of Terpenoid Volatiles from Arabidopsis Flowers ","Arabidopsis is believed to be mostly self-pollinated, although several lines of genetic and morphological evidence indicate that insect-mediated outcrossing occurs with at least a low frequency in wild populations. Here, we show that Arabidopsis flowers emit both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, potential olfactory cues for pollinating insects. Of the 32 terpene synthase genes in the Arabidopsis genome, 20 were found to be expressed in flowers, 6 of these exclusively or almost exclusively so. Two terpene synthase genes expressed exclusively in the flowers and one terpene synthase gene expressed almost exclusively in the flowers were characterized and found to encode proteins that catalyze the formation of major floral volatiles. A ß-glucuronidase fusion construct with a promoter of one of these genes demonstrated that gene expression was restricted to the sepals, stigmas, anther filaments, and receptacles, reaching a peak when the stigma was receptive to cross pollen. The observation that Arabidopsis flowers synthesize and emit volatiles raises intriguing questions about the reproductive behavior of Arabidopsis in the wild and allows detailed investigations of floral volatile biosynthesis and its regulation to be performed with this model plant system."
Biosynthetic Pathway of Insect Juvenile Hormone III in Cell Suspension Cultures of the Sedge Cyperus iria  ,"In most insect species, juvenile hormones regulate critical physiological processes such as metamorphosis and reproduction. In insects, these sesquiterpenoids are synthesized by retrocerebral endocrine organs, the corpora allata, via the classical mevalonate (MVA) pathway. One of these compounds, juvenile hormone III (JH III), has also been identified in the sedge Cyperus iria. In higher plants, biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid backbone may proceed through two distinct pathways: the MVA pathway or the 2C-methyl erythritol 4-phosphate pathway or through a combination of both pathways. Cell suspension cultures of C. iria were used to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of JH III in the plant. Enzyme inhibition and labeling studies conclusively demonstrated that the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid backbone of JH III proceeds via the MVA pathway. Inhibitor and precursor feeding studies also suggest that later steps of JH III biosynthesis inC. iria are similar to the insect pathway and that the final enzymatic reaction in JH III biosynthesis is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase."
Bisphosphonate Inhibitors Reveal a Large Elasticity of Plastidic Isoprenoid Synthesis Pathway in Isoprene-Emitting Hybrid Aspen,"Recently, a feedback inhibition of the chloroplastic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP)/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid synthesis by end products dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IDP) was postulated, but the extent to which DMADP and IDP can build up is not known. We used bisphosphonate inhibitors, alendronate and zoledronate, that inhibit the consumption of DMADP and IDP by prenyltransferases to gain insight into the extent of end product accumulation and possible feedback inhibition in isoprene-emitting hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides). A kinetic method based on dark release of isoprene emission at the expense of substrate pools accumulated in light was used to estimate the in vivo pool sizes of DMADP and upstream metabolites. Feeding with fosmidomycin, an inhibitor of DXP reductoisomerase, alone or in combination with bisphosphonates was used to inhibit carbon input into DXP/MEP pathway or both input and output. We observed a major increase in pathway intermediates, 3- to 4-fold, upstream of DMADP in bisphosphonate-inhibited leaves, but the DMADP pool was enhanced much less, 1.3- to 1.5-fold. In combined fosmidomycin/bisphosphonate treatment, pathway intermediates accumulated, reflecting cytosolic flux of intermediates that can be important under strong metabolic pull in physiological conditions. The data suggested that metabolites accumulated upstream of DMADP consist of phosphorylated intermediates and IDP. Slow conversion of the huge pools of intermediates to DMADP was limited by reductive energy supply. These data indicate that the DXP/MEP pathway is extremely elastic, and the presence of a significant pool of phosphorylated intermediates provides an important valve for fine tuning the pathway flux."
Can forest trees compensate for stress-generated growth losses by induced production of volatile compounds?,"Plants produce a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Under abiotic and biotic stresses, the number and amount of produced compounds can increase. Due to their long life span and large size, trees can produce biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) in much higher amounts than many other plants. It has been suggested that at cellular and tree physiological levels, induced production of VOCs is aimed at improving plant resistance to damage by reactive oxygen species generated by multiple abiotic stresses. In the few reported cases when biosynthesis of plant volatiles is inhibited or enhanced, the observed response to stress can be attributed to plant volatiles. Reported increase, e.g., in photosynthesis has mostly ranged between 5 and 50%. A comprehensive model to explain similar induction of VOCs under multiple biotic stresses is not yet available. As a result of pathogen or herbivore attack on forest trees, the induced production of VOCs is localized to the damage site but systemic induction of emissions has also been detected. These volatiles can affect fungal pathogens and the arrival rate of herbivorous insects on damaged trees, but also act as signalling compounds to maintain the trophic cascades that may improve tree fitness by improved efficiency of herbivore natural enemies. On the forest scale, biotic induction of VOC synthesis and release leads to an amplified flow of BVOCs in atmospheric reactions, which in atmospheres rich in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) results in ozone formation, and in low NOx atmospheres results in oxidation of VOCs, removal in ozone from the troposphere and the resulting formation of biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles. I will summarize recent advances in the understanding of stress-induced VOC emissions from trees, with special focus on Populus spp. Particular importance is given to the ecological and atmospheric feedback systems based on BVOCs and biogenic SOA formation."
"Characterization of a Root-Specific Arabidopsis Terpene Synthase Responsible for the Formation of the Volatile Monoterpene 1,8-Cineole","Arabidopsis is emerging as a model system to study the biochemistry, biological functions, and evolution of plant terpene secondary metabolism. It was previously shown that the Arabidopsis genome contains over 30 genes potentially encoding terpene synthases (TPSs). Here we report the characterization of a monoterpene synthase encoded by two identical, closely linked genes, At3g25820 and At3g25830. Transcripts of these genes were detected almost exclusively in roots. An At3g25820/At3g25830 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein thus produced was shown to catalyze the formation of 10 volatile monoterpenes from geranyl diphosphate, with 1,8-cineole predominating. This protein was therefore designated AtTPS-Cin. The purified recombinant AtTPS-Cin displayed similar biochemical properties to other known monoterpene synthases, except for a relatively low K  m value for geranyl diphosphate of 0.2 µ  M. At3g25820/At3g25830 promoter activity, measured with a ß-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, was primarily found in the epidermis, cortex, and stele of mature primary and lateral roots, but not in the root meristem or the elongation zone. Although the products of AtTPS-Cin were not detected by direct extraction of plant tissue, the recent report of 1,8-cineole as an Arabidopsis root volatile (Steeghs M, Bais HP, de Gouw J, Goldan P, Kuster W, Northway M, Fall R, Vivanco JM [2004] Plant Physiol 135: 47–58) suggests that the enzyme products may be released into the rhizosphere rather than accumulated. Among Arabidopsis TPSs, AtTPS-Cin is most similar to the TPS encoded by At3g25810, a closely linked gene previously shown to be exclusively expressed in flowers. At3g25810 TPS catalyzes the formation of a set of monoterpenes that is very similar to those produced by AtTPS-Cin, but its major products are myrcene and (E)-ß-ocimene, and it does not form 1,8-cineole. These data demonstrate that divergence of organ expression pattern and product specificity are ongoing processes within the Arabidopsis TPS family."
Characterization of Biosynthetic Pathways for the Production of the Volatile Homoterpenes DMNT and TMTT in Zea mays  ,"Plant volatiles not only have multiple defense functions against herbivores, fungi, and bacteria, but also have been implicated in signaling within the plant and toward other organisms. Elucidating the function of individual plant volatiles will require more knowledge of their biosynthesis and regulation in response to external stimuli. By exploiting the variation of herbivore-induced volatiles among 26 maize (Zea mays) inbred lines, we conducted a nested association mapping and genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify a set of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for investigating the pathways of volatile terpene production. The most significant identified QTL affects the emission of (E)-nerolidol, linalool, and the two homoterpenes (E)-3,8-dimethyl-1,4,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT). GWAS associated a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter of the gene encoding the terpene synthase TPS2 with this QTL. Biochemical characterization of TPS2 verified that this plastid-localized enzyme forms linalool, (E)-nerolidol, and (E,E)-geranyllinalool. The subsequent conversion of (E)-nerolidol into DMNT maps to a P450 monooxygenase, CYP92C5, which is capable of converting nerolidol into DMNT by oxidative degradation. A QTL influencing TMTT accumulation corresponds to a similar monooxygenase, CYP92C6, which is specific for the conversion of (E,E)-geranyllinalool to TMTT. The DMNT biosynthetic pathway and both monooxygenases are distinct from those previously characterized for DMNT and TMTT synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting independent evolution of these enzymatic activities."
"Characterization of d-Guaiene Synthases from Cultured Cells of Aquilaria, Responsible for the Formation of the Sesquiterpenes in Agarwood","The resinous portions of Aquilaria plants, called agarwood, have been used as medicines and incenses. Agarwood contains a great variety of sesquiterpenes, and a study using cultured cells of Aquilaria showed the production of sesquiterpenes (a-guaiene, a-humulene, and d-guaiene) to be induced by treatment with methyl jasmonate (MJ). In this study, the accumulation and production of sesquiterpenes were quantified. The amounts accumulated and produced reached a maximum at 12 h, and the most abundant product was a-humulene at 6 h and d-guaiene after 12 h. However, a headspace analysis of the cells revealed that a-humulene is likely to be volatilized; so overall, the most abundant sesquiterpene in the cells was d-guaiene. A cDNA library from RNA isolated from MJ-treated cells was screened using PCR methodologies to isolate five clones with very similar amino acid sequences. These clones were expressed in Escherichia coli, and enzymatic reactions using farnesyl pyrophosphate revealed that three of the clones yielded the same compounds as extracted from MJ-treated cells, the major product being d-guaiene. These genes and their encoded enzymes are the first sesquiterpene synthases yielding guaiane-type sesquiterpenes as their major products to be reported. Expression of a fourth terpene synthase gene in bacteria resulted in the accumulation of the protein in insoluble forms. Site-directed mutagenesis of the inactive clone and three-dimensional homology modeling suggested that the structure of the N-terminal domain was important in facilitating proper folding of the protein to form a catalytically active structure."
Chemical and Molecular Ecology of Herbivore-Induced Plant Volatiles: Proximate Factors and Their Ultimate Functions,"In response to herbivory, plants emit specific blends of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). HIPVs mediate sizable arrays of interactions between plants and arthropods, microorganisms, undamaged neighboring plants or undamaged sites within the plant in various ecosystems. HIPV profiles vary according to the plant and herbivore species, and the developmental stages and conditions of the live plants and herbivores. To understand the regulatory mechanisms underling HIPV biosynthesis, the following issues are reviewed here: (i) herbivore-induced formation of plant volatile terpenoids and green leaf volatiles; (ii) initial activation of plant responses by feeding herbivores; and (iii) the downstream network of the signal transduction. To understand the ecological significance of HIPVs, we also review case studies of insect–plant and inter-/intraplant interactions mediated by HIPVs that have been documented in the field and laboratory in recent years."
CitAP2.10 activation of the terpene synthase CsTPS1 is associated with the synthesis of (+)-valencene in ‘Newhall’ orange,"Aroma is a vital characteristic that determines the quality and commercial value of citrus fruits, and characteristic volatiles have been analyzed in different citrus species. In sweet orange, Citrus sinensis, the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene is a key volatile compound in the fruit peel. Valencene synthesis is catalyzed by the terpene synthase CsTPS1, but the transcriptional mechanisms controlling its gene expression are unknown. Here, the AP2/ERF (APETALA2/ethylene response factor) transcription factor, CitAP2.10, is characterized as a regulator of (+)-valencene synthesis. The expression pattern of CitAP2.10 was positively correlated with (+)-valencene content and CsTPS1 expression. Dual-luciferase assays indicated that CitAP2.10 could trans-activate the CsTPS1 promoter. Ethylene enhanced expression of CitAP2.10 and this effect was abolished by the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene. The role and function of CitAP2.10 in (+)-valencene biosynthesis were confirmed using the Arabidopsis homolog (AtWRI1), which also transiently activated the CsTPS1 promoter. Furthermore, transient over-expression of CitAP2.10 triggered (+)-valencene biosynthesis in sweet orange fruit. These results indicate that CitAP2.10 regulates (+)-valencene synthesis via induction of CsTPS1 mRNA accumulation."
Determination of Residues Responsible for Substrate and Product Specificity of Solanum habrochaites Short-Chain cis-Prenyltransferases    ,"Isoprenoids are diverse compounds that have their biosynthetic origin in the initial condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate to form C10 prenyl diphosphates that can be elongated by the addition of subsequent isopentenyl diphosphate units. These reactions are catalyzed by either cis-prenyltransferases (CPTs) or trans-prenyltransferases. The synthesis of volatile terpenes in plants typically proceeds through either geranyl diphosphate (C10) or trans-farnesyl diphosphate (C15), to yield monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, respectively. However, terpene biosynthesis in glandular trichomes of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and related wild relatives also occurs via the cis-substrates neryl diphosphate (NPP) and 2  Z,6  Z-farnesyl diphosphate (Z,Z-FPP). NPP and Z,Z-FPP are synthesized by neryl diphosphate synthase1 (NDPS1) and Z,Z-farnesyl diphosphate synthase (zFPS), which are encoded by the orthologous CPT1 locus in tomato and Solanum habrochaites, respectively. In this study, comparative sequence analysis of NDPS1 and zFPS enzymes from S. habrochaites accessions that synthesize either monoterpenes or sesquiterpenes was performed to identify amino acid residues that correlate with the ability to synthesize NPP or Z,Z-FPP. Subsequent structural modeling, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, highlighted the importance of four amino acids located within conserved domain II of CPT enzymes that form part of the second a-helix, for determining substrate and product specificity of these enzymes. In particular, the relative positioning of aromatic amino acid residues at positions 100 and 107 determines the ability of these enzymes to synthesize NPP or Z,Z-FPP. This study provides insight into the biochemical evolution of terpene biosynthesis in the glandular trichomes of Solanum species."
Distinct metabolic pathways drive monoterpenoid biosynthesis in a natural population of Pelargonium graveolens,"Pelargonium graveolens is a wild predecessor to rose-scented geranium hybrids prized for their essential oils used as fragrances and flavorings. However, little is known about their biosynthesis. Here we present metabolic evidence that at least two distinct monoterpene biosynthetic pathways contribute to their volatile profiles, namely, cyclic p-menthanes such as (-)-isomenthone and acyclic monoterpene alcohols such as geraniol and (-)-citronellol and their derivatives (referred to here as citronelloid monoterpenes). We established their common origin via the 2C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway but found no indication these pathways share common intermediates beyond geranyl diphosphate. Untargeted volatile profiling of 22 seed-grown P. graveolens lines demonstrated distinct chemotypes that preferentially accumulate (-)-isomenthone, geraniol, or (-)-citronellol along with approximately 85 minor volatile products. Whole plant 13CO2 isotopic labeling performed under physiological conditions permitted us to measure the in vivo rates of monoterpenoid accumulation in these lines and quantify differences in metabolic modes between chemotypes. We further determined that p-menthane monoterpenoids in Pelargonium are likely synthesized from (+)-limonene via (+)-piperitone rather than (+)-pulegone. Exploitation of this natural population enabled a detailed dissection of the relative rates of competing p-menthane and citronelloid pathways in this species, providing real time rates of monoterpene accumulation in glandular trichomes."
Ectopic Terpene Synthase Expression Enhances Sesquiterpene Emission in Nicotiana attenuata without Altering Defense or Development of Transgenic Plants or Neighbors  ,"Sesquiterpenoids, with approximately 5,000 structures, are the most diverse class of plant volatiles with manifold hypothesized functions in defense, stress tolerance, and signaling between and within plants. These hypotheses have often been tested by transforming plants with sesquiterpene synthases expressed behind the constitutively active 35S promoter, which may have physiological costs measured as inhibited growth and reduced reproduction or may require augmentation of substrate pools to achieve enhanced emission, complicating the interpretation of data from affected transgenic lines. Here, we expressed maize (Zea mays) terpene synthase10 (ZmTPS10), which produces (E)-a-bergamotene and (E)-ß-farnesene, or a point mutant ZmTPS10M, which produces primarily (E)-ß-farnesene, under control of the 35S promoter in the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata. Transgenic N. attenuata plants had specifically enhanced emission of target sesquiterpene(s) with no changes detected in their emission of any other volatiles. Treatment with herbivore or jasmonate elicitors induces emission of (E)-a-bergamotene in wild-type plants and also tended to increase emission of (E)-a-bergamotene and (E)-ß-farnesene in transgenics. However, transgenics did not differ from the wild type in defense signaling or chemistry and did not alter defense chemistry in neighboring wild-type plants. These data are inconsistent with within-plant and between-plant signaling functions of (E)-ß-farnesene and (E)-a-bergamotene in N. attenuata. Ectopic sesquiterpene emission was apparently not costly for transgenics, which were similar to wild-type plants in their growth and reproduction, even when forced to compete for common resources. These transgenics would be well suited for field experiments to investigate indirect ecological effects of sesquiterpenes for a wild plant in its native habitat."
Elevation of night-time temperature increases terpenoid emissions from Betula pendula and Populus tremula,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are expected to have an important role in plant adaptation to high temperatures. The impacts of increasing night-time temperature on daytime terpenoid emissions and related gene expression in silver birch (Betula pendula) and European aspen (Populus tremula) clones were studied. The plants were grown under five different night-time temperatures (6, 10, 14, 18, and 22?°C) while daytime temperature was kept at a constant 22?°C. VOC emissions were collected during the daytime and analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In birch, emissions per leaf area of the C11 homoterpene 4,8-dimethy1-nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) and several sesquiterpenes were consistently increased with increasing night-time temperature. Total sesquiterpene (SQT) emissions showed an increase at higher temperatures. In aspen, emissions of DMNT and ß-ocimene increased from 6?°C to 14?°C, while several other monoterpenes and the SQTs (Z,E)-a-farnesene and (E,E)-a-farnesene increased up to 18?°C. Total monoterpene and sesquiterpene emission peaked at 18?°C, whereas isoprene emissions decreased at 22?°C. Leaf area increased across the temperature range of 6–22?°C by 32% in birch and by 59% in aspen. Specific leaf area (SLA) was also increased in both species. The genetic regulation of VOC emissions seems to be very complex, as indicated by several inverse relationships between emission profiles and expression of several regulatory genes (DXR, DXS, and IPP). The study indicates that increasing night temperature may strongly affect the quantity and quality of daytime VOC emissions of northern deciduous trees."
ERG9 and COQ1 disruption reveals isoprenoids biosynthesis is closely related to mitochondrial function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Understanding in vivo regulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis is important for identifying strategies to improve carbon fluxes to desirable endproducts. To study the relevance of gene functions, substrate availability, metabolic flux, and the energetics of resource utilization for isoprenoids biosynthesis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was co-engineered with endogenous deregulated erg9 and/or coq1 and exogenous plant genes that will lead to sesqui- and diterpene production. The flow of substrates through the MVA pathway statistically showed isoprenoids precursor levels were tightly regulated by erg9 and coq1 genes in S. cerevisiae. Physiological analysis by fluorescent probes and labeling techniques revealed elimination of the competing and/or degrading pathways by gene knockout can increase cellular stresses and change the energy metabolism. To further evaluate the role of erg9 and coq1 in the regulation of isoprenoids synthesis, heterologous terpene synthases from plants were introduced into S. cerevisiae, including the wild-type and mutant strains along with feeding of various metal cofactors under anoxic/oxic conditions. The product distribution in the strains indicated that the energy barrier could be the reason that different metal ion-assisted electrophilic attacks initiated carbocation formation, carbocation stabilization, and rearrangement, incorporating exquisite regio- and stereospecificity, to generate structurally diverse products. The yeast altered in the profile of terpenoids and their precursor pools aided the mechanisms of terpenoid biosynthesis and its regulation, highlighting the need for mitochondrial function when engineering metabolic flux using assumptions based on a comprehensive network of the mitochondrial system."
Formation of the Unusual Semivolatile Diterpene Rhizathalene by the Arabidopsis Class I Terpene Synthase TPS08 in the Root Stele Is Involved in Defense against Belowground Herbivory,"Secondary metabolites are major constituents of plant defense against herbivore attack. Relatively little is known about the cell type–specific formation and antiherbivore activities of secondary compounds in roots despite the substantial impact of root herbivory on plant performance and fitness. Here, we describe the constitutive formation of semivolatile diterpenes called rhizathalenes by the class I terpene synthase (TPS) 08 in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. The primary enzymatic product of TPS08, rhizathalene A, which is produced from the substrate all-trans geranylgeranyl diphosphate, represents a so far unidentified class of tricyclic diterpene carbon skeletons with an unusual tricyclic spiro-hydrindane structure. Protein targeting and administration of stable isotope precursors indicate that rhizathalenes are biosynthesized in root leucoplasts. TPS08 expression is largely localized to the root stele, suggesting a centric and gradual release of its diterpene products into the peripheral root cell layers. We demonstrate that roots of Arabidopsis tps08 mutant plants, grown aeroponically and in potting substrate, are more susceptible to herbivory by the opportunistic root herbivore fungus gnat (Bradysia spp) and suffer substantial removal of peripheral tissue at larval feeding sites. Our work provides evidence for the in vivo role of semivolatile diterpene metabolites as local antifeedants in belowground direct defense against root-feeding insects."
Functional Analysis of the Final Steps of the 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) Pathway to Isoprenoids in Plants Using Virus-Induced Gene Silencing,"Isoprenoid biosynthesis in plant plastids occurs via the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) pathway. We used tobacco rattle virus (TRV) to posttranscriptionally silence the expression of the last two enzymes of this pathway, the IspG-encoded (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate synthase (HDS) and the IspH-encoded isopentenyl/dimethylallyl diphosphate synthase (IDDS), as well as isopentenyl/dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI), the enzyme that interconverts IPP and DMAPP. TRV-IspG and TRV-IspH infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants had albino leaves that contained less than 4% of the chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments of control leaves. We applied [13C]DXP and [14C]DXP to silenced leaves and found that 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate accumulated in plants blocked at HDS while DXP, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl phosphate and (E)-2-methylbut-2-ene-1,4-diol accumulated in IDDS-blocked plants. Albino leaves from IspG- and IspH-silenced plants displayed a disorganized palisade mesophyll, reduced cuticle, fewer plastids, and disrupted thylakoid membranes. These findings demonstrate the participation of HDS and IDDS in the DXP pathway in plants, and support the view that plastid isoprenoid biosynthesis is metabolically and physically segregated from the mevalonate pathway. IDI-silenced plants had mottled white-pale green leaves with disrupted tissue and plastid structure, and showed an 80% reduction in pigments compared to controls. IPP pyrophosphatase activity was higher in chloroplasts isolated from IDI-silenced plants than in control plant chloroplasts. We suggest that a low level of isoprenoid biosynthesis via the DXP pathway can occur without IDI but that this enzyme is required for full function of the DXP pathway."
Functional Characterization of Terpene Synthases Accounting for the Volatilized-Terpene Heterogeneity in Lathyrus odoratus Cultivar Flowers,"Lathyrus odoratus (sweet pea) is an ornamental plant with exceptional floral scent, previously used as an experimental organism in the early development of Mendelian genetics. However, its terpene synthases (TPSs), which act as metabolic gatekeepers in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids, remain to be characterized. Auto-Headspace Solid-phase Microextraction/Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of floral volatile terpene constituents from seven sweet pea cultivars identified a-bergamotene, linalool, (-)-a-cubebene, geraniol, ß-caryophyllene and ß-sesquiphellandrene as the dominant compounds. RNA sequencing was performed to profile the transcriptome of L. odoratus flowers. Bioinformatic analysis identified eight TPS genes (acronymed as LoTPS) that were successfully cloned, heterologously expressed and functionally analyzed. LoTPS4 and LoTPS7, belonging to the TPS-b clade, biochemically catalyzed the formation of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. LoTPS3 and LoTPS8, placed in the TPS-a clade, also generated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, while LoTPS12 belonging to the TPS-g clade showed linalool/nerolidol synthase activity. Notably, biochemical assays of the recombinant LoTPS proteins revealed their catalytic promiscuity, and the enzymatic products were basically consistent with major volatile compounds released from sweet pea flowers. The data from our study lay the foundation for the chemical ecology, molecular genetics and biotechnological improvement of sweet pea and other legumes (Fabaceae)."
Functional Genomics Reveals That a Compact Terpene Synthase Gene Family Can Account for Terpene Volatile Production in Apple  ,"Terpenes are specialized plant metabolites that act as attractants to pollinators and as defensive compounds against pathogens and herbivores, but they also play an important role in determining the quality of horticultural food products. We show that the genome of cultivated apple (Malus domestica) contains 55 putative terpene synthase (TPS) genes, of which only 10 are predicted to be functional. This low number of predicted functional TPS genes compared with other plant species was supported by the identification of only eight potentially functional TPS enzymes in apple ‘Royal Gala’ expressed sequence tag databases, including the previously characterized apple (E,E)-a-farnesene synthase. In planta functional characterization of these TPS enzymes showed that they could account for the majority of terpene volatiles produced in cv Royal Gala, including the sesquiterpenes germacrene-D and (E)-ß-caryophyllene, the monoterpenes linalool and a-pinene, and the homoterpene (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. Relative expression analysis of the TPS genes indicated that floral and vegetative tissues were the primary sites of terpene production in cv Royal Gala. However, production of cv Royal Gala floral-specific terpenes and TPS genes was observed in the fruit of some heritage apple cultivars. Our results suggest that the apple TPS gene family has been shaped by a combination of ancestral and more recent genome-wide duplication events. The relatively small number of functional enzymes suggests that the remaining terpenes produced in floral and vegetative and fruit tissues are maintained under a positive selective pressure, while the small number of terpenes found in the fruit of modern cultivars may be related to commercial breeding strategies."
Fusarium oxysporum and its bacterial consortium promote lettuce growth and expansin A5 gene expression through microbial volatile organic compound (MVOC) emission,"Fusarium oxysporum MSA 35 [wild-type (WT) strain] is a nonpathogenic Fusarium strain, which exhibits antagonistic activity to plant pathogenic F. oxysporum isolates. The fungus lives in association with a consortium of ectosymbiotic bacteria. The WT strain, when cured of the bacterial symbionts [the cured (CU) form], is pathogenic, causing wilt symptoms similar to those of pathogenic F. oxysporum f. sp. lactucae. Both WT and CU MSA 35 strains produce microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs), but with a different spectrum. In vitro dual culture assays were used to assess the effects of the MVOCs produced by WT and CU strains of F. oxysporum MSA 35 on the growth and expansin gene expression of lettuce seedlings. An increase in the root length (95.6%), shoot length (75.0%) and fresh weight (85.8%) was observed only after WT strain MVOCs exposure. Leaf chlorophyll content was significantly enhanced (68%) in WT strain MVOC-treated seedlings as compared with CU strain volatiles and nontreated controls. ß-Caryophyllene was found to be one of the volatiles released by WT MSA 35 responsible for the plant growth promotion effect. Semi-quantitative and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays indicated a significant difference in the expansin gene expression level between leaf (6.7-fold) and roots (4.4-fold) exposed to WT strain volatiles when compared with the CU strain volatiles and those that were nonexposed."
Microalgae in the postgenomic era: a blooming reservoir for new natural products,"Bacteria, fungi, algae and higher plants are the most prolific producers of natural products (secondary metabolites). Compared to macroalgae, considerably fewer natural products have been isolated from microalgae, which offer the possibility of obtaining sufficient and well-defined biological material from laboratory cultures. Interest in microalgae is reinforced by large-scale data sets from genome sequencing projects and the development of genetic tools such as transformation protocols. This review highlights what is currently known about the biosynthesis and biological role of natural products in microalgae, with examples from isoprenoids, complex polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, polyunsaturated fatty acids and oxylipins, alkaloids, and aromatic secondary metabolites. In addition, we introduce a bioinformatic analysis of available genome sequences from totally 16 microalgae, belonging to the green and red algae, heterokonts and haptophytes. The results suggest that the biosynthetic potential of microalgae is underestimated and many microalgal natural products remain to be discovered."
Gain and Loss of Fruit Flavor Compounds Produced by Wild and Cultivated Strawberry Species,"The blends of flavor compounds produced by fruits serve as biological perfumes used to attract living creatures, including humans. They include hundreds of metabolites and vary in their characteristic fruit flavor composition. The molecular mechanisms by which fruit flavor and aroma compounds are gained and lost during evolution and domestication are largely unknown. Here, we report on processes that may have been responsible for the evolution of diversity in strawberry (Fragaria spp) fruit flavor components. Whereas the terpenoid profile of cultivated strawberry species is dominated by the monoterpene linalool and the sesquiterpene nerolidol, fruit of wild strawberry species emit mainly olefinic monoterpenes and myrtenyl acetate, which are not found in the cultivated species. We used cDNA microarray analysis to identify the F. ananassa Nerolidol Synthase1 (FaNES1) gene in cultivated strawberry and showed that the recombinant FaNES1 enzyme produced in Escherichia coli cells is capable of generating both linalool and nerolidol when supplied with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), respectively. Characterization of additional genes that are very similar to FaNES1 from both the wild and cultivated strawberry species (FaNES2 and F. vesca NES1) showed that only FaNES1 is exclusively present and highly expressed in the fruit of cultivated (octaploid) varieties. It encodes a protein truncated at its N terminus. Green fluorescent protein localization experiments suggest that a change in subcellular localization led to the FaNES1 enzyme encountering both GPP and FPP, allowing it to produce linalool and nerolidol. Conversely, an insertional mutation affected the expression of a terpene synthase gene that differs from that in the cultivated species (termed F. ananassa Pinene Synthase). It encodes an enzyme capable of catalyzing the biosynthesis of the typical wild species monoterpenes, such as a-pinene and ß-myrcene, and caused the loss of these compounds in the cultivated strawberries. The loss of a-pinene also further influenced the fruit flavor profile because it was no longer available as a substrate for the production of the downstream compounds myrtenol and myrtenyl acetate. This phenomenon was demonstrated by cloning and characterizing a cytochrome P450 gene (Pinene Hydroxylase) that encodes the enzyme catalyzing the C10 hydroxylation of a-pinene to myrtenol. The findings shed light on the molecular evolutionary mechanisms resulting in different flavor profiles that are eventually selected for in domesticated species."
Gene Networks Underlying Cannabinoid and Terpenoid Accumulation in Cannabis,"Glandular trichomes are specialized anatomical structures that accumulate secretions with important biological roles in plant-environment interactions. These secretions also have commercial uses in the flavor, fragrance, and pharmaceutical industries. The capitate-stalked glandular trichomes of Cannabis sativa (cannabis), situated on the surfaces of the bracts of the female flowers, are the primary site for the biosynthesis and storage of resins rich in cannabinoids and terpenoids. In this study, we profiled nine commercial cannabis strains with purportedly different attributes, such as taste, color, smell, and genetic origin. Glandular trichomes were isolated from each of these strains, and cell type-specific transcriptome data sets were acquired. Cannabinoids and terpenoids were quantified in flower buds. Statistical analyses indicated that these data sets enable the high-resolution differentiation of strains by providing complementary information. Integrative analyses revealed a coexpression network of genes involved in the biosynthesis of both cannabinoids and terpenoids from imported precursors. Terpene synthase genes involved in the biosynthesis of the major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes routinely assayed by cannabis testing laboratories were identified and functionally evaluated. In addition to cloning variants of previously characterized genes, specifically CsTPS14CT [(-)-limonene synthase] and CsTPS15CT (ß-myrcene synthase), we functionally evaluated genes that encode enzymes with activities not previously described in cannabis, namely CsTPS18VF and CsTPS19BL (nerolidol/linalool synthases), CsTPS16CC (germacrene B synthase), and CsTPS20CT (hedycaryol synthase). This study lays the groundwork for developing a better understanding of the complex chemistry and biochemistry underlying resin accumulation across commercial cannabis strains."
"Identification, functional characterization, and regulation of the enzyme responsible for floral (E)-nerolidol biosynthesis in kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis)","Flowers of the kiwifruit species Actinidia chinensis produce a mixture of sesquiterpenes derived from farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and monoterpenes derived from geranyl diphosphate (GDP). The tertiary sesquiterpene alcohol (E)-nerolidol was the major emitted volatile detected by headspace analysis. Contrastingly, in solvent extracts of the flowers, unusually high amounts of (E,E)-farnesol were observed, as well as lesser amounts of (E)-nerolidol, various farnesol and farnesal isomers, and linalool. Using a genomics-based approach, a single gene (AcNES1) was identified in an A. chinensis expressed sequence tag library that had significant homology to known floral terpene synthase enzymes. In vitro characterization of recombinant AcNES1 revealed it was an enzyme that could catalyse the conversion of FDP and GDP to the respective (E)-nerolidol and linalool terpene alcohols. Enantiomeric analysis of both AcNES1 products in vitro and floral terpenes in planta showed that (S)-(E)-nerolidol was the predominant enantiomer. Real-time PCR analysis indicated peak expression of AcNES1 correlated with peak (E)-nerolidol, but not linalool accumulation in flowers. This result, together with subcellular protein localization to the cytoplasm, indicated that AcNES1 was acting as a (S)-(E)-nerolidol synthase in A. chinensis flowers. The synthesis of high (E,E)-farnesol levels appears to compete for the available pool of FDP utilized by AcNES1 for sesquiterpene biosynthesis and hence strongly influences the accumulation and emission of (E)-nerolidol in A. chinensis flowers."
Induction of Volatile Terpene Biosynthesis and Diurnal Emission by Methyl Jasmonate in Foliage of Norway Spruce,"Terpenoids are characteristic constitutive and inducible defense chemicals of conifers. The biochemical regulation of terpene formation, accumulation, and release from conifer needles was studied in Norway spruce [Picea abies L. (Karst)] saplings using methyl jasmonate (MeJA) to induce defensive responses without inflicting physical damage to terpene storage structures. MeJA treatment caused a 2-fold increase in monoterpene and sesquiterpene accumulation in needles without changes in terpene composition, much less than the 10- and 40-fold increases in monoterpenes and diterpenes, respectively, observed in wood tissue after MeJA treatment (D. Martin, D. Tholl, J. Gershenzon, J. Bohlmann [2002] Plant Physiol 129: 1003–1018). At the same time, MeJA triggered a 5-fold increase in total terpene emission from foliage, with a shift in composition to a blend dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes (e.g. linalool) and sesquiterpenes [e.g. (E)-ß-farnesene] that also included methyl salicylate. The rate of linalool emission increased more than 100-fold and that of sesquiterpenes increased more than 30-fold. Emission of these compounds followed a pronounced diurnal rhythm with the maximum amount released during the light period. The major MeJA-induced volatile terpenes appear to be synthesized de novo after treatment, rather than being released from stored terpene pools, because they are almost completely absent from needle oleoresin and are the major products of terpene synthase activity measured after MeJA treatment. Based on precedents in other species, the induced emission of terpenes from Norway spruce foliage may have ecological and physiological significance."
"Insect-Induced Conifer Defense. White Pine Weevil and Methyl Jasmonate Induce Traumatic Resinosis, de Novo Formed Volatile Emissions, and Accumulation of Terpenoid Synthase and Putative Octadecanoid Pathway Transcripts in Sitka Spruce  ","Stem-boring insects and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) are thought to induce similar complex chemical and anatomical defenses in conifers. To compare insect- and MeJA-induced terpenoid responses, we analyzed traumatic oleoresin mixtures, emissions of terpenoid volatiles, and expression of terpenoid synthase (TPS) genes in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) following attack by white pine weevils (Pissodes strobi) or application of MeJA. Both insects and MeJA caused traumatic resin accumulation in stems, with more accumulation induced by the weevils. Weevil-induced terpenoid emission profiles were also more complex than emissions induced by MeJA. Weevil feeding caused a rapid release of a blend of monoterpene olefins, presumably by passive evaporation of resin compounds from stem feeding sites. These compounds were not found in MeJA-induced emissions. Both weevils and MeJA caused delayed, diurnal emissions of (-)-linalool, indicating induced de novo biosynthesis of this compound. TPS transcripts strongly increased in stems upon insect attack or MeJA treatment. Time courses and intensity of induced TPS transcripts were different for monoterpene synthases, sesquiterpene synthases, and diterpene synthases. Increased levels of weevil- and MeJA-induced TPS transcripts accompanied major changes in terpenoid accumulation in stems. Induced TPS expression profiles in needles were less complex than those in stems and matched induced de novo emissions of (-)-linalool. Overall, weevils and MeJA induced similar, but not identical, terpenoid defense responses in Sitka spruce. Findings of insect- and MeJA-induced accumulation of allene oxide synthase-like and allene oxide cyclase-like transcripts are discussed in the context of traumatic resinosis and induced volatile emissions in this gymnosperm system."
Medicago TERPENE SYNTHASE 10 Is Involved in Defense Against an Oomycete Root Pathogen,"In nature, plants interact with numerous beneficial or pathogenic soil-borne microorganisms. Plants have developed various defense strategies to expel pathogenic microbes, some of which function soon after pathogen infection. We used Medicago truncatula and its oomycete pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches to elucidate early responses of the infected root. A. euteiches causes root rot disease in legumes and is a limiting factor in legume production. Transcript profiling of seedlings and adult plant roots inoculated with A. euteiches zoospores for 2 h revealed specific upregulation of a gene encoding a putative sesquiterpene synthase (M. truncatula TERPENE SYNTHASE 10 [MtTPS10]) in both developmental stages. MtTPS10 was specifically expressed in roots upon oomycete infection. Heterologous expression of MtTPS10 in yeast led to production of a blend of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpene alcohols, with NMR identifying a major peak corresponding to himalachol. Moreover, plants carrying a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) retrotransposon Tnt1 insertion in MtTPS10 lacked the emission of sesquiterpenes upon A. euteiches infection, supporting the assumption that the identified gene encodes a multiproduct sesquiterpene synthase. Mttps10 plants and plants with reduced MtTPS10 transcript levels created by expression of an MtTPS10-artificial microRNA in roots were more susceptible to A. euteiches infection than were the corresponding wild-type plants and roots transformed with the empty vector, respectively. Sesquiterpenes produced by expression of MtTPS10 in yeast also inhibited mycelial growth and A. euteiches zoospore germination. These data suggest that sesquiterpene production in roots by MtTPS10 plays a previously unrecognized role in the defense response of M. truncatula against A. euteiches."
"Methyl Jasmonate Induces Traumatic Resin Ducts, Terpenoid Resin Biosynthesis, and Terpenoid Accumulation in Developing Xylem of Norway Spruce Stems","Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) produces an oleoresin characterized by a diverse array of terpenoids, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and diterpene resin acids that can protect conifers against potential herbivores and pathogens. Oleoresin accumulates constitutively in resin ducts in the cortex and phloem (bark) of Norway spruce stems. De novo formation of traumatic resin ducts (TDs) is observed in the developing secondary xylem (wood) after insect attack, fungal elicitation, and mechanical wounding. Here, we characterize the methyl jasmonate-induced formation of TDs in Norway spruce by microscopy, chemical analyses of resin composition, and assays of terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes. The response involves tissue-specific differentiation of TDs, terpenoid accumulation, and induction of enzyme activities of both prenyltransferases and terpene synthases in the developing xylem, a tissue that constitutively lacks axial resin ducts in spruce. The induction of a complex defense response in Norway spruce by methyl jasmonate application provides new avenues to evaluate the role of resin defenses for protection of conifers against destructive pests such as white pine weevils (Pissodes strobi), bark beetles (Coleoptera, Scolytidae), and insect-associated tree pathogens."
Biochemistry of Terpenes and Recent Advances in Plant Protection,"
Biodiversity is adversely affected by the growing levels of synthetic chemicals released into the environment due to agricultural activities. This has been the driving force for embracing sustainable agriculture. Plant secondary metabolites offer promising alternatives for protecting plants against microbes, feeding herbivores, and weeds. Terpenes are the largest among PSMs and have been extensively studied for their potential as antimicrobial, insecticidal, and weed control agents. They also attract natural enemies of pests and beneficial insects, such as pollinators and dispersers. However, most of these research findings are shelved and fail to pass beyond the laboratory and greenhouse stages. This review provides an overview of terpenes, types, biosynthesis, and their roles in protecting plants against microbial pathogens, insect pests, and weeds to rekindle the debate on using terpenes for the development of environmentally friendly biopesticides and herbicides.

Biological Importance of Cotton By-Products Relative to Chemical Constituents of the Cotton Plant,"
Although cultivated for over 7000 years, mainly for production of cotton fibre, the cotton plant has not been fully explored for potential uses of its other parts. Despite cotton containing many important chemical compounds, limited understanding of its phytochemical composition still exists. In order to add value to waste products of the cotton industry, such as cotton gin trash, this review focuses on phytochemicals associated with different parts of cotton plants and their biological activities. Three major classes of compounds and some primary metabolites have been previously identified in the plant. Among these compounds, most terpenoids and their derivatives (51), fatty acids (four), and phenolics (six), were found in the leaves, bolls, stalks, and stems. Biological activities, such as anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities, are associated with some of these phytochemicals. For example, ß-bisabolol, a sesquiterpenoid enriched in the flowers of cotton plants, may have anti-inflammatory product application. Considering the abundance of biologically active compounds in the cotton plant, there is scope to develop a novel process within the current cotton fibre production system to separate these valuable phytochemicals, developing them into potentially high-value products. This scenario may present the cotton processing industry with an innovative pathway towards a waste-to-profit solution.

Chemical Diversity and Defence Metabolism: How Plants Cope with Pathogens and Ozone Pollution,"
Chemical defences represent a main trait of the plant innate immune system. Besides regulating the relationship between plants and their ecosystems, phytochemicals are involved both in resistance against pathogens and in tolerance towards abiotic stresses, such as atmospheric pollution. Plant defence metabolites arise from the main secondary metabolic routes, the phenylpropanoid, the isoprenoid and the alkaloid pathways. In plants, antibiotic compounds can be both preformed (phytoanticipins) and inducible (phytoalexins), the former including saponins, cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates. Chronic exposure to tropospheric ozone (O3) stimulates the carbon fluxes from the primary to the secondary metabolic pathways to a great extent, inducing a shift of the available resources in favour of the synthesis of secondary products. In some cases, the plant defence responses against pathogens and environmental pollutants may overlap, leading to the unspecific synthesis of similar molecules, such as phenylpropanoids. Exposure to ozone can also modify the pattern of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), emitted from plant in response to herbivore feeding, thus altering the tritrophic interaction among plant, phytophagy and their natural enemies. Finally, the synthesis of ethylene and polyamines can be regulated by ozone at level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the biosynthetic precursor of both classes of hormones, which can, therefore, mutually inhibit their own biosynthesis with consequence on plant phenotype.

Chemical Diversity of Headspace and Volatile Oil Composition of Two Brown Algae (Taonia atomaria and Padina pavonica) from the Adriatic Sea,"
Two selected brown algae (Taonia atomaria and Padina pavonica from the family Dictyotaceae, order Dictyotales) growing in the same area (island Vis, central Adriatic Sea) were collected at the same time. Their phytochemical composition of the headspace volatile organic compounds (HS-VOCs; first time report) was determined by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME). Hydrodistillation was applied for the isolation of their volatile oils (first report on T. atomaria volatile oil). The isolates were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-FID) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The headspace and oil composition of T. atomaria were quite similar (containing germacrene D, epi-bicyclosesquiphellandrene, ß-cubebene and gleenol as the major compounds). However, P. pavonica headspace and oil composition differed significantly (dimethyl sulfide, octan-1-ol and octanal dominated in the headspace, while the oil contained mainly higher aliphatic alcohols, trans-phytol and pachydictol A). Performed research contributes to the knowledge of the algae chemical biodiversity and reports an array of different compounds (mainly sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and aliphatic compounds); many of them were identified in both algae for the first time. Identified VOCs with distinctive chemical structures could be useful for taxonomic studies of related algae.

Citrus Leaf Volatiles as Affected by Developmental Stage and Genetic Type,"
Major volatiles from young and mature leaves of different citrus types were analyzed by headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME)-GC-MS. A total of 123 components were identified form nine citrus cultivars, including nine aldehydes, 19 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 27 oxygenated monoterpenes, 43 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, eight oxygenated sesquiterpenes, two ketones, six esters and nine miscellaneous. Young leaves produced higher amounts of volatiles than mature leaves in most cultivars. The percentage of aldehyde and monoterpene hydrocarbons increased, whilst oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes compounds decreased during leaf development. Linalool was the most abundant compound in young leaves, whereas limonene was the chief component in mature ones. Notably, linalool content decreased, while limonene increased, during leaf development in most cultivars. Leaf volatiles were also affected by genetic types. A most abundant volatile in one or several genotypes can be absent in another one(s), such as limonene in young leaves of lemon vs. Satsuma mandarin and ß-terpinene in mature leaves of three genotypes vs. the other four. Compositional data was subjected to multivariate statistical analysis, and variations in leaf volatiles were identified and clustered into six groups. This research determining the relationship between production of major volatiles from different citrus varieties and leaf stages could be of use for industrial and culinary purposes.

Digital Gene Expression Profiling to Explore Differentially Expressed Genes Associated with Terpenoid Biosynthesis during Fruit Development in Litsea cubeba,"
Mountain pepper (Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers.) (Lauraceae) is an important industrial crop as an ingredient in cosmetics, pesticides, food additives and potential biofuels. These properties are attributed to monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. However, there is still no integrated model describing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in terpenoid biosynthesis during the fruit development of L. cubeba. Here, we performed digital gene expression (DGE) using the Illumina NGS platform to evaluated changes in gene expression during fruit development in L. cubeba. DGE generated expression data for approximately 19354 genes. Fruit at 60 days after flowering (DAF) served as the control, and a total of 415, 1255, 449 and 811 up-regulated genes and 505, 1351, 1823 and 1850 down-regulated genes were identified at 75, 90, 105 and 135 DAF, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed 26 genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. Three DEGs had continued increasing or declining trends during the fruit development. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results of five differentially expressed genes were consistent with those obtained from Illumina sequencing. These results provide a comprehensive molecular biology background for research on fruit development, and information that should aid in metabolic engineering to increase the yields of L. cubeba essential oil.

"Electronic-Nose Applications for Fruit Identification, Ripeness and Quality Grading","
Fruits produce a wide range of volatile organic compounds that impart their characteristically distinct aromas and contribute to unique flavor characteristics. Fruit aroma and flavor characteristics are of key importance in determining consumer acceptance in commercial fruit markets based on individual preference. Fruit producers, suppliers and retailers traditionally utilize and rely on human testers or panels to evaluate fruit quality and aroma characters for assessing fruit salability in fresh markets. We explore the current and potential utilization of electronic-nose devices (with specialized sensor arrays), instruments that are very effective in discriminating complex mixtures of fruit volatiles, as new effective tools for more efficient fruit aroma analyses to replace conventional expensive methods used in fruit aroma assessments. We review the chemical nature of fruit volatiles during all stages of the agro-fruit production process, describe some of the more important applications that electronic nose (e-nose) technologies have provided for fruit aroma characterizations, and summarize recent research providing e-nose data on the effectiveness of these specialized gas-sensing instruments for fruit identifications, cultivar discriminations, ripeness assessments and fruit grading for assuring fruit quality in commercial markets.

Essential Oils as Feed Additives—Future Perspectives,"
The inconsistency of phytogenic feed additives’ (PFA) effects on the livestock industry poses a risk for their use as a replacement for antibiotic growth promoters. The livestock market is being encouraged to use natural growth promotors, but information is limited about the PFA mode of action. The aim of this paper is to present the complexity of compounds present in essential oils (EOs) and factors that influence biological effects of PFA. In this paper, we highlight various controls and optimization parameters that influence the processes for the standardization of these products. The chemical composition of EOs depends on plant genetics, growth conditions, development stage at harvest, and processes of extracting active compounds. Their biological effects are further influenced by the interaction of phytochemicals and their bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. PFA effects on animal health and production are also complex due to various EO antibiotic, antioxidant, anti-quorum sensing, anti-inflammatory, and digestive fluids stimulating activities. Research must focus on reliable methods to identify and control the quality and effects of EOs. In this study, we focused on available microencapsulation techniques of EOs to increase the bioavailability of active compounds, as well as their application in the animal feed additive industry.

Evolution of Terpene Synthases in Orchidaceae,"
Terpenoids are the largest class of plant secondary metabolites and are one of the major emitted volatile compounds released to the atmosphere. They have functions of attracting pollinators or defense function, insecticidal properties, and are even used as pharmaceutical agents. Because of the importance of terpenoids, an increasing number of plants are required to investigate the function and evolution of terpene synthases (TPSs) that are the key enzymes in terpenoids biosynthesis. Orchidacea, containing more than 800 genera and 28,000 species, is one of the largest and most diverse families of flowering plants, and is widely distributed. Here, the diversification of the TPSs evolution in Orchidaceae is revealed. A characterization and phylogeny of TPSs from four different species with whole genome sequences is available. Phylogenetic analysis of orchid TPSs indicates these genes are divided into TPS-a, -b, -e/f, and g subfamilies, and their duplicated copies are increased in derived orchid species compared to that in the early divergence orchid, A. shenzhenica. The large increase of both TPS-a and TPS-b copies can probably be attributed to the pro-duction of different volatile compounds for attracting pollinators or generating chemical defenses in derived orchid lineages; while the duplications of TPS-g and TPS-e/f copies occurred in a species-dependent manner.

Exploring Plant Sesquiterpene Diversity by Generating Chemical Networks,"
Plants produce a diverse portfolio of sesquiterpenes that are important in their response to herbivores and the interaction with other plants. Their biosynthesis from farnesyl diphosphate depends on the sesquiterpene synthases that admit different cyclizations and rearrangements to yield a blend of sesquiterpenes. Here, we investigate to what extent sesquiterpene biosynthesis metabolic pathways can be reconstructed just from the knowledge of the final product and the reaction mechanisms catalyzed by sesquiterpene synthases. We use the software package MedØlDatschgerl (MØD) to generate chemical networks and to elucidate pathways contained in them. As examples, we successfully consider the reachability of the important plant sesquiterpenes    ß   -caryophyllene,    a   -humulene, and    ß   -farnesene. We also introduce a graph database to integrate the simulation results with experimental biological evidence for the selected predicted sesquiterpenes biosynthesis.

Expression of Terpenoid Biosynthetic Genes and Accumulation of Chemical Constituents in Valeriana fauriei,"
Valeriana fauriei (V. fauriei), which emits a characteristic and unpleasant odor, is important in traditional medicine. In this study, the expression of terpenoid biosynthetic genes was investigated in different organs that were also screened for volatile compounds including valerenic acid and its derivatives. Specific expression patterns from different parts of V. fauriei were observed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The highest transcript levels of biosynthetic genes involved in mevalonic acid (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) production were found in the stem. Although the amounts of volatile compounds were varied by organ, most of the volatile terpenoids were accumulated in the root. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 128 volatile compounds, which represented 65.33% to 95.66% of total volatiles. Certain compounds were only found in specific organs. For example, isovalerenic acid and valerenic acid and its derivatives were restricted to the root. Organs with high transcript levels did not necessarily have high levels of the corresponding chemical constituents. According to these results, we hypothesize that translocation may occur between different organs in V. fauriei.

Forest Volatile Organic Compounds and Their Effects on Human Health: A State-of-the-Art Review,"
The aim of this research work is to analyze the chemistry and diversity of forest VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and to outline their evidence-based effects on health. This research work was designed as a narrative overview of the scientific literature. Inhaling forest VOCs like limonene and pinene can result in useful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on the airways, and the pharmacological activity of some terpenes absorbed through inhalation may be also beneficial to promote brain functions by decreasing mental fatigue, inducing relaxation, and improving cognitive performance and mood. The tree composition can markedly influence the concentration of specific VOCs in the forest air, which also exhibits cyclic diurnal variations. Moreover, beneficial psychological and physiological effects of visiting a forest cannot be solely attributed to VOC inhalation but are due to a global and integrated stimulation of the five senses, induced by all specific characteristics of the natural environment, with the visual component probably playing a fundamental role in the overall effect. Globally, these findings can have useful implications for individual wellbeing, public health, and landscape design. Further clinical and environmental studies are advised, since the majority of the existing evidence is derived from laboratory findings.

"Functional Characterisation of New Sesquiterpene Synthase from the Malaysian Herbal Plant, Polygonum Minus","
Polygonum minus (syn. Persicaria minor) is a herbal plant that is well known for producing sesquiterpenes, which contribute to its flavour and fragrance. This study describes the cloning and functional characterisation of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2, two sesquiterpene synthase genes that were identified from P. minus transcriptome data mining. The full-length sequences of the PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 genes were expressed in the E. coli pQE-2 expression vector. The sizes of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 were 1098 bp and 1967 bp, respectively, with open reading frames (ORF) of 1047 and 1695 bp and encoding polypeptides of 348 and 564 amino acids, respectively. The proteins consist of three conserved motifs, namely, Asp-rich substrate binding (DDxxD), metal binding residues (NSE/DTE), and cytoplasmic ER retention (RxR), as well as the terpene synthase family N-terminal domain and C-terminal metal-binding domain. From the in vitro enzyme assays, using the farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) substrate, the PmSTPS1 enzyme produced multiple acyclic sesquiterpenes of ß-farnesene, a-farnesene, and farnesol, while the PmSTPS2 enzyme produced an additional nerolidol as a final product. The results confirmed the roles of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 in the biosynthesis pathway of P. minus, to produce aromatic sesquiterpenes.

"Fundamental Chemistry of Essential Oils and Volatile Organic Compounds, Methods of Analysis and Authentication","
The current text provides a comprehensive introduction to essential oils, their biosynthesis, naming, analysis, and chemistry. Importantly, this text quickly brings the reader up to a level of competence in the authentication of essential oils and their components. It gives detailed descriptions of enantiomers and other forms of stereoisomers relevant to the study of natural volatiles and essential oils. The text also describes GC-MS work and provides tips on rapid calculation of arithmetic indices, how to interpret suggested names from the NIST mass spectral library, and what additional efforts are required to validate essential oils and defeat sophisticated adulteration tactics. In brief, essential oils are mixtures of volatile organic compounds that were driven out of the raw plant material in distillation, condensed into an oil that is strongly aroma emitting, and collected in a vessel as the top layer (uncommonly bottom layer) of two phase separated liquids: oil and water. Essential oils commonly include components derived from two biosynthetic groups, being terpenes (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and their derivatives) and phenylpropanoids (aromatic ring with a propene tail). The current text provides details of how terpenes and phenylpropanoids are further categorised according to their parent skeleton, then recognised by the character of oxidation, which may be from oxygen, nitrogen, or sulphur, or the presence/absence of a double bond. The essential oil’s science niche is an epicentre of individuals from diverse backgrounds, such as aromatherapy, pharmacy, synthetic and analytical chemistry, or the hobbyist. To make the science more accessible to the curious student or researcher, it was necessary to write this fundamentals-level introduction to the chemistry of essential oils (i.e., organic chemistry in the context of essential oils), which is herein presented as a comprehensive and accessible overview. Lastly, the current review constitutes the only resource that highlights common errors and explains in simplistic detail how to correctly interpret GC-MS data then accurately present the respective chemical information to the wider scientific audience. Therefore, detailed study of the contents herein will equip the individual with prerequisite knowledge necessary to effectively analyse an essential oil and make qualified judgement on its authenticity.

Genome-Wide Analysis of Terpene Synthase Gene Family in Mentha longifolia and Catalytic Activity Analysis of a Single Terpene Synthase,"
Terpenoids are a wide variety of natural products and terpene synthase (TPS) plays a key role in the biosynthesis of terpenoids. Mentha plants are rich in essential oils, whose main components are terpenoids, and their biosynthetic pathways have been basically elucidated. However, there is a lack of systematic identification and study of TPS in Mentha plants. In this work, we genome-widely identified and analyzed the TPS gene family in Mentha longifolia, a model plant for functional genomic research in the genus Mentha. A total of 63 TPS genes were identified in the M. longifolia genome sequence assembly, which could be divided into six subfamilies. The TPS-b subfamily had the largest number of genes, which might be related to the abundant monoterpenoids in Mentha plants. The TPS-e subfamily had 18 members and showed a significant species-specific expansion compared with other sequenced Lamiaceae plant species. The 63 TPS genes could be mapped to nine scaffolds of the M. longifolia genome sequence assembly and the distribution of these genes is uneven. Tandem duplicates and fragment duplicates contributed greatly to the increase in the number of TPS genes in M. longifolia. The conserved motifs (RR(X)8W, NSE/DTE, RXR, and DDXXD) were analyzed in M. longifolia TPSs, and significant differentiation was found between different subfamilies. Adaptive evolution analysis showed that M. longifolia TPSs were subjected to purifying selection after the species-specific expansion, and some amino acid residues under positive selection were identified. Furthermore, we also cloned and analyzed the catalytic activity of a single terpene synthase, MlongTPS29, which belongs to the TPS-b subfamily. MlongTPS29 could encode a limonene synthase and catalyze the biosynthesis of limonene, an important precursor of essential oils from the genus Mentha. This study provides useful information for the biosynthesis of terpenoids in the genus Mentha.

Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Profile of TPS Gene Family in Dendrobium officinale and the Role of DoTPS10 in Linalool Biosynthesis,"
Terpene synthase (TPS) is a critical enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of terpenes, which possess diverse roles in plant growth and development. Although many terpenes have been reported in orchids, limited information is available regarding the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TPS family in the orchid, Dendrobium officinale. By integrating the D. officinale genome and transcriptional data, 34 TPS genes were found in D. officinale. These were divided into four subfamilies (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, and TPS-e/f). Distinct tempospatial expression profiles of DoTPS genes were observed in 10 organs of D. officinale. Most DoTPS genes were predominantly expressed in flowers, followed by roots and stems. Expression of the majority of DoTPS genes was enhanced following exposure to cold and osmotic stresses. Recombinant DoTPS10 protein, located in chloroplasts, uniquely converted geranyl diphosphate to linalool in vitro. The DoTPS10 gene, which resulted in linalool formation, was highly expressed during all flower developmental stages. Methyl jasmonate significantly up-regulated DoTPS10 expression and linalool accumulation. These results simultaneously provide valuable insight into understanding the roles of the TPS family and lay a basis for further studies on the regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis by DoTPS in D. officinale.

Heterologous Production of ß-Caryophyllene and Evaluation of Its Activity against Plant Pathogenic Fungi,"
Terpenoids constitute one of the largest and most diverse groups within the class of secondary metabolites, comprising over 80,000 compounds. They not only exhibit important functions in plant physiology but also have commercial potential in the biotechnological, pharmaceutical, and agricultural sectors due to their promising properties, including various bioactivities against pathogens, inflammations, and cancer. In this work, we therefore aimed to implement the plant sesquiterpenoid pathway leading to ß-caryophyllene in the heterologous host Rhodobacter capsulatus and achieved a maximum production of 139 ± 31 mg L-1 culture. As this sesquiterpene offers various beneficial anti-phytopathogenic activities, we evaluated the bioactivity of ß-caryophyllene and its oxygenated derivative ß-caryophyllene oxide against different phytopathogenic fungi. Here, both compounds significantly inhibited the growth of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Fusarium oxysporum by up to 40%, while growth of Alternaria brassicicola was only slightly affected, and Phoma lingam and Rhizoctonia solani were unaffected. At the same time, the compounds showed a promising low inhibitory profile for a variety of plant growth-promoting bacteria at suitable compound concentrations. Our observations thus give a first indication that ß-caryophyllene and ß-caryophyllene oxide are promising natural agents, which might be applicable for the management of certain plant pathogenic fungi in agricultural crop production.

Identification and Characterization of trans-Isopentenyl Diphosphate Synthases Involved in Herbivory-Induced Volatile Terpene Formation in Populus trichocarpa,"
In response to insect herbivory, poplar releases a blend of volatiles that plays important roles in plant defense. Although the volatile bouquet is highly complex and comprises several classes of compounds, it is dominated by mono- and sesquiterpenes. The most common precursors for mono- and sesquiterpenes, geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), respectively, are in general produced by homodimeric or heterodimeric trans-isopentenyl diphosphate synthases (trans-IDSs) that belong to the family of prenyltransferases. To understand the molecular basis of herbivory-induced terpene formation in poplar, we investigated the trans-IDS gene family in the western balsam poplar Populus trichocarpa. Sequence comparisons suggested that this species possesses a single FPP synthase gene (PtFPPS1) and four genes encoding two large subunits (PtGPPS1.LSU and PtGPPS2.LSU) and two small subunits (PtGPPS.SSU1 and PtGPPS.SSU2) of GPP synthases. Transcript accumulation of PtGPPS1.LSU and PtGPPS.SSU1 was significantly upregulated upon leaf herbivory, while the expression of PtFPPS1, PtGPPS2.LSU, and PtGPPS.SSU2 was not influenced by the herbivore treatment. Heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of recombinant PtFPPS1, PtGPPS1.LSU, and PtGPPS2.LSU confirmed their respective IDS activities. Recombinant PtGPPS.SSU1 and PtGPPS.SSU2, however, had no enzymatic activity on their own, but PtGPPS.SSU1 enhanced the GPP synthase activities of PtGPPS1.LSU and PtGPPS2.LSU in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that PtGPPS1.LSU and PtGPPS2.LSU in combination with PtGPPS.SSU1 may provide the substrate for herbivory-induced monoterpene formation in P. trichocarpa. The sole FPP synthase PtFPPS1 likely produces FPP for both primary and specialized metabolism in this plant species.

Identification of a Plastid-Localized Bifunctional Nerolidol/Linalool Synthase in Relation to Linalool Biosynthesis in Young Grape Berries,"
Monoterpenoids are a diverse class of natural products and contribute to the important varietal aroma of certain Vitis vinifera grape cultivars. Among the typical monoterpenoids, linalool exists in almost all grape varieties. A gene coding for a nerolidol/linalool (NES/LINS) synthase was evaluated in the role of linalool biosynthesis in grape berries. Enzyme activity assay of this recombinant protein revealed that it could convert geranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate into linalool and nerolidol in vitro, respectively, and thus it was named VvRILinNer. However, localization experiment showed that this enzyme was only localized to chloroplasts, which indicates that VvRILinNer functions in the linalool production in vivo. The patterns of gene expression and linalool accumulation were analyzed in the berries of three grape cultivars (“Riesling”, “Cabernet Sauvignon”, “Gewurztraminer”) with significantly different levels of monoterpenoids. The VvRILinNer was considered to be mainly responsible for the synthesis of linalool at the early developmental stage. This finding has provided us with new knowledge to uncover the complex monoterpene biosynthesis in grapes.

Identification of microRNAs from Medicinal Plant Murraya koenigii by High-Throughput Sequencing and Their Functional Implications in Secondary Metabolite Biosynthesis,"
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that play crucial post-transcriptional regulatory roles in plants, including development and stress-response signaling. However, information about their involvement in secondary metabolism is still limited. Murraya koenigii is a popular medicinal plant, better known as curry leaves, that possesses pharmaceutically active secondary metabolites. The present study utilized high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate the miRNA profile of M. koenigii and their association with secondary metabolite biosynthesis. A total of 343,505 unique reads with lengths ranging from 16 to 40 nt were obtained from the sequencing data, among which 142 miRNAs were identified as conserved and 7 as novel miRNAs. Moreover, 6078 corresponding potential target genes of M. koenigii miRNAs were recognized in this study. Interestingly, several conserved and novel miRNAs of M. koenigii were found to target key enzymes of the terpenoid backbone and the flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, to validate the sequencing results, the relative expression of eight randomly selected miRNAs was determined by qPCR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the M. koenigii miRNA profile that may provide useful information for further elucidation of the involvement of miRNAs in secondary metabolism. These findings might be crucial in the future to generate artificial-miRNA-based, genetically engineered M. koenigii plants for the overproduction of medicinally highly valuable secondary metabolites.

Integration of Metabolite Profiling and Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Genes Related to Volatile Terpenoid Metabolism in Finger Citron (C. medica var. sarcodactylis),"
Finger citron (Citrus medica var. sarcodactylis) is a popular ornamental tree and an important source of essential oils rich in terpenoids, but the mechanisms behind volatile formation are poorly understood. We investigated gene expression changes combined with volatile profiling of ten samples from three developing organs: flower, leaf, and fruit. A total of 62 volatiles were identified with limonene and ?-terpinene being the most abundant ones. Six volatiles were identified using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) that could be used as markers for distinguishing finger citron from other citrus species. RNA-Seq revealed 1,611,966,118 high quality clean reads that were assembled into 32,579 unigenes. From these a total of 58 terpene synthase (TPS) gene family members were identified and the spatial and temporal distribution of their transcripts was measured in developing organs. Transcript levels of transcription factor genes AP2/ERF (251), bHLH (169), bZIP (76), MYB (155), NAC (184), and WRKY (66) during finger citron development were also analyzed. From extracted subnetworks of three modules constructed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), thirteen TPS genes and fifteen transcription factors were suggested to be related to volatile terpenoid formation. These results provide a framework for future investigations into the identification and regulatory network of terpenoids in finger citron.

"Medically Useful Plant Terpenoids: Biosynthesis, Occurrence, and Mechanism of Action","
Specialized plant terpenoids have found fortuitous uses in medicine due to their evolutionary and biochemical selection for biological activity in animals. However, these highly functionalized natural products are produced through complex biosynthetic pathways for which we have a complete understanding in only a few cases. Here we review some of the most effective and promising plant terpenoids that are currently used in medicine and medical research and provide updates on their biosynthesis, natural occurrence, and mechanism of action in the body. This includes pharmacologically useful plastidic terpenoids such as p-menthane monoterpenoids, cannabinoids, paclitaxel (taxol®), and ingenol mebutate which are derived from the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, as well as cytosolic terpenoids such as thapsigargin and artemisinin produced through the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. We further provide a review of the MEP and MVA precursor pathways which supply the carbon skeletons for the downstream transformations yielding these medically significant natural products.

Metabolic Engineering of the Native Monoterpene Pathway in Spearmint for Production of Heterologous Monoterpenes Reveals Complex Metabolism and Pathway Interactions,"
Spearmint produces and stores large amounts of monoterpenes, mainly limonene and carvone, in glandular trichomes and is the major natural source of these compounds. Towards producing heterologous monoterpenes in spearmint, we first reduced the flux into the native limonene pathway by knocking down the expression of limonene synthase (MsLS) by RNAi method. The MsLS RNAi lines exhibited a huge reduction in the synthesis of limonene and carvone. Detailed GC-MS and LC-MS analysis revealed that MsLS RNAi plants also showed an increase in sesquiterpene, phytosterols, fatty acids, flavonoids, and phenolic metabolites, suggesting an interaction between the MEP, MVA shikimate and fatty acid pathways in spearmint. Three different heterologous monoterpene synthases namely, linalool synthase and myrcene synthase from Picea abies and geraniol synthase from Cananga odorata were cloned and introduced independently into the MsLS RNAi mutant background. The expression of these heterologous terpene synthases resulted mainly in production of monoterpene derivatives. Of all the introduced monoterpenes geraniol showed the maximum number of derivatives. Our results provide new insights into MEP pathway interactions and regulation and reveals the existence of mechanisms for complex metabolism of monoterpenes in spearmint.

Metabolic Perturbation and Synthetic Biology Strategies for Plant Terpenoid Production—An Updated Overview,"
Terpenoids represent one of the high-value groups of specialized metabolites with vast structural diversity. They exhibit versatile human benefits and have been successfully exploited in several sectors of day-to-day life applications, including cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceuticals. Historically, the potential use of terpenoids is challenging, and highly hampered by their bioavailability in their natural sources. Significant progress has been made in recent years to overcome such challenges by advancing the heterologous production platforms of hosts and metabolic engineering technologies. Herein, we summarize the latest developments associated with analytical platforms, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology, with a focus on two terpenoid classes: monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids. Accumulated data showed that subcellular localization of both the precursor pool and the introduced enzymes were the crucial factors for increasing the production of targeted terpenoids in plants. We believe this timely review provides a glimpse of current state-of-the-art techniques/methodologies related to terpenoid engineering that would facilitate further improvements in terpenoids research.

Metabolomics for Evaluating Flavor-Associated Metabolites in Plant-Based Products,"
Plant-based diets (PBDs) are associated with environmental benefits, human health promotion and animal welfare. There is a worldwide shift towards PBDs, evident from the increased global demand for fresh plant-based products (PBPs). Such shifts in dietary preferences accompanied by evolving food palates, create opportunities to leverage technological advancements and strict quality controls in developing PBPs that can drive consumer acceptance. Flavor, color and texture are important sensory attributes of a food product and, have the largest influence on consumer appeal and acceptance. Among these, flavor is considered the most dominating quality attribute that significantly affects overall eating experience. Current state-of-art technologies rely on physicochemical estimations and sensory-based tests to assess flavor-related attributes in fresh PBPs. However, these methodologies often do not provide any indication about the metabolic features associated with unique flavor profiles and, consequently, can be used in a limited way to define the quality attributes of PBPs. To this end, a systematic understanding of metabolites that contribute to the flavor profiles of PBPs is warranted to complement the existing methodologies. This review will discuss the use of metabolomics for evaluating flavor-associated metabolites in fresh PBPs at post-harvest stage, alongside its applications for quality assessment and grading. We will summarize the current research in this area, discuss technical challenges and considerations pertaining to sampling and analytical techniques, as well as s provide future perspectives and directions for government organizations, industries and other stakeholders associated with the quality assessment of fresh PBPs.

Nerolidol: A Sesquiterpene Alcohol with Multi-Faceted Pharmacological and Biological Activities,"
Nerolidol (3,7,11-trimethyl-1,6,10-dodecatrien-3-ol) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene alcohol that is present in various plants with a floral odor. It is synthesized as an intermediate in the production of (3E)-4,8-dimethy-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), a herbivore-induced volatile that protects plants from herbivore damage. Chemically, nerolidol exists in two geometric isomers, a trans and a cis form. The usage of nerolidol is widespread across different industries. It has been widely used in cosmetics (e.g., shampoos and perfumes) and in non-cosmetic products (e.g., detergents and cleansers). In fact, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also permitted the use of nerolidol as a food flavoring agent. The fact that nerolidol is a common ingredient in many products has attracted researchers to explore more medicinal properties of nerolidol that may exert beneficial effect on human health. Therefore, the aim of this review is to compile and consolidate the data on the various pharmacological and biological activities displayed by nerolidol. Furthermore, this review also includes pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies of nerolidol. In summary, the various pharmacological and biological activities demonstrated in this review highlight the prospects of nerolidol as a promising chemical or drug candidate in the field of agriculture and medicine.

"New Insights on the Terpenome of the Red Seaweed Laurencia dendroidea (Florideophyceae, Rhodophyta)","
The red seaweeds belonging to the genus Laurencia are well known as halogenated secondary metabolites producers, mainly terpenoids and acetogennins. Several of these chemicals exhibit important ecological roles and biotechnological applications. However, knowledge regarding the genes involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds is still very limited. We detected 20 different genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid precursors, and 21 different genes coding for terpene synthases that are responsible for the chemical modifications of the terpenoid precursors, resulting in a high diversity of carbon chemical skeletons. In addition, we demonstrate through molecular and cytochemical approaches the occurrence of the mevalonate pathway involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes in L. dendroidea. This is the first report on terpene synthase genes in seaweeds, enabling further studies on possible heterologous biosynthesis of terpenes from L. dendroidea exhibiting ecological or biotechnological interest.

Patchoulol Production with Metabolically Engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum,"
Patchoulol is a sesquiterpene alcohol and an important natural product for the perfume industry. Corynebacterium glutamicum is the prominent host for the fermentative production of amino acids with an average annual production volume of ~6 million tons. Due to its robustness and well established large-scale fermentation, C. glutamicum has been engineered for the production of a number of value-added compounds including terpenoids. Both C40 and C50 carotenoids, including the industrially relevant astaxanthin, and short-chain terpenes such as the sesquiterpene valencene can be produced with this organism. In this study, systematic metabolic engineering enabled construction of a patchoulol producing C. glutamicum strain by applying the following strategies: (i) construction of a farnesyl pyrophosphate-producing platform strain by combining genomic deletions with heterologous expression of ispA from Escherichia coli; (ii) prevention of carotenoid-like byproduct formation; (iii) overproduction of limiting enzymes from the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)-pathway to increase precursor supply; and (iv) heterologous expression of the plant patchoulol synthase gene PcPS from Pogostemon cablin. Additionally, a proof of principle liter-scale fermentation with a two-phase organic overlay-culture medium system for terpenoid capture was performed. To the best of our knowledge, the patchoulol titers demonstrated here are the highest reported to date with up to 60 mg L-1 and volumetric productivities of up to 18 mg L-1 d-1.

"Pentacyclic Triterpenoids from the Medicinal Herb, Centella asiatica (L.) Urban","
Centella asiatica accumulates large quantities of pentacyclic triterpenoid saponins, collectively known as centelloids. These terpenoids include asiaticoside, centelloside, madecassoside, brahmoside, brahminoside, thankuniside, sceffoleoside, centellose, asiatic-, brahmic-, centellic- and madecassic acids. The triterpene saponins are common secondary plant metabolites and are synthesized via the isoprenoid pathway to produce a hydrophobic triterpenoid structure (aglycone) containing a hydrophilic sugar chain (glycone). The biological activity of saponins has been attributed to these characteristics. In planta, the Centella triterpenoids can be regarded as phytoanticipins due to their antimicrobial activities and protective role against attempted pathogen infections. Preparations of C. asiatica are used in traditional and alternative medicine due to the wide spectrum of pharmacological activities associated with these secondary metabolites. Here, the biosynthesis of the centelloid triterpenoids is reviewed; the range of metabolites found in C. asiatica, together with their known biological activities and the chemotype variation in the production of these metabolites due to growth conditions are summarized. These plant-derived pharmacologically active compounds have complex structures, making chemical synthesis an economically uncompetitive option. Production of secondary metabolites by cultured cells provides a particularly important benefit to manipulate and improve the production of desired compounds; thus biotechnological approaches to increase the concentrations of the metabolites are discussed.

Plant Glandular Trichomes as Targets for Breeding or Engineering of Resistance to Herbivores,"
Glandular trichomes are specialized hairs found on the surface of about 30% of all vascular plants and are responsible for a significant portion of a plant’s secondary chemistry. Glandular trichomes are an important source of essential oils, i.e., natural fragrances or products that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry, although many of these substances have evolved to provide the plant with protection against herbivores and pathogens. The storage compartment of glandular trichomes usually is located on the tip of the hair and is part of the glandular cell, or cells, which are metabolically active. Trichomes and their exudates can be harvested relatively easily, and this has permitted a detailed study of their metabolites, as well as the genes and proteins responsible for them. This knowledge now assists classical breeding programs, as well as targeted genetic engineering, aimed to optimize trichome density and physiology to facilitate customization of essential oil production or to tune biocide activity to enhance crop protection. We will provide an overview of the metabolic diversity found within plant glandular trichomes, with the emphasis on those of the Solanaceae, and of the tools available to manipulate their activities for enhancing the plant’s resistance to pests.

"Plant Volatile Organic Compounds Evolution: Transcriptional Regulation, Epigenetics and Polyploidy","
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted by plants as a consequence of their interaction with biotic and abiotic factors, and have a very important role in plant evolution. Floral VOCs are often involved in defense and pollinator attraction. These interactions often change rapidly over time, so a quick response to those changes is required. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, which regulate both genes and transcription factors, might trigger adaptive responses to these evolutionary pressures as well as regulating the rhythmic emission of VOCs through circadian clock regulation. In addition, transgenerational epigenetic effects and whole genome polyploidy could modify the generation of VOCs’ profiles of offspring, contributing to long-term evolutionary shifts. In this article, we review the available knowledge about the mechanisms that may act as epigenetic regulators of the main VOC biosynthetic pathways, and their importance in plant evolution.

Profiling of Volatile Compounds and Associated Gene Expression in Two Anthurium Cultivars and Their F1 Hybrid Progenies,"
Anthurium is an important ornamental crop in the world market and its floral scent can enhance its ornamental value. To date, studies of the components and formation mechanism of the floral scent of Anthurium are relatively few. In this study, the scent profiles of two Anthurium varieties were measured by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). There were 32 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in Anthurium ‘Mystral’, and the most abundant compound was eucalyptol (57.5%). Extremely small amounts of VOCs were detected in Anthurium ‘Alabama’. Compared with A. ‘Alabama’, most genes related to floral scent synthesis exhibited a higher expression in A.‘Mystral’, including AaDXS, AaDXR, AaMDS, AaHDS, AaTPS, AaDAHPS, AaADT2, AaPAL1, and AaPAL2. In order to produce new varieties of Anthurium with fragrance, 454 progenies of two crossbred combinations of A. ‘Mystral’ and A. ‘Alabama’ were obtained. Four F1 generation plants with different floral scent intensities were selected for further study. The major components of floral scent in the progenies were similar to that of the parental A.‘Mystral’ plant. The expression patterns of genes related to floral scent synthesis were consistent with the relative contents of different types of VOCs. This study revealed the profiles of volatile compounds and associated gene expression in two Anthurium cultivars and their F1 hybrids, which provided a basis for the floral scent inheritance of Anthurium andraeanum.

Scenarios of Genes-to-Terpenoids Network Led to the Identification of a Novel a/ß-Farnesene/ß-Ocimene Synthase in Camellia sinensis,"
Terpenoids play vital roles in tea aroma quality and plants defense performance determination, whereas the scenarios of genes to metabolites of terpenes pathway remain uninvestigated in tea plants. Here, we report the use of an integrated approach combining metabolites, target gene transcripts and function analyses to reveal a gene-to-terpene network in tea plants. Forty-one terpenes including 26 monoterpenes, 14 sesquiterpenes and one triterpene were detected and 82 terpenes related genes were identified from five tissues of tea plants. Pearson correlation analysis resulted in genes to metabolites network. One terpene synthases whose expression positively correlated with farnesene were selected and its function was confirmed involved in the biosynthesis of a-farnesene, ß-ocimene and ß-farnesene, a very important and conserved alarm pheromone in response to aphids by both in vitro enzymatic assay in planta function analysis. In summary, we provided the first reliable gene-to-terpene network for novel genes discovery.

"Secretory Products in Petals of Centaurea cyanus L. Flowers: A Histochemistry, Ultrastructure, and Phytochemical Study of Volatile Compounds","
(1) Background: Centaurea cyanus L. is a medicinal plant whose flowers are widely used in herbal medicine. The aim of the study was to localise flower tissues that are responsible for the production of secretory products in petals and to analyse the volatile compounds. The volatile compounds of the flowers of this species have not been investigated to date. (2) Methods: Light, fluorescence, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were used in the study. Lipophilic compounds were localised in the tissues using histochemical assays. Volatile compounds were determined with the use of solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). (3) Results: The study showed production of secretion in the petal parenchyma, whose ultrastructure has features of a secretory tissue. The lipophilic secretion was localised in the cells and intercellular spaces of the parenchyma and in the walls and surface of epidermal cells, where it accumulated after release through cuticle microchannels. Sesquiterpenes were found to constitute the main group of volatile compounds, with the highest content of ß-caryophyllene (26.17%) and a-humulene (9.77%). (4) Conclusions: Given the presence of some volatile components that are often found in resins (caryophyllene, delta-cadinene) and the abundant secretion residues on the epidermal surface, we suppose that the C. cyanus secretion released by the flowers is a resinaceous mixture (oleoresin), which is frequently found in plants, as shown by literature data. This secretion may play an important role in the therapeutic effects of C. cyanus flowers.

Seeing the Forest through the (Phylogenetic) Trees: Functional Characterisation of Grapevine Terpene Synthase (VviTPS) Paralogues and Orthologues,"
Gene families involved in specialised metabolism play a key role in a myriad of ecophysiological and biochemical functions. The Vitis vinifera sesquiterpene synthases represent the largest subfamily of grapevine terpene synthase (VviTPS) genes and are important volatile metabolites for wine flavour and aroma, as well as ecophysiological interactions. The functional characterisation of VviTPS genes is complicated by a reliance on a single reference genome that greatly underrepresents this large gene family, exacerbated by extensive duplications and paralogy. The recent release of multiple phased diploid grapevine genomes, as well as extensive whole-genome resequencing efforts, provide a wealth of new sequence information that can be utilised to overcome the limitations of the reference genome. A large cluster of sesquiterpene synthases, localised to chromosome 18, was explored by means of comparative sequence analyses using the publicly available grapevine reference genome, three PacBio phased diploid genomes and whole-genome resequencing data from multiple genotypes. Two genes, VviTPS04 and -10, were identified as putative paralogues and/or allelic variants. Subsequent gene isolation from multiple grapevine genotypes and characterisation by means of a heterologous in planta expression and volatile analysis resulted in the identification of genotype-specific structural variations and polymorphisms that impact the gene function. These results present novel insight into how grapevine domestication likely shaped the VviTPS landscape to result in genotype-specific functions.

"Structures, Occurrences and Biosynthesis of 11,12,13-Tri-nor-Sesquiterpenes, an Intriguing Class of Bioactive Metabolites","
The compounds 11,12,13-tri-nor-sesquiterpenes are degraded sesquiterpenoids which have lost the C3 unit of isopropyl or isopropenyl at C-7 of the sesquiterpene skeleton. The irregular C-backbone originates from the oxidative removal of a C3 side chain from the C15 sesquiterpene, which arises from farnesyl diphosphate (FDP). The C12-framework is generated, generally, in all families of sesquiterpenes by oxidative cleavage of the C3 substituent, with the simultaneous introduction of a double bond. This article reviews the isolation, biosynthesis and biological activity of this special class of sesquiterpenes, the 11,12,13-tri-nor-sesquiterpenes.

Taxonomic Insights and Its Type Cyclization Correlation of Volatile Sesquiterpenes in Vitex Species and Potential Source Insecticidal Compounds: A Review,"
Sesquiterpenes (SS) are secondary metabolites formed by the bonding of 3 isoprene (C5) units. They play an important role in the defense and signaling of plants to adapt to the environment, face stress, and communicate with the outside world, and their evolutionary history is closely related to their physiological functions. This review considers their presence and extensively summarizes the 156 sesquiterpenes identified in Vitextaxa, emphasizing those with higher concentrations and frequency among species and correlating with the insecticidal activities and defensive responses reported in the literature. In addition, we classify the SS based on their chemical structures and addresses cyclization in biosynthetic origin. Most relevant sesquiterpenes of the Vitex genus are derived from the germacredienyl cation mainly via bicyclogermacrene and germacrene C, giving rise to aromadrendanes, a skeleton with the highest number of representative compounds in this genus, and 6,9-guaiadiene, respectively, indicating the production of 1.10-cyclizing sesquiterpene synthases. These enzymes can play an important role in the chemosystematics of the genus from their corresponding routes and cyclizations, constituting a new approach to chemotaxonomy. In conclusion, this review is a compilation of detailed information on the profile of sesquiterpene in the Vitex genus and, thus, points to new unexplored horizons for future research.

Terpenes and Terpenoids in Plants: Interactions with Environment and Insects,"
The interactions of plants with environment and insects are bi-directional and dynamic. Consequently, a myriad of mechanisms has evolved to engage organisms in different types of interactions. These interactions can be mediated by allelochemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which include volatile terpenes (VTs). The emission of VTs provides a way for plants to communicate with the environment, including neighboring plants, beneficiaries (e.g., pollinators, seed dispersers), predators, parasitoids, and herbivores, by sending enticing or deterring signals. Understanding terpenoid distribution, biogenesis, and function provides an opportunity for the design and implementation of effective and efficient environmental calamity and pest management strategies. This review provides an overview of plant–environment and plant–insect interactions in the context of terpenes and terpenoids as important chemical mediators of these abiotic and biotic interactions.

Structure of 2-Methylisoborneol Synthase from Streptomyces coelicolor and Implications for the Cyclization of a Noncanonical C-Methylated Monoterpenoid Substrate,"The crystal structure of 2-methylisoborneol synthase (MIBS) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) has been determined in complex with substrate analogues geranyl-S-thiolodiphosphate and 2-fluorogeranyl diphosphate at 1.80 and 1.95 Å resolution, respectively. This terpenoid cyclase catalyzes the cyclization of the naturally occurring, noncanonical C-methylated isoprenoid substrate, 2-methylgeranyl diphosphate, to form the bicyclic product 2-methylisoborneol, a volatile C11 homoterpene alcohol with an earthy, musty odor. While MIBS adopts the tertiary structure of a class I terpenoid cyclase, its dimeric quaternary structure differs from that previously observed in dimeric terpenoid cyclases from plants and fungi. The quaternary structure of MIBS is nonetheless similar in some respects to that of dimeric farnesyl diphosphate synthase, which is not a cyclase. The structures of MIBS complexed with substrate analogues provide insights regarding differences in the catalytic mechanism of MIBS and the mechanisms of (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase and endo-fenchol synthase, plant cyclases that convert geranyl diphosphate into products with closely related bicyclic bornyl skeletons, but distinct structures and stereochemistries."
Terpenoids: Opportunities for Biosynthesis of Natural Product Drugs Using Engineered Microorganisms,"Terpenoids represent a diverse class of molecules that provide a wealth of opportunities to address many human health and societal issues. The expansive array of structures and functionalities that have been evolved in nature provide an excellent pool of molecules for use in human therapeutics. While this class of molecules has members with therapeutic properties including anticancer, antiparasitic, antimicrobial, antiallergenic, antispasmodic, antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, supply limitations prevent the large scale use of some molecules. Many of these molecules are only found in ppm levels in nature thus requiring massive harvesting to obtain sufficient amounts of the drug. Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering provide innovative approaches to increase the production of the desired molecule in the native organism, and most importantly, transfer the biosynthetic pathways to other hosts. Microbial systems are well studied, and genetic manipulations allow the optimization of microbial metabolisms for the production of common terpenoid precursors. Using a host of tools, unprecedented advancements in the large scale production of terpenoids have been achieved in recent years. Identification of limiting steps and pathway regulation, coupled with design strategies to minimize terpenoid byproducts wih a high flux to the desired biosynthetic pathways, have yielded greater than 100-fold improvements in the production of a range of terpenoids. This review focuses on the biodiversity of terpenoids, the biosynthetic pathways involved, and engineering efforts to maximize the production through these pathways."
A Genome-Wide Scenario of Terpene Pathways in Self-pollinated Artemisia annua,"Abstract

Scenarios of genes to metabolites in Artemisia annua remain uninvestigated. Here, we report the use of an integrated approach combining metabolomics, transcriptomics, and gene function analyses to characterize gene-to-terpene and terpene pathway scenarios in a self-pollinating variety of this species. Eighty-eight metabolites including 22 sesquiterpenes (e.g., artemisinin), 26 monoterpenes, two triterpenes, one diterpene and 38 other non-polar metabolites were identified from 14 tissues. These metabolites were differentially produced by leaves and flowers at lower to higher positions. Sequences from cDNA libraries of six tissues were assembled into 18 871 contigs and genome-wide gene expression profiles in tissues were strongly associated with developmental stages and spatial specificities. Sequence mining identified 47 genes that mapped to the artemisinin, non-amorphadiene sesquiterpene, monoterpene, triterpene, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate and mevalonate pathways. Pearson correlation analysis resulted in network integration that characterized significant correlations of gene-to-gene expression patterns and gene expression-to-metabolite levels in six tissues simultaneously. More importantly, manipulations of amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene expression not only affected the activity of this pathway toward artemisinin, artemisinic acid, and arteannuin b but also altered non-amorphadiene sesquiterpene and genome-wide volatile profiles. Such gene-to-terpene landscapes associated with different tissues are fundamental to the metabolic engineering of artemisinin."
A monoterpene synthase gene cluster of tea plant (Camellia sinensis) potentially involved in constitutive and herbivore-induced terpene formation,"Abstract

Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the most abundant volatiles in tea plants and have dual functions in aroma quality formation and defense responses in tea plants. Terpene synthases (TPS) are the key enzymes for the synthesis of terpenes in plants; however, the functions of most of them in tea plants are still unknown. In this study, six putative terpene biosynthesis gene clusters were identified from the tea plant genome. Then we cloned three new TPS-b subfamily genes, CsTPS08, CsTPS10 and CsTPS58. In vitro enzyme assays showed that CsTPS08 and CsTPS58 are two multiple-product terpene synthases, with the former synthesizing linalool as the main product, and ß-myrcene, a-phellandrene, a-terpinolene, D-limonene, cis-ß-ocimene, trans-ß-ocimene and (4E,6Z)-allo-ocimene as minor products are also detected, while the latter catalyzing the formation of a-pinene and D-limonene using GPP as the substrate. No product of CsTPS10 was detected in the prokaryotic expression system, but geraniol production was detected when transiently expressed in tobacco leaves. CsTPS08 and CsTPS10 are two functional members of a monoterpene synthase gene cluster, which were significantly induced during both Ectropis oblique feeding and fresh leaf spreading treatments, suggesting that they have dual functions involved in tea plant pest defense and tea aroma quality regulation. In addition, the differences in their expression levels in different tea plant cultivars provide a possibility for the subsequent screening of tea plant resources with a specific aroma flavor. Our results deepen the understanding of terpenoid synthesis in tea plants."
A raison d’être for two distinct pathways in the early steps of plant isoprenoid biosynthesis?,"Abstract

When compared to other organisms, plants are atypical with respect to isoprenoid biosynthesis: they utilize two distinct and separately compartmentalized pathways to build up isoprene units. The co-existence of these pathways in the cytosol and in plastids might permit the synthesis of many vital compounds, being essential for a sessile organism. While substrate exchange across membranes has been shown for a variety of plant species, lack of complementation of strong phenotypes, resulting from inactivation of either the cytosolic pathway (growth and development defects) or the plastidial pathway (pigment bleaching), seems to be surprising at first sight. Hundreds of isoprenoids have been analyzed to determine their biosynthetic origins. It can be concluded that in angiosperms, under standard growth conditions, C20-phytyl moieties, C30-triterpenes and C40-carotenoids are made nearly exclusively within compartmentalized pathways, while mixed origins are widespread for other types of isoprenoid-derived molecules. It seems likely that this coexistence is essential for the interaction of plants with their environment. A major purpose of this review is to summarize such observations, especially within an ecological and functional context and with some emphasis on regulation. This latter aspect still requires more work and present conclusions are preliminary, although some general features seem to exist."
A review on microbial synthesis of hydrocarbons,"Abstract

Review summarizes comparative data on the intracellular hydrocarbons of different microorganisms (cyanobacteria, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and mycelial fungi). Certain systematic groups of microorganisms are characterized by specific composition of intracellular hydrocarbons, in particular, cyanobacteria are unique in their ability to produce 7- and 8-methylheptadecanes; photosynthetic bacteria are distinguished by the synthesis of cyclic hydrocarbons (pristane and phytane), whereas in fungi, long-chain hydrocarbons are predominant. The synthesis of hydrocarbons by microorganisms depends considerably on the growth conditions that provides a way for its physiological regulation. The processes for microbiological production of extracellular aliphatic and volatile non-methane hydrocarbons are exemplified. Pathways for the biosynthesis of straight chain-, branched-, volatile non-methane hydrocarbons, and isoprenoids are described. Mechanisms of the hydrocarbon synthesis appear to be different in various microorganisms. The role of hydrocarbons in microorganisms is discussed."
"Advances in biosynthesis, regulation, and metabolic engineering of plant specialized terpenoids","Abstract

Plant specialized terpenoids are natural products that have no obvious role in growth and development, but play many important functional roles to improve the plant’s overall fitness. Besides, plant specialized terpenoids have immense value to humans due to their applications in fragrance, flavor, cosmetic, and biofuel industries. Understanding the fundamental aspects involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of these high-value molecules in plants not only paves the path to enhance plant traits, but also facilitates homologous or heterologous engineering for overproduction of target molecules of importance. Recent developments in functional genomics and high-throughput analytical techniques have led to unraveling of several novel aspects involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of plant specialized terpenoids. The knowledge thus derived has been successfully utilized to produce target specialized terpenoids of plant origin in homologous or heterologous host systems by metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches. Here, we provide an overview and highlights on advances related to the biosynthetic steps, regulation, and metabolic engineering of plant specialized terpenoids."
Alternative Carbon Sources for Isoprene Emission,"Isoprene and other plastidial isoprenoids are produced primarily from recently assimilated photosynthates via the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. However, when environmental conditions limit photosynthesis, a fraction of carbon for MEP pathway can come from extrachloroplastic sources. The flow of extrachloroplastic carbon depends on the species and on leaf developmental and environmental conditions. The exchange of common phosphorylated intermediates between the MEP pathway and other metabolic pathways can occur via plastidic phosphate translocators. C1 and C2 carbon intermediates can contribute to chloroplastic metabolism, including photosynthesis and isoprenoid synthesis. Integration of these metabolic processes provide an example of metabolic flexibility, and results in the synthesis of primary metabolites for plant growth and secondary metabolites for plant defense, allowing effective use of environmental resources under multiple stresses."
Analysis of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids,"Abstract

One of the most diverse and significant terpenoid subdivisions in plants is sesquiterpenoids. In addition to playing physiological roles, they show considerable biological and physicochemical properties making them suitable to be used for cosmetic, medicinal, and agrochemical purposes. To this end, phytochemical analysis contributes fundamentally to the novel biodiscovery. Technological progress and enhanced equipment have been applied for small terpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, not to mention approaches and concepts in the methodological area with respect to the analysis and chemistry of natural products. This chapter is an effort to address advanced extraction methods for isolating, identifying, and quantifying sesquiterpenoids and sesquiterpenes in plant sources."
Aphid alarm pheromone: An overview of current knowledge on biosynthesis and functions,"Abstract

Aphids are important agricultural and forest pests that exhibit complex behaviors elicited by pheromonal signals. The aphid alarm pheromone – of which (E)-ß-farnesene is the key (or only) component in most species – plays important roles in mediating interactions among individuals as well as multitrophic interactions among plants, aphids, and aphid natural enemies. Though many important questions remain to be answered, a large body of research has addressed various aspects of the biology, physiology, and ecology of aphid alarm pheromones. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of (a) the identity and composition of aphid alarm signals; (b) their biosynthesis and production; (c) their effects on conspecifics; (d) their role as cues for other insect species; and (e) their potential application for the management of pest organisms."
Application of LC–MS and LC–NMR Techniques for Secondary Metabolite Identification,"Abstract

An overview of advancements and applications of liquid chromatography coupled to nuclear magnetic resonance (LC–NMR) is given and discussed for secondary metabolites in the plant kingdom: terpenoids, alkaloids and phenolic compounds. The different LC–NMR operating modes are presented in order to structure compound elucidation. On-flow and stop-flow modes are described, together with technical improvements such as LC–SPE–NMR and capLC–NMR. Synergetic combination of hyphenated techniques coupled to mass spectrometry and NMR is illustrated and discussed with an example."
Artemisinin biosynthesis in growing plants of Artemisia annua. A 13CO2 study,"Abstract

Artemisinin from Artemisia annua has become one of the most important drugs for malaria therapy. Its biosynthesis proceeds via amorpha-4,11-diene, but it is still unknown whether the isoprenoid precursors units are obtained by the mevalonate pathway or the more recently discovered non-mevalonate pathway. In order to address that question, a plant of A. annua was grown in an atmosphere containing 700 ppm of 13CO2 for 100 min. Following a chase period of 10 days, artemisinin was isolated and analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The isotopologue pattern shows that artemisinin was predominantly biosynthesized from (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) whose central isoprenoid unit had been obtained via the non-mevalonate pathway. The isotopologue data confirm the previously proposed mechanisms for the cyclization of (E,E)-FPP to amorphadiene and its oxidative conversion to artemisinin. They also support deprotonation of a terminal allyl cation intermediate as the final step in the enzymatic conversion of FPP to amorphadiene and show that either of the two methyl groups can undergo deprotonation."
Attracting friends to feast on foes: engineering terpene emission to make crop plants more attractive to herbivore enemies,"Abstract

When attacked by herbivorous insects or mites, some plant species call on other arthropods for help. They emit mixtures of volatile compounds, dominated by terpenes, to attract carnivorous arthropods that prey on or parasitise herbivores and so reduce further damage. This fascinating defence strategy offers a new, environmentally friendly approach to crop protection. Using recent advances in the biochemistry and molecular genetics of terpene biosynthesis, it should now be possible to engineer crop plants that release terpenes for attracting herbivore enemies. By introducing or selectively altering the existing rate of terpene emission and composition, plant breeders could enable attacked plants to attract enemies and reduce additional herbivory, without compromising the effectiveness of other modes of defence."
Biochemical and functional characterization of two microbial type terpene synthases from moss Stereodon subimponens,"Abstract

Terpenes constitute a large class of plant secondary metabolites. Usually, there is only one type of terpene synthase in seed plants, which is called typical plant terpene synthase. Currently, as a new family of plant terpene synthases, microbial terpene synthase-like (MTPSL) is identificated in nonseed plants. However, our knowledge about the biological function of most MTPSLs in nonseed plants is very limited. Here, we investigated the biochemical and functional characterization of the enzymes encoded by two MTPSLs from moss Stereodon subimponens, SsMTPSL1 and SsMTPSL2. A phylogenetic tree analysis showed that SsMTPSL1 and SsMTPSL2 are homologous to AaMTPSL1, AaMTPSL3, ApMTPSL1, and ApMTPSL3 from hornworts. The enzyme activity experiment demonstrated that SsMTPSL1 has monoterpene synthase and sesquiterpene synthase activity, and SsMTPSL2 has monoterpene synthase activity. Next, we selected SsMTPSL1 to study its biochemical functions. Anti-bacterial activity test in vitro showed that the products of SsMTPSL1 have an anti-bacterial effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000), and Staphylococcus aureus. To further understand the function of SsMTPSL1, the transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plant of SsMTPSL1 is inoculated by Pst DC3000, and the result showed that SsMTPSL1 enhances the resistance of A. thaliana to Pst DC3000. All in all, this study provides new information about the functions of moss MTPSLs."
Biochemistry of Terpenoids,"Publisher Summary

Terpenes are diverse group of compounds, and are found in complex mixtures. They are lipids and frequently unstable. New techniques for purifying and analyzing natural products and determining structures, as well as improved techniques in plant enzymology, have produced rapid progress in this field recently. The facts that many of the enzymes of terpene metabolism are membrane-bound and that the terpenes themselves are hydrophobic, still present problems, and demand new advances in methodology. It has been a common assumption that secondary products are end products of sluggish metabolic pathways. As a result, tracer experiments have often involved incorporation periods from 24 hours to several days. However, results indicate that terpene metabolism in plants is much more dynamic and synthesis and turnover might occur within minutes. A full understanding of the biochemistry of terpenoids in plants requires an interdisciplinary effort, combining organic chemistry, bio-chemistry, plant physiology, plant anatomy, and the applied sciences. The conventional segregation of scientific disciplines has been one of the factors impeding progress in this area."
"Biogenesis, molecular regulation and function of plant isoprenoids","Abstract

Isoprenoids represent the oldest class of known low molecular-mass natural products synthesized by plants. Their biogenesis in plastids, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum–cytosol proceed invariably from the C5 building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate and/or dimethylallyl diphosphate according to complex and reiterated mechanisms. Compounds derived from the pathway exhibit a diverse spectrum of biological functions. This review centers on advances obtained in the field based on combined use of biochemical, molecular biology and genetic approaches. The function and evolutionary implications of this metabolism are discussed in relation with seminal informations gathered from distantly but related organisms."
Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds and Their Impacts on Biosphere–Atmosphere Interactions,"Abstract

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) play a critical role in biosphere–atmosphere interactions and are key constraints of the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere, potentially influencing the climate and the quality of air, especially in the areas exposed to in situ release or long-range transport of anthropogenically polluted air masses. Under these conditions, reactive BVOC may contribute to ozone and particle production. The very large amount of BVOC emitted by vegetation, estimated today to more than 1000 Tg C annually, is dominated by methanol and isoprenoids, released predominantly by forest species. Such a high rate of emission implies a large metabolic cost and hence likely indicates very important plant functional roles for these compounds. BVOC can be emitted by plants constitutively, or the emission may be induced in response to biotic and abiotic factors. Both constitutive and induced isoprenoids often act as defensive compounds and are crucial for plant protection in stressful environments. The importance of volatile isoprenoids as protecting molecules has been widely discussed. However, based on the use of genetically modified plants and novel technologies that allow detection of BVOC oxidation products, the idea is emerging that especially volatile isoprenoids act as antioxidants in planta, whereas they contribute to the oxidation potential of the atmosphere."
Biogenic volatile organic compounds in different ecosystems in Southern Kenya,"Abstract

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) have an important impact on atmospheric chemistry. Mixing ratio of BVOCs in different ecosystems have been measured and discussed in detail in recent decades. However, field measurements from tropical Africa remain scarce. In this study, we present the mixing ratio of BVOCs, including isoprene, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenes, bornylacetate, and 2–methyl–3–buten–2–ol from typical forests, bushlands, grasslands and agricultural ecosystems in Taita Taveta County, southern Kenya. The measurements were conducted in April 2019 during the end of the dry season. The total BVOC mixing ratios in forest, agricultural, bushland and grassland ecosystems were 913 ± 183 pptv, 1094 ± 179 pptv, 751 ± 47 pptv and 886 ± 95 pptv, respectively. Isoprene represented 76%, 86%, 91% and 85%, respectively, of total mixing ratios. Monoterpenoids represented in 23%, 14%, 8% and 14% of total mixing ratios, respectively. Monoterpenoid have strong effect on the total BVOC mixing ratios, especially at the certain landscape (i.e. wattletree, pine and cypress forest, and dry grassland). The monoterpenoids were dominated by a–pinene, limonene and ß–pinene in all of the ecosystems. Linalool was found in a relative high mixing ratio from all lowland samples, which was likely responding to the lower soil moisture."
Biosynthesis of andrographolide in Andrographis paniculata,"Abstract

Andrographolide, a diterpene lactone, is isolated from Andrographis paniculata which is well known for its medicinal properties. The biosynthetic route to andrographolide was studied using [1-13C]acetate, [2-13C]acetate and [1,6-13C2]glucose. The peak enrichment of eight carbon atoms in the 13C NMR spectra of andrographolide suggested that deoxyxylulose pathway (DXP) is the major biosynthetic pathway to this diterpene.

The contribution of the mevalonic acid pathway (MVA) is indicated by the observed 13C-labeling pattern, and because the labeling patterns indicate a simultaneous contribution of both methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) and MVA pathways it can be deduced that cross-talk occurs between plastids and cytoplasm."
Biosynthesis of mono- and sesquiterpenes in carrot roots and leaves (Daucus carota L.): metabolic cross talk of cytosolic mevalonate and plastidial methylerythritol phosphate pathways,"Abstract

The biosynthesis of the monoterpenes terpinolene and myrcene and the sesquiterpene ß-caryophyllene in roots and leaves of two carrot varieties (Daucus carota L. cultivars Bolero and Kazan) were investigated by in vivo feeding experiments with [5,5-2H2]-mevalonic acid lactone (d2-MVL) and [5,5-2H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose (d2-DOX). The volatiles of the tissues were extracted by stir bar sorptive extraction and analyzed using thermal desorption–multidimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The experiments demonstrate independent de novo-biosynthesis of terpenoids in carrot roots and in carrot leaves. In both plant tissues monoterpenes are biosynthesized exclusively via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose/2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathway, whereas sesquiterpenes are generated by the classical mevalonic acid pathway as well as by the DOXP/MEP route. A more detailed investigation of carrot root tissues revealed that the biosynthesis of terpenes is mainly localized in the phloem. Nevertheless, in xylem a de novo-biosynthesis of terpenes was detectable as well, even in the absence of oil ducts in this tissue."
"Biosynthesis of the irregular monoterpene artemisia ketone, the sesquiterpene germacrene D and other isoprenoids in Tanacetum vulgare L. (Asteraceae)","Abstract

The incorporation of [1-13C]-labeled glucose into the irregular monoterpene artemisia ketone, the regular monoterpenes camphor and ß-thujone, the sesquiterpene germacrene D, the diterpene trans-phytol and ß-sitosterol and isofucosterol has been studied in axenic cultures of Tanacetum vulgare L. (Asteraceae).

Quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis of the resulting labeling patterns showed that the isoprene units of the monoterpenes and the diterpene are formed via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, whereas the isoprene building blocks of the sesquiterpene and the sterols originate from the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway."
Biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene germacrene D in Solidago canadensis: 13C and 2H labeling studies,"Abstract

The biogenetic origin of the isoprenoid building blocks of the sesquiterpene germacrene D was studied in Solidago canadensis. Feeding experiments were carried out with 1-[5,5-d2]deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (D2-DOXP), [5-13C]mevalonolactone (13C-MVL) and [1-13C]-d-glucose. The hydrodistillate of a cut shoot fed with D2-DOXP was investigated by enantio-MDGC–MS and the volatile fraction of a shoot supplied with 13C-MVL was examined by GC–C–IRMS. The incorporation of [1-13C]-d-glucose was analyzed by quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy after isolation of germacrene D from the essential oil. Our labeling studies revealed that the biosynthesis of the C-15 skeleton of sesquiterpene germacrene D in Solidago canadensis proceeds predominantly via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway."
"Biosynthesis of ß-caryophyllene, a novel terpene-based high-density biofuel precursor, using engineered Escherichia coli","Abstract

ß-caryophyllene is a common sesquiterpene compound currently being studied as a promising precursor for the production of high-density fuels. Acute demand for high-density fuels has provided the impetus to pursue biosynthetic methods to produce ß-caryophyllene from reproducible sources. In this study, we produced ß-caryophyllene by assembling a biosynthetic pathway in an engineered Escherichia coli strain of which phosphoglucose isomerase gene has been deleted. The 1- deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) or heterologous mevalonate (MVA) pathways were employed. Meanwhile, geranyl diphosphate synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ß-caryophyllene synthase genes were co-overexpressed in the above strain. The final genetically modified strain, YJM59, produced 220 ± 6 mg/L of ß-caryophyllene in flask culture. We also evaluated the use of fed-batch fermentation for the production of ß-caryophyllene. After induction for 60 h, the YJM59 strain produced ß-caryophyllene at a concentration of 1520 mg/L. The volumetric production fermented in the aerobic fed-batch was 0.34 mg/(L·h·OD600) and the conversion efficiency of glucose to ß-caryophyllene (gram to gram) was 1.69%. Our results are the first successful attempt to produce ß-caryophyllene using E. coli BL21(DE3), and provide a new strategy that is green and sustainable for the production of ß-caryophyllene."
Biosynthetic potential of sesquiterpene synthases: Alternative products of tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase,"Abstract

Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (TEAS) serves as an useful model for understanding the enzyme mechanisms of sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Despite extensive bio-chemical and structural characterization of TEAS, a more detailed analysis of the reaction product spectrum is lacking. This study reports the discovery and quantification of several alternative sesquiterpene products generated by recombinant TEAS in the single-vial GC–MS assay. The combined use of chiral and non-polar stationary phases for gas chromatography separations proved critical for resolving the numerous sesquiterpene products of TEAS for mass spectral analysis and identification. Co-injection studies with available authentic standards from both synthetic and natural sources further corroborated the assignment of several compounds, resulting in an annotated reaction mechanism accounting for their biosynthesis. Moreover, a previously undocumented farnesyl trans–cis isomerization pathway was observed."
Both methylerythritol phosphate and mevalonate pathways contribute to biosynthesis of each of the major isoprenoid classes in young cotton seedlings,"Abstract

In higher plants, both the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and mevalonate (MVA) pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. However, despite a significant amount of research on the activity of these pathways under different conditions, the relative contribution of each to the biosynthesis of diverse isoprenoids remains unclear. In this work, we examined the formation of several classes of isoprenoids in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). After feeding [5,5-2H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose ([5,5-2H2]DOX) and [2-13C]MVA to intact cotton seedlings hydroponically, incorporation into isoprenoids was analyzed by MS and NMR. The predominant pattern of incorporation followed the classical scheme in which C5 units from the MEP pathway were used to form monoterpenes (C10), phytol side chains (C20) and carotenoids (C40) while C5 units from the MVA pathway were used to form sesquiterpenes (C15), terpenoid aldehydes (C15 and C25) and steroids/triterpenoids (C30). However, both pathways contributed to all classes of terpenoids, sometimes substantially. For example, the MEP pathway provided up to 20% of the substrate for sterols and the MVA pathway provided as much as 50% of the substrate for phytol side chains and carotenoids. Incorporation of C5 units from the MEP pathway was highest in cotyledons, compared to true leaves, and not observed at all in the roots. Incorporation of C5 units from the MVA pathway was highest in the roots (into sterols) and more prominent in the first true leaves than in other above-ground organs. The relative accumulation of label in intermediates vs. end products of phytosterol metabolism confirmed previous identification of slow steps in this pathway."
C6-Green leaf volatiles trigger local and systemic VOC emissions in tomato,"Abstract

In response to insect feeding, tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) release elevated levels of volatile organic compounds; that is, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are released both locally and systemically with wounding while C6 green leaf volatiles are released only from damaged leaves. With the exogenous application (100 nmol) of the C6-tomato-volatile (E)-2-hexenal, an increase in the release of local and systemic terpenes was observed, while an equimolar amount of methyl jasmonate triggered only local emissions of terpenes. Labeling studies with 13CO2 showed that de novo synthesis was not required for monoterpene or sesquiterpene release immediately following chemical treatment or insect feeding. Comparative measurements were made between aldehyde doses applied to the plant and levels naturally released from leaves with insect damage."
"Carotenoid biofortification in crop plants: citius, altius, fortius","Abstract

Carotenoids are indispensable for human health, required as precursors of vitamin A and efficient antioxidants. However, these plant pigments that play a vital role in photosynthesis are represented at insufficient levels in edible parts of several crops, which creates a need for increasing their content or optimizing their composition through biofortification. In particular, vitamin A deficiency, a severe health problem affecting the lives of millions in developing countries, has triggered the development of a series of high-provitamin A crops, including Golden Rice as the best-known example. Further carotenoid-biofortified crops have been generated by using genetic engineering approaches or through classical breeding. In this review, we depict carotenoid metabolism in plants and provide an update on the development of carotenoid-biofortified plants and their potential to meet needs and expectations. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of using natural variation for carotenoid biofortification and the potential of gene editing tools. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Carotenoids recent advances in cell and molecular biology edited by Johannes von Lintig and Loredana Quadro."
"cDNA Cloning, Characterization, and Functional Expression of Four New Monoterpene Synthase Members of the Tpsd Gene Family from Grand Fir (Abies grandis)","Abstract

Grand fir (Abies grandis) is a useful model system for studying the biochemistry, molecular genetics, and regulation of defensive oleoresin formation in conifers, a process involving both the constitutive accumulation of resin (pitch) in specialized secretory structures and the induced biosynthesis of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (turpentine) and diterpene resin acids (rosin) by nonspecialized cells at the site of injury. A similarity-based cloning strategy, employing primers designed to conserved regions of existing monoterpene synthases and anticipated to amplify a 1000-bp fragment, unexpectedly yielded a 300-bp fragment with sequence reminiscent of a terpenoid synthase. Utilization of this amplicon as a hybridization probe afforded four new, full-length cDNA species from a wounded fir stem cDNA library that appeared to encode four distinct monoterpene synthases. Expression in Escherichia coli, followed by enzyme assay with geranyl diphosphate (C10), farnesyl diphosphate (C15) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C20), and analysis of the terpene products by chiral phase gas chromatography and mass spectrometry confirmed that these sequences encoded four new monoterpene synthases, including (-)-camphene synthase, (-)-ß-phellandrene synthase, terpinolene synthase, and an enzyme that produces both (-)-limonene and (-)-a-pinene. The deduced amino acid sequences indicated these enzymes to be 618 to 637 residues in length (71 to 73 kDa) and to be translated as preproteins bearing an amino-terminal plastid targeting sequence of 50–60 residues. cDNA truncation to delete the transit peptide allowed functional expression of the “pseudomature” forms of these enzymes, which exhibited no change in product outcome as a result of truncation. Sequence comparison revealed that these new monoterpene synthases from grand fir are members of the Tpsd gene subfamily and resemble sesquiterpene (C15) synthases and diterpene (C20) synthases from conifers more closely than mechanistically related monoterpene synthases from angiosperm species. The availability of a nearly complete set of constitutive and inducible monoterpene synthases from grand fir (now numbering seven) will allow molecular dissection of the resin-based defense response in this conifer species, and detailed study of structure–function relationships among this large and diverse family of catalysts, all of which exploit the same stereochemistry in the coupled isomerization–cyclization reaction."
"cDNA cloning, prokaryotic expression and functional analysis of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in Pogostemon cablin","Abstract

Pogostemon cablin is an important commercial source of patchouli oil, whose main active ingredient is patchouli alcohol. This sesquiterpene is a product of the mevalonate pathway, in which 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) is the rate-limiting enzyme. In this study, P. cablin HMGCR cDNA, comprising 2209 nucleotides encoding 425 amino acid residues was isolated, and bioinformatics analysis was used to analyze the protein sequence. Based on this analysis, a C-terminal truncated variant was engineered for recombinant expression in E. coli. The 38?kDa recombinant protein was identified by SDS-PAGE, and assayed for mevalonolactone production. According to the PcHMGCR1 gene sequence alignment with other species, the HMGCR protein had obvious resemblance with other plants HMG coenzyme A reductase and had homology with other species including plants, fungi, archaebacteria and animals. The prokaryotic expression vector was constructed by restriction enzyme digestion to be transformed into E. coli to express the recombinant protein, and 38?kDa recombinant protein was identified by the SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic activity was detected using GC-MS and, as a result, mevalonolactone was detected in the in vitro reaction mixture. Differential expression analysis showed that PcHMGCR1 expressed the highest amount in roots. The research results are of great significance for further research on the molecular biosynthesis mechanism of Patchouli alcohol in P. cablin."
Chapter 1 Aroma Volatiles,"Abstract

Flavor composition has been defined as a complex attribute of quality, in which the mix of sugars, acids, and volatiles play a primary role. In addition to the four basic flavors (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) that humans can recognize in fruits and vegetables, aroma has an important influence on the final consumer acceptance of the commodity. Fruit aroma is determined by a complex mixture of a large number of volatile compounds including alcohols, aldehydes, and esters. During fruit development, especially at ripening, there are many changes of these metabolites caused by their synthesis, transport or degradation. In terms of volatile biosynthesis, several studies have been performed identifying and characterizing the most important genes and encoded enzymes involved in aroma-related volatiles; however, research in the mechanisms of regulation or modulation is still limited. To have an updated overview about aroma biosynthesis in fruit species, the main objective of this manuscript was to review the recent advances in this topic, mainly in terms of the new insights in volatile characterization, gene identification, and regulation of aroma during fruit ripening."
Chapter 14 Plant Volatiles in Defence,"Abstract

Plant odours are the most ubiquitous volatiles in nature. This chapter deals with the biochemistry and molecular biology of plant volatiles that are emitted from vegetative tissues during pathogen- or herbivore-induced stress and the contribution of these volatiles to plant defences. While mechanical tissue wounding causes the non-specific release of volatiles, herbivore-specific elicitors from their saliva distinctly alter the volatile signature. These volatiles acquired diverse roles in ecological interactions. Firstly, they can be toxic to, or repel conspecific or other herbivores from already infested plants. This function is referred to as ‘direct defence’. Secondly, volatiles function as prey-associated signals for foraging carnivorous arthropods. This is referred to as ‘indirect defence’. Finally, volatiles elicit metabolic changes in unattacked neighbouring plants resulting in priming and induction of defences already before herbivores have arrived. This is referred to as ‘plant–plant communication’. Although volatile production by native plants and crops is highly variable under different growth conditions and during development, its function in direct and indirect defences is remarkably robust. With the current state of knowledge, it is now possible to manipulate these direct and indirect defences through breeding or transgenic approaches. Taken together, plant volatiles play profound roles in plant–herbivore and plant–pathogen interactions and are promising targets for improved crop protection."
"Chapter one Arabidopsis thaliana, a model system for investigating volatile terpene biosynthesis, regulation, and function","Summary

Plants use volatile compounds in general, and terpenes in particular, to attract pollinators to their flowers and to ward off, directly or indirectly, harmful insect, animal, and microbial pests. We have shown that the Arabidopsis model system is as useful for the study of terpene biosynthesis and emission as it is for so many other areas of plant biology. The availability of the sequence of the entire Arabidopsis genome has allowed us to identify the complete TPS gene family, and to begin to correlate the emission of specific terpenes with the expression of specific AtTPS genes. With the modern tools available for experimentation in Arabidopsis, this model organism constitutes the best system to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the processes of plant-insect interaction via volatiles, which operate in both the vegetative and the reproductive parts of the plants."
Chapter ten The chemical wizardry of isoprenoid metabolism in plants,"Publisher Summary

This chapter provides general appreciation for some of the exciting research at several different levels in the field of terpene and isoprenoid metabolism in plants. The structural variety of terpenes is elaborated by subsequent modifications to the cyclic scaffolds or backbones by hydroxylations, methylations, demethylations, halogenations, oxidations, and possibly even glycosylations. Biologists use the tools of molecular genetics to define the contribution of isoprenoids to the ability of plants to interact with their environment. The chapter discusses that molecular biologists and geneticists are determining mechanisms regulating the expression of this biosynthetic machinery, and biochemists are elucidating structure–function relationships for key enzymes in the pathway. Bringing this array of information back together and using it for the creation of novel terpenes having unique biological roles is clearly one of the next great challenges in the field. This includes the development of designer enzymes, the coupling of enzymes in novel ways (physically and biochemically), and expressing de novo isoprenoid pathways in transgenic microbes and plants."
Characterization of Coffee Genes Involved in Isoprenoid and Diterpene Metabolic Pathways,"Abstract

Studies aiming to improve cup quality are important to the coffee agrobusiness. Isoprenoids and diterpenes are biochemical compounds related to plant defense mechanisms, health-related properties, and sensorial properties of coffee. Two diterpenes are exclusively found in coffee plants: cafestol (CAF) and kahweol (KAH). The final steps of CAF and KAH biosynthesis have not yet been elucidated. To understand these metabolic pathways and the accumulation/degradation of these compounds, we are integrating biochemical (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and molecular data (RNA sequencing) to find candidate genes that follow the same patterns in both analysis. We identified 24 putative genes, some of which showed an expression pattern similar to HPLC (CAF/KAH) quantification profiles. These data can provide important information on key genes related to the metabolic pathways of isoprenoids and diterpenes and direct future analysis."
Characterization of three linalool synthase genes from Citrus unshiu Marc. and analysis of linalool-mediated resistance against Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri and Penicilium italicum in citrus leaves and fruits,"Abstract

Three cDNA clones from Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.) were isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli. CuSTS3-1 and CuSTS3-2 encode linalool synthases and CuSTS4 encodes a nerolidol/linalool synthase. Transcripts of CuSTS3-1, CuSTS3-2 and CuSTS4 were abundant in young fruit at 60 days after flowering (DAF), flowers and leaves, respectively. Treatments with Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (XCC), the causal agent of citrus canker and Penicillium italicum (PI), the cause of post-harvest fruit decay, and wounding up-regulated CuSTS3-1 in fruit and mainly CuSTS4 in leaves. Linalool, citral, geraniol and citronellol showed strong antibacterial and antifungal activities against XCC and PI in vitro, while most other mono-and sesquiterpenes, including limonene and gamma-terpinene, did not. Linalool, used at levels similar to those present in resistant Ponkan mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) leaves, was able to inhibit growth of XCC in vitro. Compared to other five citrus types, linalool accumulated at extraordinarily high levels in Ponkan mandarin leaves and was released at high amounts from their leaves, while it was hardly detectable in the most susceptible species, indicating that linalool biosynthesis and accumulation might be involved in plant defense against bacterial and fungal pathogens and be associated with field resistance to citrus canker."
Chemistry of Essential Oils and Factors Influencing Their Constituents,"Abstract

Medicinal plants are the most popular forms of traditional plants used to maintain health, as well as prevent or treat physical and mental disorders. Chemical compounds of plants are classified into primary metabolites and secondary metabolites. Plants produce a great variety of secondary metabolites related to the mechanisms of adaptation and important in mediating interactions between plants and the biotic environment. Among secondary metabolites, essential oils (EOs) are very important natural products, which have different therapeutic and biological activities. EOs (volatile oils) are complex mixtures of odorous principles stored in special plant cells and glands in different parts of plants, which are obtained by living organisms and isolated by pressing and hydro or steam distillation in some plant families. The constituents of plant EOs fall mainly into two distinct chemical classes: terpenes and phenylpropanoids. Furthermore, terpene compounds can be divided into two main categories: (1) hydrocarbons, mainly the mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes; and (2) their oxygenated compounds, for instance, alcohols, oxides, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, acids, esters, and lactones. Several factors can influence the composition of EOs, including growth conditions, climate, altitude, soil type, agricultural methods and practices, developmental stage, plant part extracted, and harvesting time. The aim of this chapter is to investigate the chemical composition of various EO-bearing plants and the factors that are most influential in affecting the ratios of essential oil molecules made by the plant."
Chemistry of Isoprenoid Compounds,"Publisher Summary

This chapter discusses the chemistry of isoprenoid compounds. The chemical analysis of plant and animal material has shown the occurrence of a large number of compounds with a molecular structure, which can be constructed from isoprene or isopentane units. This structure appears in volatile oils of plants, the essential oils, valued since early history because they carried the Quinta essentia, the fragrance of the plants. The occurrence of this type of compound in oil of turpentine impressed upon them the name “terpenes.” Higher boiling fractions of the oils contained closely related compounds, which received the name of sesquiterpenes, because their formula contained 1.5 times as many carbon atoms as the monoterpenes. The variety in structure of the terpenoids is caused not only by the number of isopentane or isoprene units, but also by the way in which carbon atoms of the units are interlocked."
Chemotypes and terpene synthase genes in Thymus genus: State of the art,"Abstract

Aromatic plants belonging to the Lamiaceae have been used in folk medicine as well as flavouring herbs. This family includes numerous species which are rich in essential oils, that have been studied from both the volatiles point of view and using molecular tools. Thymus is one important genus from this family, comprising about 215 species, whose essential oils have been used by the pharmaceutical industry given their biological activities, namely antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. Essential oils are composed of a mixture of monoterpenes, among other constituents. Terpenoids show high structural variability and over 23.000 different metabolites are known. The occurrence of chemotypes in selected thymus species is listed and organized, and the concept of chemotype is addressed. A multiple approach, considering multivariate analysis of essential oil components and their metabolic relationship, is proposed for chemotype determination. Terpene synthase genes are described, with particular emphasis to the monoterpene synthases, its conserved motifs and features. The role of site directed mutagenesis and its contribution for understanding terpene synthases, revealing the role of some amino acids in the protein activity and final product synthesis is also explored. T. caespititius, a thyme species with carvacrol/thymol, a-terpineol chemotypes, among others, was chosen as an example to describe the state of the art on this topic. The high content of the phenolic monoterpenes makes this species interesting to explore as a source of compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Two ?-terpinene synthases were identified in this thyme species, revealing the existence of two isogenes, one isoform directed to the plastids and the other probably cytosolic, indicating the complexity of terpene synthesis. Functional analysis suggests the existence of additional levels of regulation that might involve direct temperature effect, regulating protein activity and thereby affecting the final product. This opens new layers of regulation that will undoubtedly bring complexity to essential oil composition on aromatic plants. In this review, data available both on essential oils characterization and on monoterpene synthase genes for Thymus species is summarized, stressing the importance of integrating molecular and biochemical data on chemotype determination."
Citrus CmTPS1 is associated with formation of sesquiterpene bicyclogermacrene,"Abstract

Citrus are rich in volatile terpenoids related to fruit flavor and defence response. Remarkable differences in Citrus volatiles provide us an ideal plant material to characterize novel genes associated with volatile formation. Bicyclogermacrene, a sesquiterpene, has high free radical scavenging activity and accumulates in finger citron (Citrus medica L. var. Sarcodactylis Hort) that belongs to wild species of Citrus family. In the present study, CmTPS1 comprised of 1668 base pairs was cloned, belonging to TPS-a subfamily. Transiently transform in tobacco leaf cells showed that CmTPS1 protein localized in the cytoplast. Enzyme activity assay showed that recombinant CmTPS1 catalyzed in vitro formation of bicyclogermacrene toward farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrates. Homologous transient over-expression in finger citron indicated that CmTPS1 also contributed to in vivo biosynthesis of bicyclogermacrene. Accumulated concentration of bicyclogermacrene positively correlated with CmTPS1 transcripts in developing fruit, flowers and leaves of finger citron. Melatonin treatment increased bicyclogermacrene contnent and CmTPS1 transcripts levels. Bicyclogermacrene was detected in finger citron fruit, but was under detected limits in mandarin, sweet orange and Citrus hybrids. Similar profile was observed for transcript levels of CmTPS1. These results indicated that CmTPS1 was associated with formation of sesquiterpene bicyclogermacrene in Citrus."
Cloning of hmg1 and hmg2 cDNAs encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and their expression and activity in relation to a-farnesene synthesis in apple,"Abstract

In plants, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) catalyses the synthesis of mevalonate from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. It has been reported to be the rate-limiting enzyme in sesquiterpene and triterpene biosynthesis and is encoded by a small gene family. The accumulation of a-farnesene in the skin tissue of apple fruit during storage appears to be predominantly through the classical mevalonate pathway and not through the novel glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate/pyruvate pathway independent of HMGR action. The content of a-farnesene in the skin tissue increased during the first 8 weeks of storage at 0 °C in air, and started declining after 12 weeks. In contrast, HMGR activity in the total membrane and soluble fractions, was the highest at the time of harvest, but decreased during the first 8 weeks in storage and remained stable thereafter. The potent ethylene action inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene inhibited a-farnesene evolution and HMGR activity by 97 and 30 %, respectively. As a first step in studying the molecular mechanism of apple HMGR regulation, we have isolated and cloned a full-length cDNA (hmg1) as well as a fragment (hmg2), using apple skin mRNA and RT-PCR in the presence of degenerate oligonucleotides designed against conserved regions of plant HMGR genes. Genomic Southern analysis using probes designed for the 3’-end of the two cDNA clones confirmed the presence of at least two HMGR genes in apple. The cDNA for hmg1 has an open reading frame of 1?767 nucleotides. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that the cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 589 residues with a relative molecular mass of 62.7 kDa. The hydropathy profile of the putative polypeptide indicated the presence of two highly hydrophobic domains near the amino terminus. Northern blot analysis confirmed that both hmg1 and hmg2 transcripts possessed a size of 2.4 kb. The two genes are differentially expressed during low temperature storage and in response to C2H4, with hmg1 being expressed constitutively and hmg2 being relatively more sensitive to developmental stimuli and ethylene."
Functional characterization and substrate promiscuity of sesquiterpene synthases from Tripterygium wilfordii,"Abstract

Acyclic terpenes, commonly found in plants, are of high physiological importance and commercial value, and their diversity was controlled by different terpene synthases. During the screen of sesquiterpene synthases from Tripterygium wilfordii, we observed that Ses-TwTPS1-1 and Ses-TwTPS2 promiscuously accepted GPP, FPP, and GGPP to produce corresponding terpene alcohols (linalool/nerolidol/geranyllinalool). The Ses-TwTPS1-2, Ses-TwTPS3, and Ses-TwTPS4 also showed unusual substrate promiscuity by catalyzing GGPP or GPP in addition to FPP as substrate. Furthermore, key residues for the generation of diterpene product, (E, E)-geranyllinalool, were screened depending on mutagenesis studies. The functional analysis of Ses-TwTPS1-1:V199I and Ses-TwTPS1-2:I199V showed that Val in 199 site assisted the produce of diterpene product geranyllinalool by enzyme mutation studies, which indicated that subtle differences away from the active site could alter the product outcome. Moreover, an engineered sesquiterpene high-yielding yeast that produced 162 mg/L nerolidol in shake flask conditions was constructed to quickly identify the function of sesquiterpene synthases in vivo and develop potential applications in microbial fermentation. Our functional characterization of acyclic sesquiterpene synthases will give some insights into the substrate promiscuity of diverse acyclic terpene synthases and provide key residues for expanding the product portfolio."
Functional characterization of four sesquiterpene synthases from Ricinus communis (Castor bean),"Abstract

Genome sequence analysis of Ricinus communis has indicated the presence of at least 22 putative terpene synthase (TPS) genes, 13 of which appear to encode sesquiterpene synthases (SeTPSs); however, no SeTPS genes have been isolated from this plant to date. cDNAs were recovered for six SeTPS candidates, and these were subjected to characterization in vivo and in vitro. The RcSeTPS candidates were expressed in either Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with engineered sesquiterpene biosynthetic pathways, but only two (RcSeTPS1 and RcSeTPS7) produced detectable levels of product. In order to check whether the engineered microbial hosts were adequately engineered for sesquiterpene production, a selection of SeTPS genes was chosen from other plant species and demonstrated consistently high sesquiterpene titers. Activity could be demonstrated in vitro for two of the RcSeTPS candidates (RcSeTPS5 and RcSeTPS10) that were not observed to be functional in our microbial hosts. RcSeTPS1 produced two products, (-)-a-copaene and (+)-d-cadinene, while RcSeTPS7 produced a single product, (E, E)-a-farnesene. Both RcSeTPS5 and RcSeTPS10 produced multiple sesquiterpenes."
Fungal metabolites as precursors to renewable transportation fuels,"Abstract

Fungi are known to produce hundreds of different polyketide, terpene, and terpenoid compounds and based on their chemical structures, 33 of these were selected for further assessment to identify compounds with potential for liquid transportation fuels. Eight of the 33 compounds were identified as having potential as gasoline blend components. Based on predicted boiling points and octane numbers, 2-ethyl-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, sabinene, isobutyric acid,1,8-cineole and linalool met the boiling point and octane number requirements used for the assessment, while 2-ethyl-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and isobutyric acid would require some upgrading. Limonene, isoamyl acetate, and 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-hexanone also have gasoline blend potential without upgrading. For diesel fuel, only 3,3,5-trimethyldecane met the boiling point, cetane number, and flashpoint requirements used for the assessment; however, with upgrading, 18 of the 33 compounds evaluated could potentially serve as blend components of diesel fuel. None of the 33 compounds without upgrading met the four ASTM D1655 specifications for Jet A and Jet A-1 fuel, but 3,3,5-trimethyldecane and limonene were very close. With chemical upgrading, 22 of the 33 compounds could have potential as jet fuel blend components. The monoterpene limonene and six sesquiterpenes were identified as fungal-derived compounds that with upgrading potentially could serve as components of high-energy jet, missile, or diesel fuels.

The increasing availability of fungal genomes and transcriptomes enables the identification of important metabolic pathways for hydrocarbon production. The number of fungal-based compounds having potential for use in hydrocarbon fuels and products is increasing as new compound and pathway discoveries are made and advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology enable the production of these compounds. Several challenges remain including increasing carbon flux toward hydrocarbon fuel precursors in primary metabolism, increasing the low titers of hydrocarbons produced, and establishing robust host strains. Also, more fuel property testing of fungal-derived compounds individually or in fuel blendstocks is needed to determine the true potential of these compounds in liquid transportation fuels."
GC-MS and 13C-NMR studies on the biosynthesis of terpenoid defensive secretions by the larvae of papilionid butterflies (Luehdorfia and Papilio),"Abstract

The biosynthetic pathway of some terpenic hydrocarbons present in the larval osmeterial secretions of Luehdorfia (homogeneous type) and Papilio (heterogeneous type) species was examined by in vivo experiments, using 13C-labelled acetic acid which was topically applied to the everted osmeteria. GC-MS investigation demonstrated that 13C was incorporated into mono- and/or sesquiterpene hydrocarbons with the enrichment factor of approx. 0.5% (L. puziloi), 1.0% (P. protenor) and 2.9% (P. helenus) by treatment with 1,2-13C-enriched acetic acid, thereby substantiating de novo biosynthesis of terpenes from acetate precursors by these larvae. The incorporation pattern of [2-13C]- or [1,2-13C]acetic acid into the carbon framework of ß-myrcene (L. puziloi) and (E)-ß-farnesene (P. helenus) as revealed by 13C-NMR spectroscopy definitely elucidated the biosyntheses of terpenic compounds in both species by the familiar terpenoid synthetic system with the isoprenoid skeletal units that is widely known in plants. Partial correction of previous assignment of 13C-NMR spectra of ß-myrcene and (E)-ß-farnesene is also made."
Genes and enzymes involved in bacterial isoprenoid biosynthesis,"Isoprenoids produced by bacteria are of particular interest as they encompass huge structural and functional diversity. A rapidly increasing number of bacterial derived isoprenoids have been reported in recent years, as many of the genes and biosynthetic gene clusters are responsible for their biosynthesis. Polyprenyl chains, synthesized by the condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate units, serve as the substrates for cyclases and subsequent tailoring enzymes. It is these enzymes, particularly the cyclases, which are responsible for the structural diversity of this chemical class. Recent studies have revealed novel insights into isoprenoid biosynthesis, and in several cases enzymatic mechanisms have been redefined."
"Genetic engineering of yeast, filamentous fungi and bacteria for terpene production and applications in food industry","Abstract

Terpenes are a major class of natural aromatic compounds in grapes and wines to offer the characteristic flavor and aroma, serving as important quality traits of wine products. Saccharomyces cerevisiae represents an excellent cell factory platform for large-scale bio-based terpene production. This review describes the biosynthetic pathways of terpenes in different organisms. The metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae for promoting terpene biosynthesis and the alternative microbial engineering platforms including filamentous fungi and Escherichia coli are also elaborated. Additionally, the potential applications of the terpene products from engineered microorganisms in food and beverage industries are also discussed. This review provides comprehensive information for an innovative supply way of terpene via microbial cell factory, which could facilitate the development and application of this technique at the industrial scale."
Genome Mining in Streptomyces clavuligerus: Expression and Biochemical Characterization of Two New Cryptic Sesquiterpene Synthases,"Summary

Two presumptive terpene synthases of unknown biochemical function encoded by the sscg_02150 and sscg_03688 genes of Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27074 were individually expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal-His6-tag proteins, using codon-optimized synthetic genes. Incubation of recombinant SSCG_02150 with farnesyl diphosphate (1, FPP) gave (-)-d-cadinene (2) while recombinant SSCG_03688 converted FPP to (+)-T-muurolol (3). Individual incubations of (-)-d-cadinene synthase with [1,1-2H2]FPP (1a), (1S)-[1-2H]-FPP (1b), and (1R)-[1-2H]-FPP (1c) and NMR analysis of the resulting samples of deuterated (-)-d-cadinene supported a cyclization mechanism involving the intermediacy of nerolidyl diphosphate (4) leading to a helminthogermacradienyl cation 5. Following a 1,3-hydride shift of the original H-1si of FPP, cyclization and deprotonation will give (-)-d-cadinene. Similar incubations with recombinant SSCG_03688 supported an analogous mechanism for the formation of (+)-T-muurolol (3), also involving a 1,3-hydride shift of the original H-1si of FPP."
Genome of Diaporthe sp. provides insights into the potential inter-phylum transfer of a fungal sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic pathway,"Abstract

Fungi have highly active secondary metabolic pathways which enable them to produce a wealth of sesquiterpenoids that are bioactive. One example is ?6-protoilludene, the precursor to the cytotoxic illudins, which are pharmaceutically relevant as anticancer therapeutics. To date, this valuable sesquiterpene has only been identified in members of the fungal division Basidiomycota. To explore the untapped potential of fungi belonging to the division Ascomycota in producing ?6-protoilludene, we isolated a fungal endophyte Diaporthe sp. BR109 and show that it produces a diversity of terpenoids including ?6-protoilludene. Using a genome sequencing and mining approach 17 putative novel sesquiterpene synthases were identified in Diaporthe sp. BR109. A phylogenetic approach was used to predict which gene encodes ?6-protoilludene synthase, which was then confirmed experimentally. These analyses reveal that the sesquiterpene synthase and its putative sesquiterpene scaffold modifying cytochrome P450(s) may have been acquired by inter-phylum horizontal gene transfer from Basidiomycota to Ascomycota. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that inter-phylum transfer of these minimal sequiterpenoid secondary metabolic pathways may have occurred in other fungi. This work provides insights into the evolution of fungal sesquiterpenoid secondary metabolic pathways in the production of pharmaceutically relevant bioactive natural products."
"Genome-wide identification, functional and evolutionary analysis of terpene synthases in pineapple","Abstract

Terpene synthases (TPSs) are vital for the biosynthesis of active terpenoids, which have important physiological, ecological and medicinal value. Although terpenoids have been reported in pineapple (Ananas comosus), genome-wide investigations of the TPS genes responsible for pineapple terpenoid synthesis are still lacking. By integrating pineapple genome and proteome data, twenty-one putative terpene synthase genes were found in pineapple and divided into five subfamilies. Tandem duplication is the cause of TPS gene family duplication. Furthermore, functional differentiation between each TPS subfamily may have occurred for several reasons. Sixty-two key amino acid sites were identified as being type-II functionally divergence between TPS-a and TPS-c subfamily. Finally, coevolution analysis indicated that multiple amino acid residues are involved in coevolutionary processes. In addition, the enzyme activity of two TPSs were tested. This genome-wide identification, functional and evolutionary analysis of pineapple TPS genes provide a new insight into understanding the roles of TPS family and lay the basis for further characterizing the function and evolution of TPS gene family."
"Guayule (Parthenium argentatum) resin: A review of chemistry, extraction techniques, and applications","Abstract

Guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) is a perennial shrub of the Asteraceae family native to the arid southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico that produces high-quality, hypoallergenic natural rubber. Guayule processing produces three output streams: high-molecular weight rubber as the primary product, a mixture of resin/low-molecular weight rubber, and a fine, dry woody bagasse. The goal of this review was to evaluate guayule resin as a source of natural resin and secondary metabolites in order to overcome obstacles to commercialization by maximizing the total economic value of extractable fractions, increasing the scale and robustness of extraction methods, while concurrently lowering the operational costs and environmental impacts of separations. Based on the literature and current market prices, the guayule resin applications with the highest economic potential are residential pesticides (with a specific price range of 1.1–6.8 USD/kg), paints and coatings (0.7–6.0 USD/kg), wood preservative coatings (0.8–6.0 USD/kg), amine-epoxy strippable coatings (0.8–2.5 USD/kg), and adhesives (0.125–1.60 USD/kg). The separation methods with the greatest potential for scale-up are pressurized solvent extractions, such as supercritical CO2 extraction, due to their reduced extraction times, energy requirements, and solvent consumption."
Harnessing yeast subcellular compartments for the production of plant terpenoids,"Abstract

The biologically and commercially important terpenoids are a large and diverse class of natural products that are targets of metabolic engineering. However, in the context of metabolic engineering, the otherwise well-documented spatial subcellular arrangement of metabolic enzyme complexes has been largely overlooked. To boost production of plant sesquiterpenes in yeast, we enhanced flux in the mevalonic acid pathway toward farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) accumulation, and evaluated the possibility of harnessing the mitochondria as an alternative to the cytosol for metabolic engineering. Overall, we achieved 8- and 20-fold improvement in the production of valencene and amorphadiene, respectively, in yeast co-engineered with a truncated and deregulated HMG1, mitochondrion-targeted heterologous FDP synthase and a mitochondrion-targeted sesquiterpene synthase, i.e. valencene or amorphadiene synthase. The prospect of harnessing different subcellular compartments opens new and intriguing possibilities for the metabolic engineering of pathways leading to valuable natural compounds."
"Herbivore-induced, indirect plant defences","Abstract

Indirect responses are defensive strategies by which plants attract natural enemies of their herbivores that act as plant defending agents. Such defences can be either constitutively expressed or induced by the combined action of mechanical damage and low- or high-molecular-weight elicitors from the attacking herbivore. Here, we focus on two induced indirect defences, namely the de novo production of volatiles and the secretion of extrafloral nectar, which both mediate interactions with organisms from higher trophic levels (i.e., parasitoids or carnivores). We give an overview on elicitors, early signals, and signal transduction resulting in a complex regulation of indirect defences and discuss effects of cross-talks between the signalling pathways (synergistic and antagonistic effects). In the light of recent findings, we review molecular and genetic aspects of the biosynthesis of herbivore-induced plant volatiles comprising terpenoids, aromatic compounds, and metabolites of fatty acids which act as infochemicals for animals and some of which even induce defence genes in neighbouring plants. Finally, ecological aspects of these two indirect defences such as their variability, specificity, evolution as well as their ecological relevance in nature are discussed."
Homologous and heterologous expression of grapevine E-(ß)-caryophyllene synthase (VvGwECar2),"Abstract

E-(ß)-caryophyllene is a sesquiterpene volatile emitted by plants and involved in many ecological interactions within and among trophic levels and it has a kairomonal activity for many insect species. In grapevine it is a key compound for host-plant recognition by the European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana, together with other two sesquiterpenes. In grapevine E-(ß)-caryophyllene synthase is coded by the VvGwECar2 gene, although complete characterization of the corresponding protein has not yet been achieved. Here we performed the characterization of the enzyme after heterologous expression in E. coli, which resulted to produce in vitro also minor amounts of the isomer a-humulene and of germacrene D. The pH optimum was estimated to be 7.8, and the Km and Kcat values for farnesyl pyrophosphate were 31.4 µM and 0.19 s-1 respectively. Then, we overexpressed the gene in the cytoplasm of two plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana and the native host Vitis vinifera. In Arabidopsis the enzyme changed the plant head space release, showing a higher selectivity for E-(ß)-caryophyllene, but also the production of thujopsene instead of germacrene D. Overall plants increased the E-(ß)-caryophyllene emission in the headspace collection by 8-fold compared to Col-0 control plants. In grapevine VvGwECar2 overexpression resulted in higher E-(ß)-caryophyllene emissions, although there was no clear correlation between gene activity and sesquiterpene quantity, suggesting a key role by the plant regulation machinery."
Horizontal pathosystem: resistance factors,"Publisher Summary

The nonspecific resistance factors in the horizontal pathosystem are divided into axeny and true resistance. Axeny is the resistance that occurs before a pathogen–plant cell contact, and true resistance is manifested after the pathogen contact with the cellular protoplast. The chapter explains how anatomical–morphological resistance factors are affected by plant habitus, downy leaves, structure and arrangement of stomata, and anatomic features of internal plant tissues. It also explains the regulation of ontogenesis and damage reparation in pathogens. Many plant parasites can penetrate into tissues only through wounds, and the rate of suberization of wound surfaces correlates with plant resistance. It also explains the nutrient value of infected organs and tissues. The chemical factors available to the plants for their own defense against diseases are diverse in chemical composition, conditions of production, and mechanisms of toxicity. This chapter discusses the chemical classification of phytoanticipins, which includes phenols, terpenoids, proteins, and amino acids. Plants possess not only chemically diverse defense compounds but also various strategies of their application. Protein inhibitors of viruses are a special group of vegetal antibiotic substances. The antiviral activity of a particular inhibitor is usually tested by mixing it with the viral suspension, the mix is used for inoculation of the leaves of a supersusceptible host plant, and then the number of infection spots that occurs is counted. Plant treatment with ribosome inhibitory proteins (RIPs) some time after the inoculation will not prevent development of the viral infection."
Isoprenoids: an evolutionary pool for photoprotection,"Plants have evolved several mechanisms for getting rid of excess energy in photosynthetic membranes, some of which involve isoprenoid compounds. In all photosynthetic organisms, the carotenoids ß-carotene and zeaxanthin, and tocopherols serve an important photoprotective role, either by dissipating excess excitation energy as heat or by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppressing lipid peroxidation. Isoprene and some monoterpenes, diterpenes and other carotenoids also occur in some plant lineages. Compelling evidence indicates that these non-ubiquitous isoprenoids might be particularly relevant in adapting plants to adverse climatic conditions by serving as additional and/or alternative protection mechanisms."
Light-driven chemical synthesis,"Depletion of the fossil fuel reserves of the Earth has prompted research into sources of renewable and sustainable energy, and feedstock for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries to support the transition towards a bio-based society. Photosynthesis efficiently captures solar energy, but its subsequent conversion into chemical energy in the form of biomass is limited to a final output in the 1–4% range. Re-routing of photosynthetic electron transport and reducing power directly into desired biosynthetic pathways offers a new avenue for sustainable production of high-value products."
Impact of elevated temperature and ozone on the emission of volatile organic compounds and gas exchange of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth),"Abstract

Plants emit a considerable proportion of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis back into the atmosphere as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Increasing evidence indicates that these compounds may have an important role in the adaptation of plants to changing climate, and that VOCs significantly influence atmospheric processes, such as formation of ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols. The effects of elevated temperature (ambient air temperature + 0.8–1 °C) and O3 (1.3–1.4× ambient O3), alone and in combination, on VOC emission, expression of genes related to VOC synthesis, and gas exchange were studied in four silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) clones grown in an open-air exposure field over two growing seasons. Photosynthesis and total emissions of mono-, homo- and sesquiterpenes and compounds other than terpenes [green leaf volatiles (GLVs) + methyl salicylate (MeSA)] were significantly increased and stomatal conductance decreased by temperature increase, while O3 reduced total emission of GLVs + MeSA and photosynthesis of birch. VOC emission rate corresponded with photosynthesis rate in the birch clones. Mono- and homoterpenes showed highest emission in August and GLVs + MeSA in July, whereas gas exchange decreased toward the end of the summer. In contrast to VOC emissions, transcription of genes encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) isomerase at the initial stages of terpene synthesis pathway was lower at elevated temperature and higher at elevated O3. In conclusion, rising temperature will substantially increase VOC emissions from silver birch, presumably independently from stomatal conductance and partially as a consequence of increased availability of substrates due to enhanced photosynthesis."
Impact of insect herbivory on plant stress volatile emissions from trees: A synthesis of quantitative measurements and recommendations for future research,"Abstract

Plants, and particularly trees, are the largest source of atmospheric volatile organic compounds globally. Insect herbivory alters plant volatile emission rates and the types of compounds that are emitted. These stress volatiles are a major contribution to total plant volatile emissions during active herbivore feeding, with important implications for atmospheric chemistry processes. However, emission models do not currently have a quantitative description of plant volatile emission rates during and after insect herbivore feeding. This review provides a brief background on plant volatile organic compounds, the urgency of including biotic stress emissions in models, and a summary of plant volatile emission models and steps they have taken to incorporate stress emissions into their framework. The review ends with a synthesis of volatile emissions from trees during insect herbivory. This synthesis highlights key gaps in studied systems and measurement approaches. We provide a summary of recommendations for future work to address these gaps, improve comparability between studies, and generate the data-sets we need to develop a descriptive model of these plant stress volatile emissions."
Improved conditions for production of recombinant plant sesquiterpene synthases in Escherichia coli,"Abstract

Amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS) from Artemisia annua and (+)-germacrene synthase (GDS) from Zingiber officinale were expressed in Escherichia coli under different conditions to optimize the yield of active soluble protein. The cDNAs of these enzymes were inserted into the pET28 vector (Novagen) and expressed in four different bacterial strains; BL21 (DE3), BL21 (DE3) Tuner™, BL21 (DE3) pLysS and BL21 (DE3) pLysS Tuner™ using different inducing agents (IPTG, The Inducer™). The effects of induction under osmotic stress in the presence of glycine betaine and sorbitol were investigated. Although background expression for ADS was reduced when using pLysS strains, no significant difference was noted for ADS activity in soluble whole cell lysates after induction with either IPTG or The Inducer™. For GDS, on the other hand, the change between BL21 (DE3) cells and BL21 (DE3) Tuner™, induced with IPTG, leads to a twofold increase in enzyme activity in the soluble fraction while a reduction in activity is observed when using the pLysS strains. The same doubling of activity is observed for GDS when the commonly used BL.21 (DE3) is induced with The Inducer™. Addition of 2.5 mM glycine betaine and 660 mM sorbitol to the bacterial growth media resulted in reduction of growth rate and biomass yield but under these conditions the best overall protein production, for both enzymes, was obtained. Compared to the standard conditions previously used in our laboratory the yield of soluble active protein was increased 7- and 2.5-fold for ADS and GDS, using BL21 (DE3) pLysS Tuner and BL21 (DE3), respectively."
In vitro culture of lavenders (Lavandula spp.) and the production of secondary metabolites,"Abstract

Lavenders (Lavandula spp., Lamiaceae) are aromatic ornamental plants that are used widely in the food, perfume and pharmaceutical industries. The large-scale production of lavenders requires efficient in vitro propagation techniques to avoid the overexploitation of natural populations and to allow the application of biotechnology-based approaches for plant improvement and the production of valuable secondary metabolites. In this review we discuss micropropagation methods that have been developed in several lavender species, mainly based on meristem proliferation and organogenesis. Specific requirements during stages of micropropagation (establishment, shoot multiplication, root induction and acclimatization) and requisites for plant regeneration trough organogenesis, as an important step for the implementation of plant improvement programs, were revised. We also discuss different methods for the in vitro production of valuable secondary metabolites, focusing on the prospects for highly scalable cultures to meet the market demand for lavender-derived products."
Increased sesqui- and triterpene production by co-expression of HMG-CoA reductase and biotin carboxyl carrier protein in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana),"Abstract

Terpenoids are the most diverse natural products with many industrial applications and are all synthesized from simple precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). In plants, IPP is synthesized by two distinct metabolic pathways – cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway for C15 sesquiterpene and C30 triterpene, and plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway for C10 monoterpene and C20 diterpene. A number of studies have altered the metabolic gene expressions in either the MVA or MEP pathway to increase terpene production; however, it remains unknown if the alteration of the acetyl-CoA pool in plastid fatty acid biosynthesis can influence terpenoid flux. Here, we focused on the fact that acetyl-CoA is the precursor for both fatty acid biosynthesis in plastid and terpene biosynthesis in cytosol, and the metabolic impact of increased plastidic acetyl-CoA level on the cytosolic terpene biosynthesis was investigated. In tobacco leaf infiltration studies, the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex (the enzyme supplying malonyl-CoA in plastid) was partially inhibited by overexpressing the inactive form of biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) by a negative dominant effect. Overexpression of BCCP showed 1.4–2.4-fold increase of sesquiterpenes in cytosol; however, surprisingly overexpression of BCCP linked to truncated HMG-CoA reductase (tHMGR) by a cleavable peptide 2A showed 20–40-fold increases of C15 sesquiterpenes (a-bisabolol, amorphadiene, and valerenadiene) and a 6-fold increase of C30 ß-amyrin. a-Bisabolol and ß-amyrin production reached 28.8?mg?g-1 and 9.8?mg?g-1 dry weight, respectively. Detailed analyses showed that a large increase in flux was achieved by the additive effect of BCCP- and tHMGR-overexpression, and an enhanced tHMGR activity by 2A peptide tag. Kinetic analyses showed that tHMGR-2A has a three-fold higher kcat value than tHMGR. The tHMGR-2A-BCCP1 co-expression strategy in this work provides a new insight into metabolic cross-talks and can be a generally applicable approach to over-produce sesqui- and tri-terpene in plants."
Influence of physiological and environmental factors on the diurnal variation in emissions of biogenic volatile compounds from Pinus tabuliformis,"Abstract

Biological volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) have a large influence on atmospheric environmental quality, climate change and the carbon cycle. This study assesses the composition and diurnal variation in emission rates of BVOCs from Pinus tabuliformis, using an enclosure technique. Environmental parameters (temperature and light intensity) and physiological parameters (net photosynthetic rate, Pn; stomatal conductance, gs; intercellular CO2 concentration, Ci; and transpiration rate, Tr) that may affect emission behavior were continuously monitored. The 10 most abundant compound groups emitted by P. tabuliformis were classified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The dominant monoterpenoid compounds emitted were a-pinene, ß-myrcene, a-farnesene and limonene. The diurnal emission rate of BVOCs changed with temperature and light intensity, with dynamic analysis of BVOCs emissions revealing that their emission rates were more affected by temperature than light. The variation in monoterpene emission rates was consistent with estimates of Pn, gs and Tr. Basal emission rates (at 30?°C,) of the main BVOCs ranged from 0.006 to 0.273?µg??-1/(hr g), while the basal ER standardization coefficients ranged from 0.049 to 0.144?°C-1. Overall, these results provide a detailed reference for the effective selection and configuration of tree species to effectively prevent and control atmospheric pollution."
Inhibitory effect of terpene nerolidol on the growth of Babesia parasites,"Abstract

Nerolidol is a sesquiterpene present in the essential oils of many plants, approved by the U.S. FDA as a food flavoring agent. Nerolidol interferes with the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in the apicoplast of P. falciparum. In the present study, the in vitro growth of four Babesia species was significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited in the presence of nerolidol (IC50s values = 21 ± 1, 29.6 ± 3, 26.9 ± 2, and 23.1 ± 1 µM for B. bovis, B. bigemina, B. ovata, and B. caballi, respectively). Parasites from treated cultures failed to grow in the subsequent viability test at a concentration of 50 µM. Nerolidol significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited the growth of B. microti at the dosage of 10 and 100 mg/kg BW, while the inhibition was low compared with the high doses used. Therefore, nerolidol could not be used as a chemotherapeutic drug for babesiosis."
Integrated metabolome and transcriptome analysis reveals candidate genes involved in metabolism of terpenoids and phthalides in celery seeds,"Abstract

Celery (Apium graveolens L.) seeds have a unique aroma and can be used in the pharmaceutical industry. Terpenoids are the main volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of celery seed essential oil, and phthalides are the source of its aroma. However, thus far, no studies have been conducted on the metabolism of terpenoids and phthalides in celery. In this study, 195 VOCs were detected in celery seeds by using headspace injection combined with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The content of 85 VOCs, including 20 terpenoids and 6 phthalides, was found to be significantly different during the five stages of celery seed development. Based on the pattern of changes in the concentrations of terpenoids and phthalides, an integrated transcriptome and metabolome analysis of three developmental celery seed stages was performed. The results showed that 11 differentially expressed structural genes involved in the metabolism of terpenoids have a positive correlation coefficient with 16 terpenoids, while 103 differentially expressed transcription factor genes are correlated with these 11 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among these differentially expressed transcription factor genes, two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes are similar with Arabidopsis thaliana bHLH gene (MYC2), which has already known to be involved in the regulation of terpenoid metabolism. The results of the integrated analysis also revealed that 88 differentially expressed transcription factor genes are related to 6 phthalides, and one myeloblastosis (MYB) gene is similar with petunia MYB gene (ODORANT1), which is involved in the regulation of the metabolism of volatile benzene compounds in petunia (Pharbitis nil) flowers. Therefore, this study has laid a foundation for further research related to the identification of key genes that regulate the metabolism of terpenoids and phthalides in celery. Moreover, these results can contribute significantly to the improvement in the quality of celery seed essential oil."
Medicago truncatula (E)-ß-ocimene synthase is induced by insect herbivory with corresponding increases in emission of volatile ocimene,"Abstract

Virtually all plants are able to recognize attack by herbivorous insects and release volatile organic compounds (VOC) in response. Terpenes are the most abundant and varied class of insect-induced VOC from plants. Four genes encoding putative terpene synthases (MtTps1, MtTps2, MtTps3 and MtTps4) were shown to accumulate in Medicago truncatula Gaertn. in response to Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) feeding and methyl jasmonate treatment in a previous study [S.K. Gomez, M.M. Cox, J.C. Bede, K.K. Inoue, H.T. Alborn, J.H. Tumlinson, K.L. Korth, Lepidopteran herbivory and oral factors induce transcripts encoding novel terpene synthases in Medicago truncatula, Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 58 (2005) 114–127.] The focus of the current study is the functional characterization of one (MtTps4) of these four genes. Using an M. truncatula cDNA clone, the insect-inducible putative terpene synthase was expressed in Escherichiacoli and shown to convert geranyl diphosphate (GPP) into the monoterpene (E)-ß-ocimene as the major product. The clone was therefore designated M. truncatula (E)-ß-ocimene synthase (MtEBOS). Transcripts encoding this enzyme accumulate in M. truncatula leaves in response to exogenous jasmonic acid treatments, lepidopteran herbivory, and lepidopteran oral secretions. Treatment with the ethylene precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) did not cause an increase in MtEBOS transcripts. The volatile (E)-ß-ocimene was released from leaves of both undamaged and insect-damaged plants, but at levels two-fold higher in insect-damaged M. truncatula. Although leaves have low constitutive levels of MtEBOS transcripts, RNA blot analysis indicates no constitutive expression in flowers, stems or roots. The strong insect-induced expression of this gene, and its correspondence with release of volatile ocimene, suggest that it plays an active role in indirect insect defenses in M. truncatula."
Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches driving isoprenoid production in Escherichia coli,"Abstract

Isoprenoids comprise the largest family of natural organic compounds with many useful applications in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and industrial fields. Rapid developments in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have facilitated the engineering of isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli to induce high levels of production of many different isoprenoids. In this review, the stem pathways for synthesizing isoprene units as well as the branch pathways deriving diverse isoprenoids from the isoprene units have been summarized. The review also highlights the metabolic engineering efforts made for the biosynthesis of hemiterpenoids, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, carotenoids, retinoids, and coenzyme Q10 in E. coli. Perspectives and future directions for the synthesis of novel isoprenoids, decoration of isoprenoids using cytochrome P450 enzymes, and secretion or storage of isoprenoids in E. coli have also been included."
Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for production of valerenadiene,"Abstract

Valeriana officinalis is a medicinal herb which produces a suite of compounds in its root tissue useful for treatment of anxiety and insomnia. The sesquiterpene components of the root extract, valerenic acid and valerena-1,10-diene, are thought to contribute to most of the observed anxiolytic of Valerian root preparations. However, valerenic acid and its biosynthetic intermediates are only produced in low quantities in the roots of V. officinalis. Thus, in this report, Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered to produce substantial quantities of valerena-1,10-diene in shake flask fermentations with decane overlay. Expression of the wildtype valerenadiene synthase gene (pZE-wvds) resulted in production of 12 µg/mL in LB cultures using endogenous FPP metabolism. Expression of a codon-optimized version of the valerenadiene synthase gene (pZE-cvds) resulted in 3-fold higher titers of valerenadiene (32 µg/mL). Co-expression of pZE-cvds with an engineered methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway improved valerenadiene titers 65-fold to 2.09 mg/L valerenadiene. Optimization of the fermentation medium to include glycerol supplementation enhanced yields by another 5.5-fold (11.0 mg/L valerenadiene). The highest production of valerenadiene resulted from engineering the codon-optimized valerenadiene synthase gene under strong Ptrc and PT7 promoters and via co-expression of an exogenous mevalonate (MVA) pathway. These efforts resulted in an E. coli production strain that produced 62.0 mg/L valerenadiene (19.4 mg/L/OD600 specific productivity). This E. coli production platform will serve as the foundation for the synthesis of novel valerenic acid analogues potentially useful for the treatment of anxiety disorders."
Metabolic engineering of microbial pathways for advanced biofuels production,"Production of biofuels from renewable resources such as cellulosic biomass provides a source of liquid transportation fuel to replace petroleum-based fuels. This endeavor requires the conversion of cellulosic biomass into simple sugars, and the conversion of simple sugars into biofuels. Recently, microorganisms have been engineered to convert simple sugars into several types of biofuels, such as alcohols, fatty acid alkyl esters, alkanes, and terpenes, with high titers and yields. Here, we review recently engineered biosynthetic pathways from the well-characterized microorganisms Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of several advanced biofuels."
Metabolic engineering of microorganisms for the synthesis of plant natural products,"Abstract

Of more than 200,000 plant natural products known to date, many demonstrate important pharmacological activities or are of biotechnological significance. However, isolation from natural sources is usually limited by low abundance and environmental, seasonal as well as regional variation, whereas total chemical synthesis is typically commercially unfeasible considering the complex structures of most plant natural products. With advances in DNA sequencing and recombinant DNA technology many of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for the production of these valuable compounds have been elucidated, offering the opportunity of a functional integration of biosynthetic pathways in suitable microorganisms. This approach offers promise to provide sufficient quantities of the desired plant natural products from inexpensive renewable resources. This review covers recent advancements in the metabolic engineering of microorganisms for the production of plant natural products such as isoprenoids, phenylpropanoids and alkaloids, and highlights general approaches and strategies to gain access to the rich biochemical diversity of plants by employing the biosynthetic power of microorganisms."
Metabolic engineering of natural products in plants; tools of the trade and challenges for the future,"Plant natural products play essential roles in plant survivability and many of them are used as nutrients, colorants, flavors, fragrances, and medicines. Genetic engineering of plants for natural products can help alleviate the demands for limited natural resources. Successes in enhancing production capacities have included manipulating blocks of genes coding for segments of pathways, over-expression of putative rate-limiting steps in pathways, expression of transcription factors regulating the entire metabolic pathways, and the construction of novel branch pathways capable of diverting carbon to the biosynthesis of unique metabolites in unexpected intracellular compartments. Further enhancements are likely if more efficient pathways can be constructed, providing for the efficient channeling of intermediates to final products, and if the means for sequestering natural products in planta can be accomplished."
Metabolic engineering of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for the photoproduction of the sesquiterpene valencene,"Abstract

Cyanobacteria are extremely adaptable, fast-growing, solar-powered cell factories that, like plants, are able to convert carbon dioxide into sugar and oxygen and thereby produce a large number of important compounds. Due to their unique phototrophy-associated physiological properties, i.e. naturally occurring isoprenoid metabolic pathway, they represent a highly promising platform for terpenoid biosynthesis. Here, we implemented a carefully devised engineering strategy to boost the biosynthesis of commercially attractive plant sequiterpenes, in particular valencene. Sesquiterpenes are a diverse group of bioactive metabolites, mainly produced in higher plants, but with often low concentrations and expensive downstream extraction. In this work we successfully demonstrate a multi-component engineering approach towards the photosynthetic production of valencene in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. First, we improved the flux towards valencene by markerless genomic deletions of shc and sqs. Secondly, we downregulated the formation of carotenoids, which are essential for viability of the cell, using CRISPRi on crtE. Finally, we intended to increase the spatial proximity of the two enzymes, ispA and CnVS, involved in valencene formation by creating an operon construct, as well as a fusion protein. Combining the most successful strategies resulted in a valencene production of 19 mg/g DCW in Synechocystis. In this work, we have devised a useful platform for future engineering steps."
Metabolic Engineering Strategies to Convert Carbohydrates to Aviation Range Hydrocarbons,"Abstract

Numerous hydrocarbon molecules with properties similar to aviation fuels can be found in nature, but are often only produced at low quantities in their native hosts. This chapter summarizes recent progress in the engineering of microbial cell factories for the production of the two major molecule classes: fatty acid-derived alkanes/alkanes and isoprenoids. It starts with a brief introduction to metabolic engineering. For each of the two molecule classes, it provides information on biosynthetic pathways as well as engineering strategies to enhance their formation in the microbial hosts. While most of these endeavours are still at the proof-of concept stage, the first commercial examples are beginning to emerge."
Metabolism of terpenes in the response of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) leaf tissues to UV-B radiation,"Abstract

This study investigated the terpene profiles as determined by GC–EIMS analysis of in vitro cultured plants of Vitis vinifera exposed to a “field-like” dose of UV-B (4.75 kJ m-2 d-1) administered at two different fluence rates (low, 16 h at 8.25 µW cm-2, and high 4 h at 33 µW cm-2). Low UV-B treatment increased levels of the membrane-related triterpenes sitosterol, stigmasterol and lupeol, more notable in young leaves, suggesting elicitation of a mechanism for grapevine acclimation. By contrast, accumulation of compounds with antioxidant properties, diterpenes a and ? tocopherol and phytol, the sesquiterpene E-nerolidol and the monoterpenes carene, a-pinene and terpinolene had maximum accumulation under high UV-B, which was accentuated in mature leaves. Also the levels of the sesquiterpenic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) increased under high UV-B, although 24 h post irradiation ABA concentrations decreased. Such increments of antioxidant terpenes along with ABA suggest elicitation of mechanism of defense. The adaptative responses induced by relatively low UV-B irradiations as suggested by synthesis of terpenes related with membrane stability correlated with augments in terpene synthase activity."
Metabolite and target transcript analyses during Crocus sativus stigma development,"Abstract

Saffron, the desiccated stigmas of Crocus sativus, is highly appreciated for its peculiar colour, flavour and aroma. Several studies have been conducted with the spice, but little is known about the evolution of volatile and non-volatile compounds generated during the development of the stigma. In this study, we have followed these compounds, with special attention to those of isoprenoid origin (carotenoids and monoterpenes), which are responsible for the organoleptic properties of saffron. The main compounds that accumulated throughout stigma development in C. sativus were crocetin, its glucoside derivatives and picrocrocin, all of which increased as stigmas reached a fully developed stage. The volatile composition of C. sativus stigmas changed notably as stigmas developed with each developmental stage being characterized by a different volatile combination. In red stigmas, ß-cyclocitral, the 7,8 cleavage product of ß-carotene, was highly produced, suggesting the implication of both ß-carotene and zeaxanthin in crocetin formation. As stigmas matured, hydroxy-ß-ionone and ß-ionone were produced while safranal, the most typical aroma compound of the processed spice, was only detected at low levels. However, a safranal-related compound 2,2,2-trimethyl-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione (4-oxoisophorone) increased rapidly at the anthesis stage and also in senescent stigmas. Monoterpenes were mainly emitted at the time of anthesis and the emission patterns followed the expression patterns of two putative terpene synthases CsTS1 and CsTS2. Fatty acid derivates, which predominated at the earlier developmental stages, were observed at low levels in later stages."
Microbial production of farnesol (FOH): Current states and beyond,"Abstract

Farnesol (FOH) recently has been paid close attention because of its intrinsic properties as a cosmetic, pharmaceutical and industrial material. However, extraction from natural sources and chemical synthesis often suffer from the low yield and purity. Metabolic engineering of microorganisms for FOH production is an alternative way to meet the ever-growing demands. Several efforts have been done to make it possible to produce FOH from microorganisms including S. cerevisiae and E. coli. With developments of systems biology and synthetic biology, an optimal industrial microorganism can be expected to produce FOH cost-effectively. This review aims to give an update on the various facets of FOH synthesis pathway including the features of involved genes and enzymes, and recent progresses on FOH production. Combining traditional metabolic engineering with these new fascinating molecular, systems biology and synthetic biology tools will provide a better understanding of FOH biosynthesis and a great potential of microbial production."
"Mild versus severe stress and BVOCs: thresholds, priming and consequences","Plant-generated volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) play key roles in large-scale atmospheric processes and serve the plants as important defense and signal molecules. The main emphasis in quantitative BVOC studies has been on constitutive emissions of isoprene and specific monoterpene species that are present in only certain emitting plant species. However, environmental and biotic stresses can induce emissions of an array of organic compounds in any plant species, whereas the magnitude of emissions induced by given stress depends on stress tolerance, timing, duration and severity (mild versus strong) of the stress. The main view put forward in this review is that quantitative understanding of stress effects is the key for constructing realistic models of both constitutive and induced BVOC emissions."
"Molecular cloning and characterization of (+)-epi-a-bisabolol synthase, catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of the natural sweetener, hernandulcin, in Lippia dulcis","Abstract

Hernandulcin, a C15 sesquiterpene ketone, is a natural sweetener isolated from the leaves of Lippia dulcis. It is a promising sugar substitute due to its safety and low caloric potential. However, the biosynthesis of hernandulcin in L. dulcis remains unknown. The first biochemical step of hernandulcin is the synthesis of (+)-epi-a-bisabolol from farnesyl diphosphate, which is presumed to be catalyzed by a unique sesquiterpene synthase in L. dulcis. In order to decipher hernandulcin biosynthesis, deep transcript sequencings (454 and Illumina) were performed, which facilitated the molecular cloning of five new sesquiterpene synthase cDNAs from L. dulcis. In vivo activity evaluation of these cDNAs in yeast identified them as the sesquiterpene synthases for a-copaene/d-cadinene, bicyclogermacrene, ß-caryophyllene, trans-a-bergamotene, and a-bisabolol. The engineered yeast could synthesize a significant amount (~0.3 mg per mL) of a-bisabolol in shake-flask cultivation. This efficient in vivo production was congruent with the competent kinetic properties of recombinant a-bisabolol synthase (Km 4.8 µM and kcat 0.04 s-1). Detailed chemical analyses of the biosynthesized a-bisabolol confirmed its configuration to be (+)-epi-a-bisabolol, the core skeleton of hernandulcin. These results demonstrated that enzymatic, stereoselective synthesis of (+)-epi-a-bisabolol can be achieved, promising the heterologous production of a natural sweetener, hernandulcin."
Molecular cloning and characterization of drimenol synthase from valerian plant (Valeriana officinalis),"Abstract

Drimenol, a sesquiterpene alcohol, and its derivatives display diverse bio-activities in nature. However, a drimenol synthase gene has yet to be identified. We identified a new sesquiterpene synthase cDNA (VoTPS3) in valerian plant (Valeriana officinalis). Purification and NMR analyses of the VoTPS3-produced terpene, and characterization of the VoTPS3 enzyme confirmed that VoTPS3 synthesizes (-)-drimenol. In feeding assays, possible reaction intermediates, farnesol and drimenyl diphosphate, could not be converted to drimenol, suggesting that the intermediate remains tightly bound to VoTPS3 during catalysis. A mechanistic consideration of (-)-drimenol synthesis suggests that drimenol synthase is likely to use a protonation-initiated cyclization, which is rare for sesquiterpene synthases. VoTPS3 can be used to produce (-)-drimenol, from which useful drimane-type terpenes can be synthesized."
"Molecular cloning, characterization and expression analysis of LoTPS2 and LoTPS4 involved in floral scent formation in oriental hybrid Lilium variety ‘Siberia’","Lilies are a commercially significant cut flower worldwide due not only to their elegant shape but also to their appealing scent. Among Lilium varieties, Lilium ‘Siberia’ is a cultivar that is prominent and highly favored by consumers due to its snowy white color and strong floral scent. Here, two terpene synthase genes (LoTPS2 and LoTPS4) that are responsible for floral scent production in Lilium ‘Siberia’ were cloned and functionally characterized. Recombinant LoTPS2 specifically catalyzed the formation of (E, E)-a-farnesene from FPP. Recombinant LoTPS4 is a multiproduct enzyme that produces D-limonene and ß-myrcene as major volatile compounds and ß-phellandrene, (+)-4-carene and 3-carene as minor products from GPP. Furthermore, LoTPS4 generates trans-a-bergamotene as a major product and di-epi-a-cedrene, a-cubebene and (E)-ß-farnesene as minor compounds from FPP. Subcellular localization analysis using GFP fusion constructs revealed that LoTPS2 was localized in the cytosol, whereas LoTPS4 was localized in plastids. Real-time PCR analysis showed that LoTPS2 was highly expressed in the petals and sepals of the flower, while LoTPS4 was highly expressed in the filament of the flower. Moreover, mechanical wounding of flowers revealed that LoTPS2 showed a strong response to wounding via a rapid increase in its mRNA transcript level. Our results will assist scientists in exploring the molecular mechanisms of terpene biosynthesis in this species and will provide new insight into the biotechnological modification of the floral bouquet in Lilium."
Review on plant terpenoid emissions worldwide and in China,"Abstract

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), particularly terpenoids, can significantly drive the formation of ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the atmosphere, as well as directly or indirectly affect global climate change. Understanding their emission mechanisms and the current progress in emission measurements and estimations are essential for the accurate determination of emission characteristics, as well as for evaluating their roles in atmospheric chemistry and climate change. This review summarizes the mechanisms of terpenoid synthesis and release, biotic and abiotic factors affecting their emissions, development of emission observation techniques, and emission estimations from hundreds of published papers. We provide a review of the main observations and estimations in China, which contributes a significant proportion to the total global BVOC emissions. The review suggests the need for further research on the comprehensive effects of environmental factors on terpenoid emissions, especially soil moisture and nitrogen content, which should be quantified in emission models to improve the accuracy of estimation. In China, it is necessary to conduct more accurate measurements for local plants in different regions using the dynamic enclosure technique to establish an accurate local emission rate database for dominant tree species. This will help improve the accuracy of both national and global emission inventories. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of terpenoid emissions as well as prospects for detailed research to accurately describe terpenoid emission characteristics worldwide and in China."
Rhizosphere associated bacteria trigger accumulation of terpenes in leaves of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Malbec that protect cells against reactive oxygen species,"Abstract

It has been proposed that plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) stimulate plant growth and development by inducing the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, like terpenes, which reduce stress incidence. Three bacteria previously isolated from grapevine roots and adjacent soil (Microbacterium imperiale Rz19M10, Kocuria erythromyxa Rt5M10 and Terribacillus saccharophilus Rt17M10) were tested as PGPR. After 30 days since root inoculation of in vitro grown Vitis vinifera cv. Malbec plants, the monoterpenes a-pinene, terpinolene and 4-carene, and the sesquiterpene nerolidol were detected only in bacterized-plant leaves. Also, the concentrations of the diterpenes a and ?-tocopherol, and the sterols sitosterol and lupeol were significantly enhanced compared to controls. The leaf extracts of bacterized plants showed photoprotective properties since they decreased the oxygen consumption (that is photo-oxidation) of the amino acid tryptophan in a sensitized solution, thus indicating an increment of the antioxidant capacity of the tissues. In addition, experiments with a-pinene and nerolidol standards showed the capability to intercept reactive oxygen species in the sensitized solution. Moreover, bacterized plants infected with the pathogen Botrytis cinerea showed a reduction in the lesion diameter compared with non-bacterized plants. The results suggest that M. imperiale, K. erythromyxa and mainly T. saccharophilus are able to induce a systemic response that trigger increases on monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, tocopherols and membrane sterols. These compounds enhance the antioxidant capacity in leaf tissues that may help grapevine to cope with stresses."
Ripening and Senescence,"Abstract

Fleshy fruit experiences profound physiological, biochemical, and structural modifications during ripening to facilitate seed dispersal and to become attractive and nutritious for human consumption. The metabolic networks regulating fruit ripening are very complex, and ethylene appears to be a key factor acting in concert with other environmental signals and endogenous factors. The classical distinction between climacteric and nonclimacteric ripening is now questionable, as different patterns of synthesis and sensitivity to ethylene may operate in the ripening of different fruits. In recent years, much progress has been done in the characterization of the main biochemical pathways implicated in the different ripening-associated processes and in the identification of key genes controlling these events. This chapter highlights current understanding and advances in the regulation of fruit ripening and key metabolic pathways associated with the different ripening-related processes, with emphasis on their impact on fruit quality."
RNA-seq based transcriptomic analysis of CPPU treated grape berries and emission of volatile compounds,"Abstract

Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is considered to be one of the most popular and widespread fruit crops in the world. Numerous value added products are prepared from grape fruit and investments are being made to establish new viticulture region (Hoff et al., 2017; Imran et al., 2017). CPPU [forchlorfenuron N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N-phenylurea] is a synthetic cytokine-like plant regulator which promotes grape berry set and development. The influence of CPPU [forchlorfenuron N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N-phenylurea] on berry development of ‘Shine Muscat’ (Vitis labruscana Bailey × V vinifera L.) grapes was evaluated under field conditions. A concentration response was observed over a range of 0, 5, and 10 mg L-1 CPPU that was applied to fruitlets (mean diameter 6 mm) at 2 weeks after full bloom. Gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC–MS) revealed that volatile compounds such as terpenoids and aromatics; especially linalool, geraniol and benzyl alcohols, were greatly reduced in CPPU-treated grapes. In contrast, aliphatics, such as hexanol, were increased in CPPU-treated berries. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were induced by CPPU, especially those related to volatile biosynthesis. A total of 494, 1237, and 1085 DEGs were detected in CPPU0-vs-CPPU5, CPPU0-vs-CPPU10, and CPPU5-vs-CPPU10 treatments, respectively. The results were compared against two databases (Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)) to annotate gene descriptions and assign a pathway to each gene. GO covers three domains: biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. Pathway enrichment annotation demonstrated that highly ranked genes were associated with the fatty acid degradation and biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid metabolism and biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction. Analysis with qRT-PCR of twelve selected transcripts validated the data obtained by RNA-seq. Additionally, we also found that genes such as CCDs (carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase), LOX (lipoxygenase), GGDP reductase (geranylgeranyl diphosphate reductase), PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) and some hormones related genes, were closely involved in the formation of volatiles compounds in CPPU treated berries. In summary, our results provide the first sequential transcriptomic atlas of CPPU treated grape berries which significantly increases our understanding of volatile metabolites and biosynthesis pathways in grape affected by CPPU."
Secondary Metabolism for Isoprenoid-based Biofuels,"Abstract

Historically, ethanol has served as an archetypal renewable biofuel. However, its suboptimal fuel properties such as low energy content and high water miscibility have provided a strong motivation to explore alternative biofuels with improved fuel properties and compatibility to the existing fuel infrastructure. Isoprenoids are considered one of the most promising advanced biofuel candidates due to their high energy content, hydrophobicity, and excellent cold weather properties. The biosynthetic pathways for isoprenoid production have been extensively studied and engineered for microbial production of flavors, fragrances, drugs, and more recently for the production of biofuels.

In this chapter, we will discuss naturally existing secondary metabolism pathways that synthesize isoprenoids. This work will focus on enzymes and their chemical reactions in particular. The mevalonate pathway and the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway are the two major metabolic pathways for isoprenoid biosynthesis, and they do not share any enzyme or pathway intermediate up to the production of isopentenyl diphosphate. In Sections 2.2 and 2.3, we will discuss the biochemistry and the engineering approaches of these two pathways. In Section 2.4, we will summarize the efforts to engineer the metabolic pathways for isoprenoid biosynthesis in microbial platforms for isoprenoid-based biofuels. The latest progress toward production of isoprenoid-based biofuels is reported, with highlights on engineering efforts to improve metabolic pathways, production hosts, and fermentation processes."
Sensitivity of Norway spruce physiology and terpenoid emission dynamics to elevated ozone and elevated temperature under open-field exposure,"Abstract

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from vegetation to the atmosphere contribute to global climate change, but climate change factors also affect VOC emission from vegetation. Soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings were exposed to elevated ozone (1.4 × ambient ozone concentration) and elevated temperature (ambient + 1.3 °C) alone and in combination as well as to ambient ozone and temperature treatments under open-field conditions. VOC emissions (mainly terpenoids), genes involved in early steps of plastidial monoterpene and isoprene synthesis, photosynthetic parameters and growth were measured. In July, when daytime elevated ozone concentrations had been over 40 ppb, ozone doubled the total terpenoid emissions by increasing the emissions of many monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Elevated temperature changed the terpenoid profile by increasing the emissions of oxygenated monoterpenes, but did not influence total emissions. Terpenoid emission profiles also differed between elevated ozone alone and elevated ozone in combination with elevated temperature. In August, when daytime elevated ozone concentrations had been ca. 30 ppb, significant treatment effects were not found. Ozone and temperature reduced the expression of DXS2B (1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase type II), and ozone that of DXR (1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase) in August. Elevated temperature reduced the stem diameter growth, net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, but elevated ozone did not have effects on these parameters. Results suggest that elevated temperature may not modify the ozone responses, or vice versa, in terms of gas exchange, growth or total terpenoid emission rates of young Norway spruces in a near-future climate. However, observed changes in terpenoid emission profiles may be important in the future climate, as reactivity in the troposphere differs between individual terpenoids."
"Sites of synthesis, biochemistry and functional role of plant volatiles","Abstract

All plants are able to emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the content and composition of these molecules show both genotypic variation and phenotypic plasticity. VOCs are involved in plant–plant interactions and for the attraction of pollinating and predatory insects. The biochemistry and molecular biology of plant VOCs is vast and complex, including several biochemical pathways and hundreds of genes. In this review the site of synthesis, the biosynthesis and the functional role of VOCs are discussed."
Strategies for transgenic manipulation of monoterpene biosynthesis in plants,"Abstract

Monoterpenes, the C10 isoprenoids, are a large family of natural products that are best known as constituents of the essential oils and defensive oleoresins of aromatic plants. In addition to ecological roles in pollinator attraction, allelopathy and plant defense, monoterpenes are used extensively in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. The importance of these plant products has prompted the definition of many monoterpene biosynthetic pathways, the cloning of the relevant genes and the development of genetic transformation techniques for agronomically significant monoterpene-producing plants. Metabolic engineering of monoterpene biosynthesis in the model plant peppermint has resulted in yield increase and compositional improvement of the essential oil, and also provided strategies for manipulating flavor and fragrance production, and plant defense."
Structural Analyses of Short-Chain Prenyltransferases Identify an Evolutionarily Conserved GFPPS Clade in Brassicaceae Plants,"Abstract

Terpenoids are the largest and most diverse class of plant-specialized metabolites, which function in diverse physiological processes during plant development. In the biosynthesis of plant terpenoids, short-chain prenyltransferases (SC-PTs), together with terpene synthases (TPSs), play critical roles in determining terpenoid diversity. SC-PTs biosynthesize prenyl pyrophosphates with different chain lengths, and these compounds are the direct precursors of terpenoids. Arabidopsis thaliana possesses a subgroup of SC-PTs whose functions are not clearly known. In this study, we focus on 10 geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase-like [GGPPSL] proteins, which are commonly thought to produce GGPP [C20]. We found that a subset of members of the Arabidopsis GGPPSL gene family have undergone neo-functionalization: GGPPSL6, 7, 9, and 10 mainly have geranylfarnesyl pyrophosphate synthase activity (C25; renamed AtGFPPS1, 2, 3, and 4), and GGPPSL8 produces even longer chain prenyl pyrophosphate (=C30; renamed polyprenyl pyrophosphate synthase 2, AtPPPS2). By solving the crystal structures of AtGFPPS2, AtPPPS2, and AtGGPPS11, we reveal the product chain-length determination mechanism of SC-PTs and interpret it as a “three floors” model. Using this model, we identified a novel GFPPS clade distributed in Brassicaceae plants and found that the GFPPS gene typically occurs in tandem with a gene encoding a TPS, forming a GFPPS–TPS gene cluster."
Structure and synthesis of polyisoprenoids used in N-glycosylation across the three domains of life,"Abstract

N-linked protein glycosylation was originally thought to be specific to eukaryotes, but evidence of this post-translational modification has now been discovered across all domains of life: Eucarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. In all cases, the glycans are first assembled in a step-wise manner on a polyisoprenoid carrier lipid. At some stage of lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthesis, the glycan is flipped across a membrane. Subsequently, the completed glycan is transferred to specific asparagine residues on the protein of interest. Interestingly, though the N-glycosylation pathway seems to be conserved, the biosynthetic pathways of the polyisoprenoid carriers, the specific structures of the carriers, and the glycan residues added to the carriers vary widely. In this review we will elucidate how organisms in each basic domain of life synthesize the polyisoprenoids that they utilize for N-linked glycosylation and briefly discuss the subsequent modifications of the lipid to generate a lipid-linked oligosaccharide."
Studies on the volatile compounds in flower extracts of Rosa odorata and R. chinensis,"Abstract

Roses are culturally and economically important ornamental plants in the perfume industry. Rosa odorata, the unique rose species in Yunnan region of China, with strong fragrance and abundant varieties, played a prominent role in the formation of modern roses' tea-scent. In the present study, three taxa of Rosa odorata and three taxa of R. chinensis germplasm resources were examined for their chemical profiles of volatile compounds of flower extracts at different flowering stages by sensory analysis and solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC–MS) analysis. A total of 103 volatile organic compounds (VOC) were detected, including 33 major compounds. The release of total VOC was in the following order: OG (R. odorata var. gigantea) > CSR (R. chinensis var. spontanea Red) > CSW (R. chinensis var. Spontanea White) > COB (R. chinensis 'Old Blush') > OE (R. odorata var. erubescens) > OO (R. odorata var. odorata). The production and release of floral VOC in double flowers were delayed by those in single flowers. Principal component analysis showed that some benzodiazepines and sesquiterpenoids were their characteristic substances, which could separate R. odorata and R. chinensis. R. odorata contained more volatile compounds originated from benzodiazepine metabolic pathway, such as 3,5-dimethoxytoluene and phenyl ethanol, which were not found in R. chinensis. In addition, the release of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene in R. chinensis was significantly higher than that in R. odorata. This study could provide a platform for floral gene mining and floral improvement breeding of ornamental plants to develop new raw materials for plant essential oils."
"Systemin and jasmonic acid regulate constitutive and herbivore-induced systemic volatile emissions in tomato, Solanum lycopersicum","Abstract

Transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants that overexpress the Prosystemin gene (35S::PS) and plants with a mutation in the JA biosynthetic pathway (def1) are known to exhibit a constitutive or reduced wound response, respectively. Here it is demonstrated that several independent 35S::PS lines emit high levels of specific volatiles in addition to increased accumulation of proteinase inhibitors (PIs). Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of systemically induced volatile compounds including green-leaf volatiles, terpenes, and shikimic acid-derivatives from 35S::PS and def1 plants in response to herbivore wounding and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) are described. Application of JA induced defense protein accumulation and volatile emissions in wild type plants, but did not further increase systemic volatile emissions from 35S::PS plants. Wounding by Manduca sexta larvae induced synthesis of defense proteins and emission of volatiles in wild type plants, but not in def1 plants. Application of jasmonic acid restored the local and systemic accumulation of defense proteins in def1, as well as enhanced herbivore-induced volatile emissions. These results provide strong support for the role of prosystemin- and JA-signaling in the regulation of volatile emissions in tomato plants."
Tailored carbon partitioning for phototrophic production of (E)-a-bisabolene from the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"Abstract

Photosynthetic microbial hosts such as cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae have recently emerged as alternative engineering platforms for the sustainable light-driven bio-production of terpenoids. Many desirable compounds with numerous applications can be produced in microorganisms by heterologous expression of terpene synthases. However, success of green microbial systems has been hampered by issues such as insufficient enzyme expression titers and low flux to desired terpenoid products from carbon fixed during photosynthesis. This work demonstrates how the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can be engineered to produce the sesquiterpene biodiesel precursor (E)-a-bisabolene. Through strategic genetic engineering, substantial enhancements of productivity were achieved by coordinated tuning of the isoprenoid metabolism, combining serial enzyme loading for terpene synthase overexpression and amiRNA-based repression of competing pathways. Up to 10.3 ± 0.7 mg bisabolene·g-1 cell dry weight could be produced in five days, which represents more than a 15-fold increase over single synthase expression strains. Investigation of strain performance in scale-up cultivations determined overall bisabolene productivity benefits from light:dark cycles. Mixotrophic cultivation can yield up to 11.0 ± 0.5 mg bisabolene per liter in seven days in these conditions, and phototrophic production of 3.9 ± 0.2 mg per liter was feasible. These achievements represent an important milestone in the engineering of C. reinhardtii towards the goal of designing sustainable, light-driven, green-cell algal bio-factories."
Terpene evolution during the development of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Shiraz grapes,"Abstract

The flavour of wine is derived, in part, from the flavour compounds present in the grape, which change as the grapes accumulate sugar and ripen. Grape berry terpene concentrations may vary at different stages of berry development. This study aimed to investigate terpene evolution in grape berries from four weeks post-flowering to maturity. Grape bunches were sampled at fortnightly intervals over two vintages (2012–13 and 2013–14). In total, five monoterpenoids, 24 sesquiterpenes, and four norisoprenoids were detected in grape samples. The highest concentrations of total monoterpenoids, total sesquiterpenes, and total norisoprenoids in grapes were all observed at pre-veraison. Terpenes derived from the same biosynthetic pathway had a similar production pattern during berry development. Terpenes in grapes at harvest might not necessarily be synthesised at post-veraison, since the compounds or their precursors may already exist in grapes at pre-veraison, with the veraison to harvest period functioning to convert these precursors into final products."
"Terpene synthases and the regulation, diversity and biological roles of terpene metabolism","Terpene synthases are the primary enzymes in the formation of low-molecular-weight terpene metabolites. Rapid progress in the biochemical and molecular analysis of terpene synthases has allowed significant investigations of their evolution, structural and mechanistic properties, and regulation. The organization of terpene synthases in large gene families, their characteristic ability to form multiple products, and their spatial and temporal regulation during development and in response to biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the time-variable formation of a diverse group of terpene metabolites. The structural diversity and complexity of terpenes generates an enormous potential for mediating plant–environment interactions. Engineering the activities of terpene synthases provides opportunities for detailed functional evaluations of terpene metabolites in planta."
Terpenes in Cannabis sativa – From plant genome to humans,"Abstract

Cannabis sativa (cannabis) produces a resin that is valued for its psychoactive and medicinal properties. Despite being the foundation of a multi-billion dollar global industry, scientific knowledge and research on cannabis is lagging behind compared to other high-value crops. This is largely due to legal restrictions that have prevented many researchers from studying cannabis, its products, and their effects in humans. Cannabis resin contains hundreds of different terpene and cannabinoid metabolites. Many of these metabolites have not been conclusively identified. Our understanding of the genomic and biosynthetic systems of these metabolites in cannabis, and the factors that affect their variability, is rudimentary. As a consequence, there is concern about lack of consistency with regard to the terpene and cannabinoid composition of different cannabis ‘strains’. Likewise, claims of some of the medicinal properties attributed to cannabis metabolites would benefit from thorough scientific validation."
Terpenoid biosynthesis in Dendrobium officinale: Identification of (E)-ß-caryophyllene synthase and the regulatory MYB genes,"Abstract

Dendrobium officinale Kimura et Migo is a well-known medicinal plant producing terpenoid alkaloids as the main medicinal constituents. D. officinale also produces many volatile terpenoids, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. However, little is known about the biosynthetic and regulatory mechanisms underlying terpenoid biosynthesis in this plant. This study first analyzed the terpenoid profiles of D. officinale PLBs treated with lovastatin (LOV) and fosmidomycin (FOS), two chemical inhibitors of terpenoid pathways, and produced corresponding transcriptomes. The volatile products of PLBs were mainly sesquiterpenes, and the contents of (E)-ß-caryophyllene and a-humulene were decreased by 42.05% and 27.27%, respectively, after LOV treatment. A candidate sesquiterpene synthase gene identified from the transcriptome and terpene metabolic profiling as (E)-ß-caryophyllene synthase (DoECS), localized in the cytoplasm. The emission of (E)-ß-caryophyllene decreased by 26.70% in DoECS RNA interference PLBs compared with the control group. Based on co-expression analysis, four MYB genes (DoMYB26, DoMYB29, DoMYB31 and DoMYB32) were involved in the transcriptional regulation of DoECS. Yeast one-hybrid assays and fluorometric GUS assay provided evidence that DoMYB26 and DoMYB31 positively regulated the expression of DoECS, while DoMYB29 negatively regulated the expression of DoECS. In summary, this study produced novel knowledge about the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids in D. officinale."
Terpenoids as Emerging Therapeutic Agents: Cellular Targets and Mechanisms of Action against Protozoan Parasites,"Abstract

Terpenoids are the largest and structurally most diverse group of secondary metabolites derived from natural sources. Empirical evidence from several bioassays points to the therapeutic potentials of terpenoids against protozoan parasitic diseases such as malaria, trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis. The versatility of the parent terpenoid backbones allows for structural diversity among the group, which in turn leads to multiple cellular targets and consequently varying mechanisms of antiparasitic action. Available data implicate disruption of parasite cell membrane architecture, interference with mitochondrial respiration, interaction with various crucial proteins of the parasites among other probable mechanisms. Identification of the specific cellular targets vis-á-vis the mechanisms of action of the different terpenoids will aid the design of novel and safer antiparasitic agent(s). This chapter therefore aims to discuss parasites-related cellular targets of terpenoids and their mode of antiparasitic activity. We hope that the chapter will be a valuable source of useful information in the exploration of the full potential of terpenoids as antiparasitic agents."
The biochemistry of homoterpenes – Common constituents of floral and herbivore-induced plant volatile bouquets,"Abstract

Volatile organic compounds emitted by plants mediate a variety of interactions between plants and other organisms. The irregular acyclic homoterpenes, 4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) and 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT), are among the most widespread volatiles produced by angiosperms with emissions from flowers and from vegetative tissues upon herbivore feeding. Special attention has been placed on the role of homoterpenes in attracting parasitoids and predators of herbivores and has sparked interest in engineering homoterpene formation to improve biological pest control. The biosynthesis of DMNT and TMTT proceeds in two enzymatic steps: the formation of the tertiary C15-, and C20-alcohols, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-geranyl linalool, respectively, catalyzed by terpene synthases, and the subsequent oxidative degradation of both alcohols by a single cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the herbivore-induced biosynthesis of TMTT is catalyzed by the concerted activities of the (E,E)-geranyllinalool synthase, AtGES, and CYP82G1, a P450 of the so far uncharacterized plant CYP82 family. TMTT formation is in part controlled at the level of AtGES expression. Co-expression of AtGES with CYP82G1 at wound sites allows for an efficient conversion of the alcohol intermediate. The identified homoterpene biosynthesis genes in Arabidopsis and related genes from other plant species provide tools to engineer homoterpene formation and to address questions of the regulation and specific activities of homoterpenes in plant–herbivore interactions."
The impact of cold stress on genes expression pattern of mono- and sesquiterpene biosynthesis and their contents in Ocimum basilicum L.,"Abstract

Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) contains valuable monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds used for medical purposes. Environmental stresses are suggested to change the essential oil composition in medicinal plants. In the current investigation, an experiment was arranged in greenhouse to study the effect of cold stress on genes expression patterns of linalool synthase (LIS), ß-myrcene synthase (MYS), ?-cadinene synthase (CDS), germacrene D synthase (GDS) and geraniol synthase (GES) which is involved in monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes biosynthesis in O. basilicum. The monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes composition and content were also investigated. Plants were exposed to temperatures 22 (control), 4 and 10?°C at 6 to 8 leaf stage for 12, 24 and 48?h. The genes expression levels were determined by real time PCR in plant leaves. Essential oil was extracted at flowering stage by distillation using Clevenger apparatus and its compounds were identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results revealed that the LIS expression increasingly occurred to 4.86 fold at 10?°C after 12?h while that of GES reached to 5.7 fold at 10?°C after 48?h. Temperature 4?°C for 12?h increased the expression levels of MYS and GDS genes to 41.5 and 14.2 fold, respectively, while the expression level of CDS increased to 25.5 fold at 4?°C for 48?h. Significant differences (P?=?0.01) were observed among treatments with respect to all compounds except a-pinene and camphene. The maximum proportion of geraniol and ?-cadinene were observed at 4?°C for 24?h, while the maximum proportion of germacrene D and a-bergamotene obtained at 10?°C for 12?h. The highest proportion of 1, 8-cineole was achieved at 4?°C for 48?h. Positive associations between germacrene D content and GDS expression (r?=?0.8, P?=?0.05) and ?-cadinene and CDS expression (r?=?0.78, P?=?0.05) proposed that the content of terpenoid compounds in basil can be enhanced through increasing the expression levels of genes involved in their biosynthesis."
The interactions of Trichoderma at multiple trophic levels: inter-kingdom communication,"Abstract

Trichoderma spp. are universal saprotrophic fungi in terrestrial ecosystems, and as rhizosphere inhabitants, they mediate interactions with other soil microorganisms, plants, and arthropods at multiple trophic levels. In the rhizosphere, Trichoderma can reduce the abundance of phytopathogenic microorganisms, which involves the action of potent inhibitory molecules, such as gliovirin and siderophores, whereas endophytic associations between Trichoderma and the seeds and roots of host plants can result in enhanced plant growth and crop productivity, as well as the alleviation of abiotic stress. Such beneficial effects are mediated via the activation of endogenous mechanisms controlled by phytohormones such as auxins and abscisic acid, as well as by alterations in host plant metabolism. During either root colonization or in the absence of physical contact, Trichoderma can trigger early defense responses mediated by Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species, and subsequently stimulate plant immunity by enhancing resistance mechanisms regulated by the phytohormones salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene. In addition, Trichoderma release volatile organic compounds and nitrogen or oxygen heterocyclic compounds that serve as signaling molecules, which have effects on plant growth, phytopathogen levels, herbivorous insects, and at the third trophic level, play roles in attracting the natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) of herbivores. In this paper, we review some of the most recent advances in our understanding of the environmental influences of Trichoderma spp., with particular emphasis on their multiple interactions at different trophic levels."
"The Isogene 1-Deoxy-D-Xylulose 5-Phosphate Synthase 2 Controls Isoprenoid Profiles, Precursor Pathway Allocation, and Density of Tomato Trichomes","ABSTRACT

Plant isoprenoids are formed from precursors synthesized by the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol or by the methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids. Although some exchange of precursors occurs, cytosolic sesquiterpenes are assumed to derive mainly from MVA, while plastidial monoterpenes are produced preferentially from MEP precursors. Additional complexity arises in the first step of the MEP pathway, which is typically catalyzed by two divergent 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase isoforms (DXS1, DXS2). In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the SlDXS1 gene is ubiquitously expressed with highest levels during fruit ripening, whereas SlDXS2 transcripts are abundant in only few tissues, including young leaves, petals, and isolated trichomes. Specific down-regulation of SlDXS2 expression was performed by RNA interference in transgenic plants to investigate feedback mechanisms. SlDXS2 down-regulation led to a decrease in the monoterpene ß-phellandrene and an increase in two sesquiterpenes in trichomes. Moreover, incorporation of MVA-derived precursors into residual monoterpenes and into sesquiterpenes was elevated as determined by comparison of 13C to 12C natural isotope ratios. A compensatory up-regulation of SlDXS1 was not observed. Down-regulated lines also exhibited increased trichome density and showed less damage by leaf-feeding Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars. The results reveal novel, non-redundant roles of DXS2 in modulating isoprenoid metabolism and a pronounced plasticity in isoprenoid precursor allocation."
The potential of the mevalonate pathway for enhanced isoprenoid production,"Abstract

The cytosol-localised mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway delivers the basic isoprene unit isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). In higher plants, this central metabolic intermediate is also synthesised by the plastid-localised methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Both MVA and MEP pathways conspire through exchange of intermediates and regulatory interactions. Products downstream of IPP such as phytosterols, carotenoids, vitamin E, artemisinin, tanshinone and paclitaxel demonstrate antioxidant, cholesterol-reducing, anti-ageing, anticancer, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. Other isoprenoid precursors including isoprene, isoprenol, geraniol, farnesene and farnesol are economically valuable. An update on the MVA pathway and its interaction with the MEP pathway is presented, including the improvement in the production of phytosterols and other isoprenoid derivatives. Such attempts are for instance based on the bioengineering of microbes such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as plants. The function of relevant genes in the MVA pathway that can be utilised in metabolic engineering is reviewed and future perspectives are presented."
The production of the sesquiterpene ß-caryophyllene in a transgenic strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis,"Abstract

The plant secondary metabolite, ß-caryophyllene, is a ubiquitous component of many plant resins that has traditionally been used in the cosmetics industry to provide a woody, spicy aroma to cosmetics and perfumes. Clinical studies have shown it to be potentially effective as an antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory agent. Additionally, there is significant interest in engineering phototrophic microorganisms with sesquiterpene synthase genes for the production of biofuels. Currently, the isolation of ß-caryophyllene relies on purification methods from oleoresins extracted from large amounts of plant material. An engineered cyanobacterium platform that produces ß-caryophyllene may provide a more sustainable and controllable means of production. To this end, the ß-caryophyllene synthase gene (QHS1) from Artemisia annua was stably inserted, via double homologous recombination, into the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. Gene insertion into Synechocystis was confirmed through PCR assays and sequencing reactions. Transcription and expression of QHS1 were confirmed using RT-PCR, and synthesis of ß-caryophyllene was confirmed in the transgenic strain using GC-FID and GC–MS analysis."
The rice (E)-ß-caryophyllene synthase (OsTPS3) accounts for the major inducible volatile sesquiterpenes,"Abstract

Terpenoids serve as both constitutive and inducible defense chemicals in many plant species, and volatile terpenes participate in plant a indirect defense by attracting natural enemies of the herbivores. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains about 50 genes encoding putative terpene synthases (TPSs). Here we report that two of the rice sesquiterpene synthase genes, OsTPS3 and OsTPS13, encode (E)-ß-caryophyllene synthase and (E,E)-farnesol synthase, respectively. In vitro, the recombinant protein of OsTPS3 catalyzed formation of (E)-ß-caryophyllene and several other sesquiterpenes, including ß-elemene and a-humulene, all being components of inducible volatiles of rice plants. The transcript levels of OsTPS3 exhibit a circadian rhythm of fluctuation, and its expression was also greatly induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). In addition, expression of OsTPS3 in transgenic plants of Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in emitting high quantities of OsTPS3 products. We also overexpressed OsTPS3 in rice plants which then produced more (E)-ß-caryophyllene after MeJA treatment. Finally, we found that the MeJA-treated transgenic rice plants attracted more parasitoid wasps of Anagrus nilaparvatae than the wild-type. These results demonstrate that OsTPS3, an enzyme catalyzing the formation of volatile sesquiterpenes, plays a role in indirect defense of rice plants."
The santalene synthase from Cinnamomum camphora: Reconstruction of a sesquiterpene synthase from a monoterpene synthase,"Abstract

Plant terpene synthases (TPSs) can mediate formation of a large variety of terpenes, and their diversification contributes to the specific chemical profiles of different plant species and chemotypes. Plant genomes often encode a number of related terpene synthases, which can produce very different terpenes. The relationship between TPS sequence and resulting terpene product is not completely understood. In this work we describe two TPSs from the Camphor tree Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl. One of these, CiCaMS, acts as a monoterpene synthase (monoTPS), and mediates the production of myrcene, while the other, CiCaSSy, acts as a sesquiterpene synthase (sesquiTPS), and catalyses the production of a-santalene, ß-santalene and trans-a-bergamotene. Interestingly, these enzymes share 97% DNA sequence identity and differ only in 22 amino acid residues out of 553. To understand which residues are essential for the catalysis of monoterpenes resp. sesquiterpenes, a number of hybrid synthases were prepared, and supplemented by a set of single-residue variants. These were tested for their ability to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes by in vivo production of sesquiterpenes in E. coli, and by in vitro enzyme assays. This analysis pinpointed three residues in the sequence which could mediate the change in product specificity from a monoterpene synthase to a sesquiterpene synthase. Another set of three residues defined the sesquiterpene product profile, including the ratios between sesquiterpene products."
The secondary metabolism of Arabidopsis thaliana: growing like a weed,"Despite its small stature, short life-cycle and highly reduced genome, Arabidopsis thaliana has a complement of secondary metabolites that is every bit as numerous and diverse as those of other plant taxa. The list of secondary metabolites isolated from this model species has expanded more than five-fold in the past ten years, and many more substances are likely to be added in the near future. Among the classes of compounds recently discovered are coumarins, benzenoids and terpenoids. Many A. thaliana secondary metabolites appear to have internal roles within the plant instead of (or in addition to) mediating ecological interactions."
The specificity of herbivore-induced plant volatiles in attracting herbivore enemies,"Plants respond to herbivore attack by emitting complex mixtures of volatile compounds that attract herbivore enemies, both predators and parasitoids. Here, we explore whether these mixtures provide significant value as information cues in herbivore enemy attraction. Our survey indicates that blends of volatiles released from damaged plants are frequently specific depending on the type of herbivore and its age, abundance and feeding guild. The sensory perception of plant volatiles by herbivore enemies is also specific, according to the latest evidence from studies of insect olfaction. Thus, enemies do exploit the detailed information provided by plant volatile mixtures in searching for their prey or hosts, but this varies with the diet breadth of the enemy."
Three-step pathway engineering results in more incidence rate and higher emission of nerolidol and improved attraction of Diadegma semiclausum,"Abstract

The concentration and ratio of terpenoids in the headspace volatile blend of plants have a fundamental role in the communication of plants and insects. The sesquiterpene (E)-nerolidol is one of the important volatiles with effect on beneficial carnivores for biologic pest management in the field. To optimize de novo biosynthesis and reliable and uniform emission of (E)-nerolidol, we engineered different steps of the (E)-nerolidol biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana.

Introduction of a mitochondrial nerolidol synthase gene mediates de novo emission of (E)-nerolidol and linalool. Co-expression of the mitochondrial FPS1 and cytosolic HMGR1 increased the number of emitting transgenic plants (incidence rate) and the emission rate of both volatiles. No association between the emission rate of transgenic volatiles and their growth inhibitory effect could be established. (E)-Nerolidol was to a large extent metabolized to non-volatile conjugates."
Tomato Fruits—A Platform for Metabolic Engineering of Terpenes,"Abstract

Terpenoids are a large and diverse class of plant metabolites including mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes. They have numerous functions in basic physiological processes as well as the interaction of plants with their biotic and abiotic environment. Due to the tight regulation of biosynthetic pathways and the resulting limited natural availability of terpenes, there is a strong interest in increasing their production in plants by metabolic engineering for agricultural, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications. The tomato fruit system was developed as a platform for metabolic engineering of terpenes to overcome detrimental effects on overall plant growth and photosynthesis traits, which are affected when terpenoid engineering is performed in vegetative tissues. Here we describe how the use of fruit-specific promoters for transgene expression can avoid these unwanted effects. In addition, targeting the expression of the introduced terpene biosynthetic gene to fruit tissue can take advantage of the large precursor pool provided by the methylerythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway, which is highly active during tomato fruit ripening to facilitate the accumulation of carotenoids. We also discuss how the production of high levels of target terpene compounds can be achieved in fruits by the expression of individual or a combination of (i) the MEP or mevalonic acid pathway enzymes, (ii) prenyltransferases, and/or (iii) terpene synthases. Finally, we provide a brief outline of how the emitted as well as internal pools of terpenes can be analyzed in transgenic tomato fruits."
Trace level determination of enantiomeric monoterpenes in terrestrial plant emission and in the atmosphere using a ß-cyclodextrin capillary column coupled with thermal desorption and mass spectrometry,"Abstract

For the first time, enrichment on solid sorbents followed by thermal desorption has been used for the determination of the enantiomeric signature of monoterpenes in the gaseous emission of terrestrial plants. A ß-cyclodextrin capillary column has been used for the separation of critical pairs. The temperature program and column loading were optimized for making the accurate quantification of individual enantiomers possible by mass spectrometry. The resolution achieved was sufficient for separating enantiomeric monoterpenes from other biogenic and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds present in air and vegetation emission samples. The method has been applied to the determination of the enantiomeric ratios of monoterpenes in the gaseous emissions of some evergreen plants and in the open atmosphere."
Transcriptome sequencing and functional characterization of new sesquiterpene synthases from Curcuma wenyujin,"Abstract

Tubers of Curcuma wenyujin are rich in essential oils, mainly various sesquiterpenes, showing antibacterial, anti-viral and anti-tumor effects. However, the molecular mechanism of C. wenyujin is deficient and related sesquiterpene synthases are still unclear. In this study, the transcriptome data of tubers and leaves from C. wenyujin were obtained and assembled into 78 092 unigenes. Of them, 244 unigenes were predicted to be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis while 131 unigenes were categorized as the “Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis” (TBB) term. Twenty-two unigenes possessed terpene synthase domain; five were predicted to be sesquiterpene synthases. Of the 208 unigenes annotated as cytochromes P450, 8 unigenes with full-length coding sequences were part of the CYP71 clade that primarily may perform hydroxylations of specialized metabolites. Furthermore, Ten DEGs related to the C5 precursor supply and sesquiterpene synthesis were validated by Real-time PCR; that showed a close correspondence with transcriptome sequence. A novel germacrene B synthase (CwGBS) and a-santalene synthase (CwSS) were identified in metabolically engineering E. coli. This study provided the first de novo transcriptome comparative analysis of leaf and tuber tissues from C. wenyujin, aiming to understand genetic mechanisms. Key genes involved in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpene will help for revealing the underlying mechanisms of C. wenyujin."
Transcriptome-guided identification and functional characterization of key terpene synthases involved in constitutive and methyl jasmonate-inducible volatile terpene formation in Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro) Hack,"Abstract

Centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides [Munro] Hack.) is a warm-season turfgrass, widely planted in residential lawns and recreational fields. Here, we uncovered three major terpenes released from the shoots of Eo: (E)-ß-ocimene (6%), a-muurolene (87.8%), and eremophilene (6.2%). Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment increased the emission of monoterpenes, including (E)- and (Z)-ß-ocimene, limonene, and myrcene, as well as sesquiterpene blends of (E)-caryophyllene, a-copaene, (+)-cyclosativene, and a-farnesene. RNA sequencing analysis predicted 14 putative Eo terpene synthase (EoTPS) genes, and two full-length EoTPS were successfully amplified: Eo7816 (1722 bp) and Eo6039 (1701 bp). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Eo7816 and Eo6039 belonged to the clades of TPS-b and TPS-a, respectively. The Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing Eo7816 exclusively released (E)-ß-ocimene (96%) with (Z)-ß-ocimene and myrcene. In contrast, Eo6039-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants emitted significant amounts of a-muurolene (69.4%) and eremophilene (21.8%). Together, we demonstrated that the two TPSs play roles in producing major volatile terpenes in Eo."
Utilisation of the MVA pathway to produce elevated levels of the sesquiterpene a-copaene in potato tubers,"Abstract

Potato flavour is a complex trait resulting from the presence of a combination of volatile and non-volatile compounds. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of specifically altering the volatile content of tubers and assess its impact on flavour. Tuber-specific over-expression of a potato a-copaene synthase gene resulted in enhanced levels (up to 15-fold higher than controls) of the sesquiterpene a-copaene. A positive correlation (R2 = 0.8) between transgene expression level and a-copaene abundance was observed. No significant changes in the levels of volatiles other than a-copaene were detected. Non-volatile flavour compounds (sugars, glycoalkaloids, major umami amino acids and 5'-ribonucleotides) were also determined. Relationships between flavour compounds and sensory evaluation data were investigated. Evaluators could not detect any aroma differences in the transgenic samples compared with controls and no significant differences in taste attributes were found. Thus although successful engineering of potato tubers to accumulate high levels of the flavour volatile a-copaene was achieved, sensory analysis suggests that a-copaene is not a major component of potato flavour."
Transcriptomic analysis of postharvest toon buds and key enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis during cold storage,"Abstract

Toon buds have been used in China as an important woody vegetable for its unique flavor. However, the changes of volatile terpenoids related to flavor and their biosynthesis in postharvest toon buds after cold storage remain largely unknown. Therefore, a transcriptomic database must be constructed to analyze the molecular mechanism of terpenoid biosynthesis in toon buds during cold storage. The chemical profiles of volatile terpenoids over postharvest storage periods were comparatively analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Results showed that the total content of volatile terpenoids and their oxidates, except for monoterpenes and a small portion of sesquiterpenes, increased significantly after cold storage. The transcriptome database derived from different cold storage times was established using BGIseq500 technology. Approximately 6.5?g of clean nucleotides were obtained and de novo assembled into 152 127 non-redundant unigenes, approximately 72.36% of which could be aligned to public databases. Many candidate genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis were identified. Furthermore, 29 513 unigenes were demonstrated to be differentially expressed under different cold storage times. These differentially expressed genes were functionally annotated by gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses. The expression of 20 putative unigenes involved in terpenoid pathways was confirmed by qRT-PCR, the results of which were consistent with the RNA-seq data. These genes with different expression patterns correlated well with the changes in the volatile terpenoids in the toon buds during low-temperature storage. In summary, our results showed that the high expression levels of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathways contributed to sesquiterpene biosynthesis after cold storage, which led to high sesquiterpene accumulation in toon buds during low-temperature storage."
Ultraviolet-B mediated biochemical and metabolic responses of a medicinal plant Adhatoda vasica Nees. at different growth stages,"Abstract

In the present study, the effects of elevated UV-B (eUVB; ambient ± 7.2 kJ m-2 day-1) were evaluated on the biochemical and metabolic profile of Adhatoda vasica Nees. (an indigenous medicinal plant) at different growth stages. The results showed reduction in superoxide radical production rate, whereas increase in the content of hydrogen peroxide which was also substantiated by the histochemical localization. Malondialdehyde content, which is a measure of oxidative stress, did not show significant changes at any of the growth stages however photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content showed reduction at all growth stages under eUV-B exposure. Increased activities of the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were noticed except ascorbic acid, which was reduced under eUV-B exposure. The metabolic profile of A. vasica revealed 43 major compounds (assigned under different classes) at different growth stages. Triterpenes, phytosterols, unsaturated fatty acids, diterpenes, tocopherols, and alkaloids showed increment, whereas reduction in saturated fatty acids and sesquiterpenes were observed under eUV-B treatment. Vasicinone and vasicoline, the two important alkaloids of A. vasica, showed significant induction under eUV-B exposure as compared to control. Treatment of eUV-B leads to the synthesis of some new compounds, such as oridonin oxide (diterpene) and a-Bisabolol oxide-B (sesquiterpene), which possess potent anti-inflammatory and anticancerous activities. The study displayed that differential crosstalk between antioxidants and secondary metabolites at different growth stages, were responsible for providing protection to A. vasica against eUV-B induced oxidative stress and enhancing its medicinal properties."
Understanding the consequence of environmental stress for accumulation of secondary metabolites in medicinal and aromatic plants,"Abstract

Abiotic stresses are the most critical hurdle for the growth and development of the plants. The abiotic stresses are salinity, heat, drought, flood, heavy metals and plant nutrients. Plants develop different tolerance mechanisms such as adjustment of membrane system, maintenance of cell wall architecture, production of secondary metabolites and antioxidants, phytohormones, and accumulation of osmolytes in response to abiotic stresses. The secondary metabolites, developed through various physiological and biochemical process, play vital role to cope up with different stresses. The presence of these compounds in the plant acts as an interface with its adverse environment. Primary metabolites are the precursors for the secondary metabolites production in plants, but its concentration and transport are influenced with the changes in climatic conditions. Stress conditions also enhance the expression level of corresponding genes involved in the natural product biosynthesis. The secondary metabolites produced as a result of abiotic stresses are involved in plant defence system for survival. Secondary metabolites never participate in building block processes rather they function to deal with many external agents. They also protect plant from various biotic stresses and facilitate in pollination and fruit dispersal mechanism by attracting the pollinating and dispersing agent through their beautiful colour and fragrance. In this review, we tried to figure out how abiotic stresses affect the production of secondary metabolites in medicinal and aromatic plants."
Use of Essential Oils and Their Components against Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria,"Abstract

Aromatic and medicinal plants, through their secondary metabolism, provide a complex mixture of volatile molecules known as essential oils. These volatile molecules exert antibacterial activity that has been used in folk medicine for centuries. During the last few decades, the emergence of antibacterial resistance has forced us to search for new and efficient antimicrobial agents. The significant number of studies on the use of essential oils and their components against multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa show the exceptional potential of these natural products to curb the development of antibacterial resistance. Moreover, the use of essential oils and their components in combination with antibiotics may increase bacterial susceptibility, thus limiting resistance."
Current Insights on the Role of Terpenoids as Anticancer Agents: A Perspective on Cancer Prevention and Treatment,"Terpenoids are known to be a large family of secondary metabolites found ubiquitously in the plant kingdom and structurally composed of isoprenoid units. The diverse array of terpenoids has increased the interest in their commercial and pharmaceutical uses due to their antioxidative, anti-inflammation, and anticancer properties. Based on the structure, terpenoids are divided into six classes, namely monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, tetraterpenes, and polyterpenes. Several terpenoids have been found to exhibit anticancer property via acting on different stages of tumor development, such as inhibition of the early initiation and progression of tumorigenesis by inducing cell cycle arrest, tumor cell differentiation, and apoptosis, and in the late stages, suppression of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis through the regulation of various intracellular signaling pathways. A relevant progress in the delineation of the detailed mechanism of their anticancer action has made these compounds as a promising therapeutic agents. Thus, the aim of this chapter is to present an updated overview of the current progress in the anticancer properties of terpenoids."
Cytochrome P450-enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of mono- and sesquiterpenes,"Terpenoids form the largest group of plant specialized metabolites and exhibit essential functions in plant metabolism, propagation and defence. Since several mono- and sesquiterpenoids, like artemisinin, menthol and nootkatone, have proven beneficial for mankind, they also possess high socio-economic value. The general mechanisms of terpene biosynthesis are understood and enzymes catalysing the formation of the isoprenoid basic carbon skeletons have been described frequently. In the subsequent pathway steps, it is mainly cytochromes P450 that catalyse the decoration of these basic skeletons and thereby contribute significantly to the structural diversity observed. Structure–function relationship, even though discussed intensively, is poorly understood for this enzyme family; even with the phylogenic relationship well established identification of the functionality of the single enzymes is challenging, and, so far, only a few have been characterized. This review provides an overview over cytochromes P450 participating in the biosynthesis of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Only enzymes that have been described thoroughly after purification and heterologous expression are included in this review and their characteristic features are discussed."
De novo assembly and comparative transcriptome analysis: novel insights into terpenoid biosynthesis in Chamaemelum nobile L.,"Analysis of terpenoids content, transcriptome from Chamaemelum nobile showed that the content of the terpenoids in the roots was the highest and key genes involved in the terpenoids synthesis pathway were identified."
De novo transcriptome sequencing in Ficus hirta Vahl. (Moraceae) to investigate gene regulation involved in the biosynthesis of pollinator attracting volatiles,"Flower volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the receptive figs of Ficus (Moraceae) play important roles in maintaining the specificity of pollinator attraction and reproductive isolation between host species. The dominant components of VOCs are terpenoids, and while the genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis are known, we know very little about the regulation of these genes and its relationship to pollinator attraction in Ficus. Thus, we selected pre-receptive (pre-VOC attractant-emitting) and receptive (VOC attractant-emitting) phase female flowers of a dioecious fig for transcriptome sequencing to investigate the differential activity of genes, including those related to terpenoid biosynthesis. We annoted 53,445 unigenes, of which 608 were found to be differently expressed in the two stages, with 242 unigenes upregulated and 366 unigenes downregulated in pre-receptive relative to receptive phase flowers. With respect to the production of VOCs, 80 unigenes encoded 34 enzyme-coding genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, including nearly all key enzymes of the MVA and MEP pathways forming the backbone of terpenoid biosynthesis. We designed pair primers for 16 of these 34 enzyme genes and validated 5 of them in 30 Ficus species representing 6 subgenera. In addition to the transcript sequences, we identified 35,558 putative microsatellite loci and designed primers for 11,468 of them. Our data and results will contribute to genetic research on terpene biosynthesis in figs and will aid in the understanding of the morphological and chemical changes that occur as the female flowers develop and produce pollinator-specific VOCs."
Developmental variations in sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis in East Indian sandalwood tree (Santalum album L.),"The East Indian sandalwood tree, Santalum album L. is known for its fragrant heartwood and essential oil. The major bioactive principles of sandalwood oil, i.e., sesquiterpenoids (C15 isoprenoids), are known as ‘santalols’ and are globally used in medicinal, cosmetic, dietary, and aromatherapeutic applications. However, there are no available reports on the biosynthesis and metabolism of isoprenoids in this forest tree. Hence, we provide detailed insights into sesquiterpenoid metabolism across several in vitro and in vivo developmental stages. Since no molecular information was available, several genes encoding enzymes participating in early and critical steps of isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways were isolated using degenerate primers, and their expression patterns across the developmental stages were studied by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results indicate that the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is differentially regulated with development and in tissue-specific manner. Accumulation of plastidial isoprenoid pigments increased with development, while the amounts of farnesylated intermediates decreased with maturation, thereby possibly indicating conversion into sesquiterpenoids. A differential expression pattern was observed for hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and 1-deoxyxyulose-5-phosphate synthase at the levels of transcripts and proteins, indicating post-transcriptional regulation. Transcript levels of farnesyl pyrophsophate, sesquiterpene and monoterpene synthases were quantitatively higher in callus, and lower in matured tree leaves. Sesquiterpene synthase activity across different developmental stages indicated a tissue-specific conversion and accumulation. Henceforth, the results would facilitate characterization of routes of sandalwood oil biosynthesis and for future improvement of sesquiterpenoid content in this tree."
"Diffuse Water Pollution by Anthraquinone and Azo Dyes in Environment Importantly Alters Foliage Volatiles, Carotenoids and Physiology in Wheat (Triticum aestivum)","To gain insight into the effects of aqueous solutions of different dyes on plant performance and identify the most promising traits for fast assessment of toxicity, we studied the influences of two anthraquinone dyes (Optilan Blue and Lanasyn Blue) and four azo dyes (Lanasyn Red, Nylosan Red, Nylosan Dark Brown and Lanasyn Dark Brown) at two different concentrations (0.5 and 1.5 mg?l-1) on foliage photosynthesis, photosynthetic pigments and emissions of lipoxygenase pathway products (LOX; green leaf volatiles) and monoterpenes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. “Lovrin”). Net assimilation rate was only inhibited by the highest concentration of Nylosan Red, while stomatal conductance to water vapor was strongly influenced by all azo dyes. Concentrations of photosynthetic pigments, chlorophylls and carotenoids, were most strongly reduced in treatments with azo dyes especially with those which contained chromium in their molecular structure. These data collectively indicate important reduction of foliage physiological activity by textile dyes and indicate that emissions of leaf volatiles can provide a promising tool to assess the toxicity of different dyes."
Direct suppression of a rice bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) by monoterpene (S)-limonene,"Rice bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is a severe disease of rice plants. Upon pathogen infection, rice biosynthesizes phytoalexins, including diterpenoids such as momilactones, phytocassanes, and oryzalexins. However, information on headspace volatiles in response to Xoo infection is limited. We have examined headspace volatile terpenes, induced by the infection of Xoo, and investigated their biological roles in the rice plant. Monoterpenes a-thujene, a-pinene, sabinene, myrcene, a-terpene, and (S)-limonene and sesquiterpenes cyclosativene, a-copaene, and ß-elemene were detected from 1-week-old Xoo-infected rice seedlings, by solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. All monoterpenes were constitutively released from rice seedlings before Xoo infection. However, (S)-limonene emission was further elicited after exposure of the seedlings to Xoo in coincidence with upregulation of limonene synthase gene (OsTPS20) transcripts. Only the stereospecific (S)-limonene [and not (R)-limonene or other monoterpenes] severely inhibited Xoo growth, as confirmed by disc diffusion and liquid culture assays. Rice seedlings showed suppressed pathogenic symptoms suggestive of resistance to Xoo infection after foliar treatment with (S)-limonene. Collectively, our findings suggest that (S)-limonene is a volatile phytoanticipin, which plays a significant role in suppressing Xoo growth in rice seedlings."
"Diversity, regulation, and genetic manipulation of plant mono- and sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis","Among plant secondary metabolites, terpenoids are the most abundant and structurally diverse group. In addition to their important roles in pollinator attraction and direct and indirect plant defense, terpenoids are also commercially valuable due to their broad applications in the cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Because of their functional versatility and wide distribution, great efforts have been made to decipher terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, to investigate the molecular mechanism determining their structural diversity, and to understand their biosynthetic regulation. Recent progress on the manipulation of terpenoid production in transgenic plants not only holds considerable promise for improving various plant traits and crop protection but also increases our understanding of the significance of terpenoid metabolites in mediating plant-environment interactions."
Ectomycorrhiza and Secondary Metabolites,"Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis leads to the diversification of both the mycobiont and their host. Differences in organogenetic programs are reflected in ectomycorrhizal root morphology, but key developmental programs are triggered in the physiological processes in both symbiosis partners and are dependent on hormones and secondary signals. Identifying the processes that regulate the signals flow between mycorrhizal fungi and host roots is of a great significance."
Efficient functional analysis system for cyanobacterial or plant cytochromes P450 involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis,"Tractable plasmids (pAC-Mv-based plasmids) for Escherichia coli were constructed, which carried a mevalonate-utilizing gene cluster, towards an efficient functional analysis of cytochromes P450 involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. They included genes coding for a series of redox partners that transfer the electrons from NAD(P)H to a P450 protein. The redox partners used were ferredoxin reductases (CamA and NsRED) and ferredoxins (CamB and NsFER), which are derived from Pseudomonas putida and cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7120, respectively, as well as three higher-plant NADPH-P450 reductases, the Arabidopsis thaliana ATR2 and two corresponding enzymes derived from ginger (Zingiber officinale), named ZoRED1 and ZoRED2. We also constructed plasmids for functional analysis of two P450s, a-humulene-8-hydroxylase (CYP71BA1) from shampoo ginger (Zingiber zerumbet) and germacrene A hydroxylase (P450NS; CYP110C1) from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, and co-transformed E. coli with each of the pAC-Mv-based plasmids. Production levels of 8-hydroxy-a-humulene with recombinant E. coli cells (for CYP71BA1) were 1.5- to 2.3-fold higher than that of a control strain without the mevalonate-pathway genes. Level of the P450NS product with the combination of NsRED and NsFER was 2.9-fold higher than that of the CamA and CamB. The predominant product of P450NS was identified as 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-6-isopropenyl-4,8a-dimethylnaphth-1-ol with NMR analyses."
Efficient synthesis of functional isoprenoids from acetoacetate through metabolic pathway-engineered Escherichia coli,"We show here an efficient synthesis system of isoprenoids from acetoacetate as the main substrate. We expressed in Escherichia coli a Streptomyces mevalonate pathway gene cluster starting from HMG-CoA synthase and including isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (idi) type 2 gene and the yeast idi type 1 and rat acetoacetate-CoA ligase (Aacl) genes. When the a-humulene synthase (ZSS1) gene of shampoo ginger was expressed in this transformant, the resultant E. coli produced 958 µg/mL culture of a-humulene with a lithium acetoacetate (LAA) supplement, which was a 13.6-fold increase compared with a control E. coli strain expressing only ZSS1. Next, we investigated if this E. coli strain engineered to utilize acetoacetate can synthesize carotenoids effectively. When the crtE, crtB, and crtI genes required for lycopene synthesis were expressed in the transformant, lycopene amounts reached 12.5 mg/g dry cell weight with addition of LAA, an 11.8-fold increase compared with a control expressing only the three crt genes. As for astaxanthin production with the E. coli transformant, in which the crtE, crtB, crtI, crtY, crtZ, and crtW genes were expressed, the total amount of carotenoids produced (astaxanthin, lycopene, and phytoene) was significantly increased to 7.5 times that of a control expressing only the six crt genes."
"Elucidating the Formation of Geranyllinalool, the Precursor of the Volatile C16-Homoterpene TMTT Involved in Indirect Plant Defense","Plants produce volatile compounds as communication signals for the interaction with other organisms. The volatile C16-homoterpene TMTT (4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene) is released from the foliage of many plants including Arabidopsis thaliana upon herbivore attack and is assumed to play a role in attracting parasitoids or predators of herbivores. Despite the widespread occurrence of TMTT, its biosynthesis is not well understood. We have identified Arabidopsis TPS04 (At1g61120) as the terpene synthase catalyzing the first dedicated step in TMTT formation. TPS04 functions as a geranyllinalool synthase (GES) by converting the C20 diterpene precursor all-trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into the C20 tertiary alcohol (E,E)-geranyllinalool (GL). GL is further converted into TMTT by enzymatic oxidative degradation. Arabidopsis TPS04 gene knockout lines are deficient in the formation of GL and TMTT. This phenotype is complemented by expression of GES under control of an alcohol-inducible or constitutive promoter. Constitutive formation of GL and TMTT causes the appearance of lesions on cotyledons and leads to reduced growth. Transcription of GES and the synthesis of GL and TMTT are induced by feeding of the crucifer-specialist Plutella xylostella and by treatment with the fungal elicitor alamethicin or the jasmonate mimic coronalon. Regulation of GES transcription is dependent on the octadecanoid-dependent signaling pathway and is not modified by salicylic acid or ethylene. In contrast to other diterpene synthases, GES is not located in plastids but resides instead in the cytosol or the endoplasmic reticulum. The identification of GES provides a useful tool to further investigate the specific role of TMTT in plant–organism interactions and to elucidate the TMTT biosynthetic pathway and its regulation."
Elucidating the Metabolism of Plant Terpene Volatiles: Alternative Tools for Engineering Plant Defenses?,"Plants produce a diversity of volatile organic compounds that have important ecological functions. When emitted from plants upon herbivore damage, volatiles serve as direct defense compounds or attract natural enemies of herbivores, a response known as “indirect defense.” Terpene metabolites constitute a predominant group of plant volatiles with recognized function in plant defense. The possibility of developing alternative pest control strategies based on these natural defenses has fueled novel attempts to metabolically engineer volatile emissions and enhance their effectiveness in plant defense. We address recent advances in this area with an emphasis on homoterpene volatiles. We show that the Arabidopsis model serves as an important resource, which provides molecular and genetic tools to investigate and manipulate the biosynthesis of volatile terpenes, especially homoterpenes, and to decipher their roles in plant defense responses."
Endogenous plant metabolites against insects,"Herbivorous insects are responsible for large losses to agriculture through feeding damage itself but also by vectoring pathogens such as viruses. Plants have evolved various mechanisms to defend themselves against insects, including the production of specialised metabolites that act as natural insecticides. Throughout history, plants and plant extracts harbouring specialised metabolites have been exploited by man for their anti-insect properties. Also, commercial insecticides are often based on plant-specialised metabolites and adapted further e.g. to give them the physicochemical properties that render them systemic. The development and application of these synthetic pesticides has made it possible to scale up the production and to increase the yield of food crops worldwide. However, their adversary effects on the environment and on non-target organisms, first discussed in Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, continue to cause debate and recently resulted in a ban on the use of certain pesticides in the European Union. The trait of insect defence has been largely overlooked during crop domestication and resulted in basically unarmed crop plants. Endogenous production of specialised metabolites could be re-introduced in modern crop varieties to retrieve self-defences. However, despite the fact that a plethora of specialised metabolites from plants has been described, studies that validate their deterrent or insecticidal effect in planta (crop), let alone in field situations, are sparse. To answer the question whether it is feasible to re-introduce endogenous insecticides to bring about insect resistance, the defence metabolites of plants, their synthesis and regulatory mechanisms underlying their production are examined."
Engineering cyanobacteria for production of terpenoids,This review summarizes recent advances in cyanobacterial terpenoid production. The challenges and opportunities of improving terpenoid production by cyanobacteria are discussed.
Environmental Impacts on Plant Volatile Emission,"Plants in their natural environment are often exposed to a variety of environmental stresses. This chapter emphasises the importance of distinguishing among stress effects on constitutive and stress-induced volatile emissions and, within constitutive emissions, among stress effects on emissions from specialised storage compartments (storage emissions) and de novo emissions. Among constitutive emissions, de novo emissions are typically more sensitive to stress than storage emissions. Depending on stress severity, the emission response is either physiological or the emission response is controlled at the gene expression level. This chapter analyses the impacts of heat, cold, drought and waterlogging stresses on constitutive and induced emissions, highlights similarities and differences of various stresses on volatile release and outlines the gaps in knowledge. We argue that for a fully mechanistic understanding of environmental impacts on plant chemical communication channels, more work is needed to obtain quantitative stress dose versus emission responses for different stresses in species of differing stress tolerance."
Essential oil production: relationship with abundance of glandular trichomes in aerial surface of plants,"The terpenoids, or isoprenoids, are a large family of natural products that are best known as constituents of the essential oils in plants. Because of their pleasant flavor and aromatic properties, essential oils have an economic importance in perfumery, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and various other industries. However, expression profiles of regulatory genes in essential oil production have not been dissected entirely, which may be an interesting topic of future research. In this report, we review recent studies on isoprenoids biosynthesis in plants. We also discuss the progress of our recent research activities on isoprenoid studies."
Essential Oils Chemistry,"Essential oils are complex mixtures of volatile compounds produced by aromatic plants and extracted by distillation or expression. More than 3000 essential oils are known with about 300 being commercially relevant as perfume, cosmetic, cleaning, food, and pharmaceutical products. The main trade oils (over 1000 t/year) are those extracted from Citrus aurantifolia, Citrus limon, Citrus sinensis, Cymbopogon nardus, Cymbopogon winterianus, Eucalyptus citriodora, Eucalyptus globulus, Lavandula × intermedia, Mentha canadensis, Mentha × gracilis, Mentha × piperita, Ocotea odorifera, Pogostemon cablin, Sassafras albidum and Syzygium aromaticum. A remarkable progress in the development of analytical methods has contributed to a precise and more reliable characterization of essential oils. Volatile compounds of terpenoid origin, primarily monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, have been identified as hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives in the form of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, peroxydes, and phenols. Also, non-terpenoid compounds namely phenylpropanoids, fatty acids and their esters and, more rarely, nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds are also present. Numerous parameters (physiological, environmental, and genetic factors) influence essential oil composition and in order to ensure the best quality of commercialized oils, specific guidelines have been developed and should be considered."
Essential Oils: An Update on Their Biosynthesis and Genetic Strategies to Overcome the Production Challenges,"Essential oils, secreted by plants, are primarily meant for various physiological, ecological, and defense activities. These oils belong to various classes, i.e., isolates of fatty acids, isoprenoids, and phenolic complexes, and can be secreted by various organs of plants. The essential oil market globally has been predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~8–10%, and reach a staggering figure in excess of USD ten billion in the next 5 years or so. However, the challenge lies in commercial production, keeping pace with the demand, since their natural production in plants is in considerably low quantities, which depends on ecological conditions and growth stages of the plant. Although several investigations exist in the literature, there is a pressing need for a systematic review of the recent updates, particularly concerning the strategies that facilitate the manufacturing of such indispensable oils. The current chapter focuses on various facets of essential oil production, the associated challenges, and the promise of genetic alteration techniques for enhanced essential oil production. Several distinct perspectives have been considered, such as different sources and mechanisms of essential oil biomanufacturing, including their role in plant defense, the array of isolation procedures, and their wide ranges of beneficial attributes, particularly catering to the therapeutic potential, and challenges and metabolic engineering characteristics. A crucial feature of the current chapter is a critical review, underlining these aspects with a case study, using the commercially valuable sandalwood oil as an example, to emphasize the genetic modification strategies for enhancing sandalwood oil."
Exogenous methyl jasmonate prevents necrosis caused by mechanical wounding and increases terpenoid biosynthesis in Panax ginseng,"
Upon mechanical wounding, plants locally induce necrosis, accumulate methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and acquire systemic resistance in nearby tissues. One-month-old in vitro grown Panax ginseng seedlings were treated with either 50 µM MeJA or mechanical wounding alone or a combination of both, to evaluate jasmonic acid (JA) signaling and terpene biosynthetic pathway genes along with terpenoid accumulation. After MeJA treatment, JA pathway genes, such as lipoxygenase (PgLOX), hydrogen peroxidase lyase (PgHPL), allene oxide synthase (PgAOS), and allene oxide cyclase (PgAOC1), and terpene pathway genes, such as isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (PgIPP) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (PgFPS), were highly expressed and resulted in the accumulation of mono- and sesquiterpenes. During mechanical wounding, PgLOX expression was induced relatively late after 72 h of treatment, however PgAOC1 was not induced. This resulted in decreased production of MeJA that in turn may have lowered terpenoid production. In contrast, wounding + MeJA treatment increased PgAOC1 and PgLOX gene expression earlier after 6 h and slowly promoted the production of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Furthermore, we monitored the effect of MeJA upon wounding in in vitro grown 1-month-old seedlings treated with MeJA + wounding. These result demonstrated that exogenous MeJA is able to promote recovery from the wounding effect by functioning as a long distance signal. Additionally, these results suggest that exogenous MeJA supplied at the time of mechanical wounding prevents necrosis in the ginseng leaves by increasing the production of terpenoids.

Floral Scents and Fruit Aromas Inspired by Nature,"Plants use floral and fruit volatiles as chemical cues to interact with their environment by attracting pollinators and seed dispersers, thus ensuring plant reproductive success. These volatiles also have a significant economic value as they contribute directly to the quality, and indirectly to the yield, of crops. The scent of flowers and the aroma of fruits are composed of complex mixtures of tens or sometimes hundreds of volatile compounds, many of which are found in both flowers and fruits. Arising from diverse biochemical pathways, floral and fruit volatiles can be divided into four major classes according to their metabolic origin: terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, fatty acid derivatives and amino acid derivatives. Recent discoveries of genes and enzymes responsible for the formation of volatile compounds have facilitated the investigation of the regulation of the biosynthesis of flower and fruit volatiles. Our growing understanding of the plant volatile network, together with pioneering attempts for fragrance modification, provide a platform for future metabolic engineering of floral scent and fruit aroma for plant improvement and human enjoyment."
Fragrance Stimulation Mechanisms of Flowers and their Regulation Under Environmental Constraints,"Flower fragrance appears as a fascinating facet to attract humans and has significant influence on human lives and in plant reproduction via attracting pollinators to perform fertilization hence, possess substantial economic significance. At present, cultivators are primarily paid for high productivity rather than for fragrance; hence, less attention is given to increase desirable fragrance. However, flower fragrance has received extreme focus of researchers nowadays to gain knowledge about the formation, emission, and regulation of volatile compounds present in the flowers. Various scent controlling genes and scent gene-encoding enzymes that are directly involved in the synthesis of floral volatiles, have been identified in the past two decades. The purpose of the present review is (i) to summarize the need of enhancement in the flower fragrance, (ii) an overview of various floral volatiles biosynthetic pathways and AAAs-derived biosynthetic pathways to mediate floral scent in flowers, (iii) to understand bacterial biochemical transformation involved in the production of floral-scent-related compounds, (iv) to determine the influence of various transcription factors, genes and transporters in the regulation of flower fragrance, and (v) to explore the effect of various environmental factors viz., pollution, temperature, drought etc. on floral scent. Therefore, knowledge about the synthesis and accumulation of various specialized metabolites and their regulatory mechanism is of utmost importance. This will result in regulation and improvement in flowers with respect to their fragrance. Development of genotypes with high or modified flower fragrance is a key target. In addition, improved floral-scent emission is considered as a vital commercial profit. Very few reports are available on flower fragrance enhancement via various biosynthetic products in various cultivars. The present review paper emphasizes the role of various biosynthetic products in the regulation of flower fragrance at both biochemical and molecular levels. We attempt to provide basic information on floral-scent research, which may aid plant scientists and floriculturists to understand potential paths to modulate flower fragrance."
From Molecular Fossils of Bacterial Hopanoids to the Formation of Isoprene Units: Discovery and Elucidation of the Methylerythritol Phosphate Pathway,"Investigations on the biosynthesis of bacterial triterpenoids of the hopane series led to the unexpected discovery of an alternative mevalonate independent pathway for the formation of isoprene units. Methylerythritol phosphate, already presenting the C5 branched isoprene skeleton, is the key intermediate. This pathway was independently characterized in ginkgo embryos for the formation of diterpenoids. It is present in most bacteria and in the plastids of all organisms belonging to phototrophic phyla. The key steps of the discovery and elucidation of this metabolic route are presented in this review."
Functional characterization and expression analysis of two terpene synthases involved in floral scent formation in Lilium ‘Siberia’,Floral scent formation in Lilium ‘Siberia’ is mainly due to monoterpene presence in the floral profile. LoTPS1 and LoTPS3 are responsible for the formation of (±)-linalool and ß-ocimene in Lilium ‘Siberia’.
Functional identification and differential expression of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase in induced terpenoid resin formation of Norway spruce (Picea abies),"Conifers produce terpenoid-based oleoresins as constitutive and inducible defenses against herbivores and pathogens. Much information is available about the genes and enzymes of the late steps of oleoresin terpenoid biosynthesis in conifers, but almost nothing is known about the early steps which proceed via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Here we report the cDNA cloning and functional identification of three Norway spruce (Picea abies) genes encoding 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), which catalyzes the first step of the MEP pathway, and their differential expression in the stems of young saplings. Among them are representatives of both types of plant DXS genes. A single type I DXS gene is constitutively expressed in bark tissue and not affected by wounding or fungal application. In contrast, two distinct type II DXS genes, PaDXS2A and PaDXS2B, showed increased transcript abundance after these treatments as did two other genes of the MEP pathway tested, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and 4-hydroxyl 3-methylbutenyl diphosphate reductase (HDR). We also measured gene expression in a Norway spruce cell suspension culture system that, like intact trees, accumulates monoterpenes after treatment with methyl jasmonate. These cell cultures were characterized by an up-regulation of monoterpene synthase gene transcripts and enzyme activity after elicitor treatment, as well as induced formation of octadecanoids, including jasmonic acid and 12-oxophytodienoic acid. Among the Type II DXS genes in cell cultures, PaDXS2A was induced by treatment with chitosan, methyl salicylate, and Ceratocystis polonica (a bark beetle-associated, blue-staining fungal pathogen of Norway spruce). However, PaDXS2B was induced by treatment with methyl jasmonate and chitosan, but was not affected by methyl salicylate or C. polonica. Our results suggest distinct functions of the three DXS genes in primary and defensive terpenoid metabolism in Norway spruce."
General Overview of Plant Secondary Metabolism,"The aim of this chapter is to ask and answer basic questions about plant secondary metabolism. It attempts to justify its chemical diversity and looks at where and how secondary metabolites are synthesized and stored, at the level of the cell and the whole plant, taking into account the variations in space and time. The question of why plants synthesize secondary metabolites is approached from three points of view: specific physiological functions and intra- and interspecific interactions. The interspecific relations can be plant-plant (allelopathy), plant-microorganisms/fungi and plant-animal. In the overview of the biosynthetic processes, plant secondary metabolites are classified into three basic groups: glucide (glucides, glycosides and the shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway), lipid (acetate malonate pathway and terpenes) and nitrogenated metabolites (non-proteinogenic amino acids, secondary peptides, cyanogenic compounds, glucosinolates and alkaloids)."
Generation of expressed sequence tags for discovery of genes responsible for floral traits of Chrysanthemum morifolium by next-generation sequencing technology,"
                           Chrysanthemum morifolium is one of the most economically valuable ornamental plants worldwide. Chrysanthemum is an allohexaploid plant with a large genome that is commercially propagated by vegetative reproduction. New cultivars with different floral traits, such as color, morphology, and scent, have been generated mainly by classical cross-breeding and mutation breeding. However, only limited genetic resources and their genome information are available for the generation of new floral traits."
Genetic Engineering of BVOC Emissions from Trees,"In recent years, it has become possible to inhibit constitutive production of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) in trees by genetic engineering. In addition, the trait for constitutive emissions has been introduced in several previously non-emitting herbaceous model organisms and crops. Research on these genetically engineered organisms has demonstrated that eliminating terpenes (syn. terpenoids or isoprenoids) emission reduces stress tolerance, while enhancing emissions often increases abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. In this chapter, the progress in terpene engineering work is reviewed, and the advantages of, changes in and obstacles related to genetically modified (GM) trees are discussed. We start by introducing the reader to terpene biosynthesis and the efforts undertaken to manipulate that process, we further review past attempts to repress and overexpress terpene synthases in herbs and trees, and finally describe the current achievements and suggest future possibilities in the field of terpene emission engineering."
Genetic Engineering of Saponin Target Genes to Improve Yields,"Plant is a main source of natural products with diverse chemical structures and biological activities. Among different plant-derived natural products, saponins secondary metabolites are widely distributed across diverse plant species and have great potentials for the pharmaceutical industry, detergents, pesticides and plant disease management. Triterpene glycosides characterized by a 30 carbon atoms, namely oxidosqualene, a major precursor for triterpene aglycone (sapogenin), to which sugar chains are attached to yield the corresponding saponin compounds. However, saponin applications are often limited due to the low yields or accumulation in planta, inadequate of natural resources and the continuous need of the new compounds with superior biological activities. In addition, the biosynthesis and regulatory pathways of the saponin compounds in different plant species are still very limited. Thus development of new methods to improve and diversify the production of saponin glycosides, with a foresight into metabolic engineering, can be an alternative solution to avoid the problem associated with saponin large scale production. In this chapter, we will summarized and discussed the available information regarding saponin engineering in plant and their potential applications for plant disease resistance."
"Genetically engineering cyanobacteria to convert CO2, water, and light into the long-chain hydrocarbon farnesene","Genetically engineered cyanobacteria offer a shortcut to convert CO2 and H2O directly into biofuels and high value chemicals for societal benefits. Farnesene, a long-chained hydrocarbon (C15H24), has many applications in lubricants, cosmetics, fragrances, and biofuels. However, a method for the sustainable, photosynthetic production of farnesene has been lacking. Here, we report the photosynthetic production of farnesene by the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 using only CO2, mineralized water, and light. A codon-optimized farnesene synthase gene was chemically synthesized and then expressed in the cyanobacterium, enabling it to synthesize farnesene through its endogenous non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway. Farnesene excreted from the engineered cyanobacterium volatilized into the flask head space and was recovered by adsorption in a resin column. The maximum photosynthetic productivity of farnesene was 69.1?±?1.8 µg·L-1·O.D.-1·d-1. Compared to the wild type, the farnesene-producing cyanobacterium also exhibited a 60 % higher PSII activity under high light, suggesting increased farnesene productivity in such conditions. We envision genetically engineered cyanobacteria as a bio-solar factory for photosynthetic production of a wide range of biofuels and commodity chemicals."
Genome organization in Arabidopsis thaliana: a survey for genes involved in isoprenoid and chlorophyll metabolism,"The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway provides intermediates for the synthesis of a multitude of natural products which serve numerous biochemical functions in plants: sterols (isoprenoids with a C30 backbone) are essential components of membranes; carotenoids (C40) and chlorophylls (which contain a C20 isoprenoid side-chain) act as photosynthetic pigments; plastoquinone, phylloquinone and ubiquinone (all of which contain long isoprenoid side-chains) participate in electron transport chains; gibberellins (C20), brassinosteroids (C30) and abscisic acid (C15) are phytohormones derived from isoprenoid intermediates; prenylation of proteins (with C15 or C20 isoprenoid moieties) may mediate subcellular targeting and regulation of activity; and several monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and diterpenes (C20) have been demonstrated to be involved in plant defense. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genes coding for enzymes involved in the metabolism of isoprenoid-derived compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana. By combining homology and sequence motif searches with knowledge regarding the phylogenetic distribution of pathways of isoprenoid metabolism across species, candidate genes for these pathways in A. thaliana were obtained. A detailed analysis of the vicinity of chromosome loci for genes of isoprenoid metabolism in A. thaliana provided evidence for the clustering of genes involved in common pathways. Multiple sequence alignments were used to estimate the number of genes in gene families and sequence relationship trees were utilized to classify their individual members. The integration of all these datasets allows the generation of a knowledge-based metabolic map of isoprenoid metabolic pathways in A. thaliana and provides a substantial improvement of the currently available gene annotation."
Genome-wide detection and classification of terpene synthase genes in Aquilaria agallochum,"Agarwood, one of the precious woods in the globe, is produced by Aquilaria plant species during an upshot of wounding and infection. Produced as a defence response, the dark, fragrant resin gets secreted in the plant’s duramen, which is impregnated with fragrant molecules with the due course. Agarwood has gained worldwide popularity due to its high aromatic oil, fragrance, and pharmaceutical value, which makes it highly solicited by numerous industries. Predominant chemical constituents of agarwood, sesquiterpenoids, and 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones have been scrutinized to comprehend the scientific nature of the fragrant wood and develop novel products. However, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of these aromatic compounds are still not comprehensively studied in Aquilaria. In this study, publicly available genomic and transcriptomics data of Aquilaria agallochum were integrated to identify putative functional terpene synthase genes (TPSs). The in silico study enabled us to identify ninety-six TPSs, of which thirty-nine full-length genes were systematically classified into TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, TPS-e, TPS-f, and TPS-g subfamilies based on their gene structure, conserve motif, and phylogenetic comparison with TPSs from other plant species. Analysis of the cis-regulatory elements present upstream of AaTPSs revealed their association with hormone, stress and light responses. In silico expression studies detected their up-regulation in stress induced tissue. This study provides a basic understanding of terpene synthase gene repertoire in Aquilaria agallochum and unlatches opportunities for the biochemical characterization and biotechnological exploration of these genes."
Herbivore-Induced Plant Volatiles to Enhance Biological Control in Agriculture,"Plants under herbivore attack synthetize defensive organic compounds that directly or indirectly affect herbivore performance and mediate other interactions with the community. The so-called herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) consist of odors released by attacked plants that serve as important cues for parasitoids and predators to locate their host/prey. The understanding that has been gained on the ecological role and mechanisms of HIPV emission opens up paths for developing novel strategies integrated with biological control programs with the aim of enhancing the efficacy of natural enemies in suppressing pest populations in crops. Tactics using synthetic HIPVs or chemically/genetically manipulating plant defenses have been suggested in order to recruit natural enemies to plantations or help guiding them to their host more quickly, working as a “synergistic” agent of biological control. This review discusses strategies using HIPVs to enhance biological control that have been proposed in the literature and were categorized here as: (a) exogenous application of elicitors on plants, (b) use of plant varieties that emit attractive HIPVs to natural enemies, (c) release of synthetic HIPVs, and (d) genetic manipulation targeting genes that optimize HIPV emission. We discuss the feasibility, benefits, and downsides of each strategy by considering not only field studies but also comprehensive laboratory assays that present an applied approach for HIPVs or show the potential of employing them in the field."
"Herbivore-induced terpenoid emission in Medicago truncatula: concerted action of jasmonate, ethylene and calcium signaling","Plant volatiles emitted by Medicago truncatula in response to feeding larvae of Spodoptera exigua are composed of a complex blend of terpenoids. The cDNAs of three terpene synthases (TPSs), which contribute to the blend of terpenoids, were cloned from M. truncatula. Their functional characterization proved MtTPS1 to be a ß-caryophyllene synthase and MtTPS5 to be a multi-product sesquiterpene synthase. MtTPS3 encodes a bifunctional enzyme producing (E)-nerolidol and geranyllinalool (precursors of C11 and C16 homoterpenes) from different prenyl diphosphates serving as substrates. The addition of jasmonic acid (JA) induced expression of the TPS genes, but terpenoid emission was higher from plants treated with JA and the ethylene precursor 1-amino-cyclopropyl-1-carboxylic acid. Compared to infested wild-type M. truncatula plants, lower amounts of various sesquiterpenes and a C11–homoterpene were released from an ethylene-insensitive mutant skl. This difference coincided with lower transcript levels of MtTPS5 and of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (MtDXS2) in the damaged skl leaves. Moreover, ethephon, an ethylene-releasing compound, modified the extent and mode of the herbivore-stimulated Ca2+ variations in the cytoplasm that is necessary for both JA and terpene biosynthesis. Thus, ethylene contributes to the herbivory-induced terpenoid biosynthesis at least twice: by modulating both early signaling events such as cytoplasmic Ca2+-influx and the downstream JA-dependent biosynthesis of terpenoids."
Heterologous Production of Plant Terpenes in the Photosynthetic Bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus,"Terpenes are one of the largest classes of secondary metabolites that occur in all kingdoms of life and offer diverse valuable properties for food and pharma industry including pleasant odor or taste as well as antimicrobial or anticancer activities. A multitude of terpene biosynthesis pathways are known, but their efficient biotechnological exploitation requires an adequate microorganism as host which can ideally provide an optimal supply with biosynthetic isoprene precursors. Rhodobacter capsulatus, a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, photosynthetic non-sulfur purple bacterium belonging to the a-proteobacteria represents such a host particularly suitable for terpene production. Here, we describe methods for the expression of terpene biosynthetic enzymes in R. capsulatus and the extraction of products for analysis. At the same time, we summarize the current strategies to adjust the biosynthetic precursor supply via isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways."

Identification of genes related to agarwood formation: transcriptome analysis of healthy and wounded tissues of Aquilaria sinensis,"Agarwood is an expensive resinous heartwood derived from Aquilaria plants that is widely used in traditional medicines, incense and perfume. Only wounded trees can produce agarwood, and the huge demand for the agarwood products has led all Aquilaria spp. being endangered and listed in the Appendix II of the CITES (http://www.cites.org). The major components of agarwood are sesquiterpenes and phenylethyl chromones. Owing to a lack of genomic information, the molecular basis of wound-induced sesquiterpenes biosynthesis and agarwood formation remains unknown."
Identification of QTLs controlling aroma volatiles using a ‘Fortune’ x ‘Murcott’ (Citrus reticulata) population,"Flavor is an important attribute of mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco), but flavor improvement via conventional breeding is very challenging largely due to the complexity of the flavor components and traits. Many aroma associated volatiles of citrus fruit have been identified, which are directly related to flavor, but knowledge of genetic linkages and relevant genes for these volatiles, along with applicable markers potentially for expeditious and economical marker-assisted selection (MAS), is very limited. The objective of this project was to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with these volatile traits."
"Induction of a leaf specific geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase and emission of (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene in tomato are dependent on both jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathways","Two cDNAs encoding geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthases from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) have been cloned and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. LeGGPS1 was predominantly expressed in leaf tissue and LeGGPS2 in ripening fruit and flower tissue. LeGGPS1 expression was induced in leaves by spider mite (Tetranychus urticae)-feeding and mechanical wounding in wild type tomato but not in the jasmonic acid (JA)-response mutant def-1 and the salicylic acid (SA)-deficient transgenic NahG line. Furthermore, LeGGPS1 expression could be induced in leaves of wild type tomato plants by JA- or methyl salicylate (MeSA)-treatment. In contrast, expression of LeGGPS2 was not induced in leaves by spider mite-feeding, wounding, JA- or MeSA-treatment. We show that emission of the GGPP-derived volatile terpenoid (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT) correlates with expression of LeGGPS1. An exception was MeSA-treatment, which resulted in induction of LeGGPS1 but not in emission of TMTT. We show that there is an additional layer of regulation, because geranyllinalool synthase, catalyzing the first dedicated step in TMTT biosynthesis, was induced by JA but not by MeSA."
Insect–Plant Interactions and Role of Secondary Metabolites,"The chapters open with theories of insect–plant association where several theories were discussed. A flow chart of coevolution of plants and insects from the evolution point of view is given with a special note on “hexapod gap.” The structural and functional coevolution of insects in relation to plant evolution is briefly discussed. Evolution of herbivory in insects considering plant as the source of food material to insects and several theories of insect herbivory has been outlined and discussed. Role of insects belonging to different orders, as principal pollinator agent of several terrestrial cross-pollinated plants is reviewed under “Entomophily.” A brief note on deceptive pollination in insects is also touched upon. Plants through the process of evolution has learnt to defend themselves from herbivore attack particularly insects and accordingly role of plant secondary metabolites as a defense against insect herbivore has been discussed in length. Several plant secondary metabolites, their by-products and their role as defense against insect herbivore has been discussed in length."
Insight into the mechanisms of enhanced production of valuable terpenoids by arbuscular mycorrhiza,"
Terpenoids, in addition to being essential for plant growth and survival, are commercially valued for their medicinal properties, ecological significance, and used as flavors and fragrances. Prospective role of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis in improving the accumulation of secondary metabolites especially terpenoids has gained recognition over the past two decades. Increased production of terpenoids in aboveground parts of AM-colonized medicinal plants has extensively been described. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning increase in accumulation of specific terpenoids in AM plants is important for obtaining higher yield and to improve the potential of AM in sustainable cultivation of plants harboring these compounds. Enhanced phosphorus uptake in the mycorrhizal plants has been largely credited for the increase in terpenoid production. However, recent findings have suggested AM mediated manipulation of morphology, biochemistry and gene transcription in plants. The review provides an update on recent findings in the field of AM research with a special focus on production of pharmaceutically important terpenoids. Several points are highlighted for future research to elucidate probable mechanisms underlying increase in terpenoids in mycorrhizal plants."
Introduction to the Different Classes of Biosynthetic Enzymes,"Plant natural products are intimately associated with traits such as quality, yield, disease resistance, stress tolerance, color, and fragrance, in addition to being important dietary components and phytomedicines. In spite of the apparent complexity of natural product biosynthesis, much of the rich chemical diversity of the plant kingdom arises from a limited number of chemical scaffold types, modified by specific chemical substitutions such as hydroxylation, glycosylation, acylation, prenylation, and O-methylation. The molecular genetic basis underlying plant natural product chemistry has recently been the subject of concerted genomic and genetic approaches, facilitated by the fact that many of the key enzymatic steps in scaffold formation and substitution are catalyzed by proteins originating from recognizable gene families (e.g. polyketide synthase, glucosyltransferase) that have undergone significant expansion throughout plant evolution. This overview summarizes the types of enzymatic reactions involved in plant secondary metabolism from a pathway organization perspective that highlights the entry points from primary metabolism, general scaffold formation and scaffold modification (Box 1)."
Introduction to the Different Classes of Natural Products,"Plants produce an enormous variety of natural products with highly diverse structures. These products are commonly termed “secondary metabolites” in contrast to the “primary metabolites” which are essential for plant growth and development. Secondary metabolites were formerly regarded as “waste products” without physiological function for the plant. With the emergence of the field of chemical ecology about 30 years ago, it became evident, however, that these natural products fulfill important functions in the interaction between plants and their biotic and abiotic environment. They can serve, for example, as defense compounds against herbivores and pathogens, as flower pigments that attract pollinators, or as hormones or signal molecules. In addition to their physiological function in plants, natural products also have a strong impact on human culture and have been used throughout human history as condiments, pigments, and pharma­ceuticals."
Introgression of the sesquiterpene biosynthesis from Solanum habrochaites to cultivated tomato offers insights into trichome morphology and arthropod resistance,Cultivated tomatoes harboring the plastid-derived sesquiterpenes from S. habrochaites have altered type-VI trichome morphology and unveil additional genetic components necessary for piercing-sucking pest resistance.
Sandalwood Fragrance Pathway and Its Engineering for Sustainable Production of High-Value Santalols,"The essential oil extracted from the Santalum genus, known as sandalwood oil is one of the most valuable plant-derived secondary metabolites. It is obtained from the steam distillation of the heartwood of the sandalwood tree. The high value of this oil mainly stems from the limited supply, caused by difficulties in the cultivation of the plant and other socio-economic conditions. All species of the Santalum genus, including the highest oil-producing Santalum album (east Indian sandalwood), are very slow-growing that takes about 15–20 years to form heartwood from which oil is distilled. Combined with the loss of cultivatable land and poaching of wild trees make sandalwood oil very valuable. This oil has seen various applications in the aroma, perfume, cosmetic, flavor, and pharmaceutical industries. Though the essential oil of sandalwood constitutes several terpenes and terpene alcohols, the main fragrance-defining constituents of the oil are sesquiterpene alcohols (Z)-a-santalol, (Z)-ß-santalol, (Z)-epi-ß-santalol, and (Z)-a-exo-bergamotol, which are derived from their corresponding sesquiterpenes. In this chapter, we summarise the biosynthetic pathways involved in the formation of terpenoids and genes involved in the formation of key constituents of sandalwood essential oil. We cover different studies carried out toward the complete understanding of the pathway involved in sandalwood oil formation. We also take a look at how the deciphering of the sandalwood oil pathway has enabled bio-engineering approaches for enhanced and sustainable production using various biotechnological strategies."
Secondary Metabolism,"Many authors have discussed the problem of a proper definition of secondary metabolites.1,2,3 Bennett and Bentley1 extensively discussed the history of the term secondary metabolites, with special reference to microbial metabolites. They gave the following definition:
"
Secondary Metabolites from Plant Sources,"A Plant can be considered as a storehouse of a huge number of chemicals biosynthesized by many metabolic pathways like photosynthesis, glycolysis, Kreb’s cycle, shikimic acid pathway, mevalonic acid pathway, etc. Primary metabolites include sugars, citric acid, Kreb's cycle intermediates, amino acids, protein, nucleic acid, and polysaccharides. Primary metabolites are identical in all living plant cells and they carry out basic life activities like growth, cell division, storage, respiration, and reproduction. On the other hand, the secondary plant metabolites, well-known as phytoconstituents are derived from primary metabolites by the influence of various surroundings stress like light, temperature, and different metals with the help of several metabolic pathways. The formation of secondary metabolites is very much specific to the plant family concern. By using similar primary metabolites, plants of various families produce a large number of different secondary metabolites having various pharmaceutical values. Generally, secondary metabolites of the plant have a great role to defense from herbivorous and pathogens, attract other animals and protect from UV radiation. Moreover, secondary metabolites show a lot of importance in the pharmaceutical application as medicines used for the treatment of various diseases in the folklore medicine as well as traditional medicine. They are also used as flavors in pharmaceutical ingredients, perfumes in pharmaceutical and perfumery industry, insecticides, dyes, polymers used for the preparation new drug delivery systems and therefore, they have a great value to economic concern."
Spatial and developmental expression of key genes of terpene biosynthesis in Tanacetum parthenium,"Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) is a medicinal plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. To improve understanding terpene metabolism in feverfew, the relative gene expression of four key genes coding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase (HMGR) and germacrene A synthase (GAS) from the mevalonic acid pathway (MVA), as well as 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate reductase (HDR) from the methyl erythritol phosphate pathway (MEP), were examined. Target organs and tissues included young leaves (not fully expanded), mature leaves (fully expanded), flowers, stems, roots, and glandular trichomes. HMGR, DXR, and HDR were isolated and sequenced for the first time in feverfew. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed differential expression of these genes in feverfew tissues and developmental stages."
Spatial and developmental regulation of putative genes associated with the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes and pyrethrin I in Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium,"Pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium) is a plant from the Asteraceae family discovered as a plant-based insecticidal source which is producing beneficial secondary metabolites such as sesquiterpenes and pyrethrins, hence raised attention due to the insecticidal properties of its secondary metabolites. To improve our knowledge about the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes and pyrethrin I, we directed a survey to analyze the gene expression in different developmental stages of leaves and also in chloroform dipped leaves (to remove glandular trichomes). Along with this, histochemical experiments were carried out on leaves to detect the accumulation site of lipids, monoterpene phenols, and sesquiterpenes. Gene expression results showed that chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDS), and 13-Lipoxygenase (13-LOX) putative genes were highly expressed in intact leaves (leaves with glandular trichomes). In contrast, their expression significantly decreased in chloroform dipped leaves (without glandular trichomes). Also, the higher expression of genes that are related to the biosynthetic pathways of sesquiterpenes and pyrethrin I was observed in young leaves compared with the leaflets and fully-expanded leaves. The obtained results demonstrate that glandular trichomes’ relative density changes markedly during the developmental stages of leaves and, consequently, influences the transcript levels of trichome-specific genes."
"Secondary Metabolites: Secondary Metabolic Products Consisting of C and H; C, H, and O; N, S, and P Elements; and O/N Heterocycles","Terpenes and terpenoids, steroids and sterols, volatile oils, miscellaneous isoprenoids, phenols and phenyl propanoids, alkaloids, glycosides, bitter principles, resins, saponins, cardioactive compounds, etc., are important groups of secondary metabolites of plant origin. Terpenes and terpenoids are naturally occurring hydrocarbons, and ~2000 plant species of 60 families produce more than 55,000 terpenes and their derivatives. Terpenes are built from isoprene monomer (C5H8), and (C5H8)n. is the basic molecular formula. The oxygen-containing terpenes are called terpenoids or isoprenoids while steroids are cyclic terpenoids, and sterols are steroid alcohols. Terpenoids have significant importance in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industry. Terpenoids contribute to plant essential oils (eucalyptus, lavender, thyme, and mint), flavors (cinnamon, cloves, and ginger), color (yellow—sunflowers, red—tomatoes), etc. They protect plant against predators and pests (e.g., from herbivores, insects, fungi, microorganisms, etc.), aid to pollination and dispersal of spores, and in living organisms function range from pigments and fragrances to vitamins and precursors of sex hormones. Plant sterols, including campesterol, inhibit the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines and thereby reduce LDLs or cholesterol level. Phenols or phenolics are a class of chemical compounds with a benzene nucleus supporting a hydroxyl group and range from simple substances like phenolic acids or phenols, cumarines, flavonoids, and quinines to very complex ones such as lignins and tannins. Phenol and its chemical derivatives are used in the production of detergents, phenoxy herbicides, numerous pharmaceutical drugs, and many industrial synthetic goods. Alkaloids are cyclic bitter organic compounds containing nitrogen in a negative state of oxidation having a marked physiological action on man and other animals. A large variety of organisms produce alkaloids, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Alkaloids like caffeine, ephedrine, codeine, colchicine, nicotine, pilocarpine, opium, quinine, reserpine, cocaine, psilocin morphine, atropine, berberine, vincristine, yohimbine, etc., are some common examples of drugs principles of pharmaceutical importance and often are used as recreational drugs, or in entheogenic rituals. A glycoside is a heteromolecule consisting of a non-sugar (aglycone) and a sugar part (glycone) components. The glycone may be monosaccharide or oligosaccharide, and the aglycone may be an alcohol, anthraquinone derivative, phenol, aldehyde, acid, ester, or another compound. Glycosides play numerous important roles in living organisms, and many such plant glycosides are used as medications, e.g., the active principles of digitalis, strophanthus, cascara, willow, and poplar barks are being among the most valued remedies. The bitter principles are mostly terpenoid, especially the sesquiterpene lactones, monoterpene iridoids, and the secoiridoids. Diterpene bitters are found in columbo root and white horehound, and triterpenoids are the cause of bitterness in Cucurbitaceous plants, which is due to cucurbitacins. Plant lignans are diphenolic compounds (phenylpropanoids dimers) whose structure is the union of two units of phenylpropane. Tannins are non-nitrogenous bitter plant polyphenolic compounds having a molecular weight between 500 and 3000 (gallic acid esters) and up to 20,000 (proanthocyanidins). They are non-crystallisable colloidal compounds and may be (i) hydrolyzable tannins, which consist of gallic acid or related polyhydric compounds esterified with glucose, and they are readily hydrolysed to yield the phenolic acids and the sugar; and (ii) non-hydrolyzable or condensed tannins contain only phenolic nuclei and most of such tannins are formed by the condensation of two or more flavanols, such as catechin. Pharmaceutically, tannins have antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic, astringent, and antiseptic properties, and may be used in the treatment of hemorrhages (constrict of blood vessels), burns (cicatrizing), diarrhea, and as an antidote for alkaloid poisoning because of their ability to precipitate alkaloids; effective against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced toxicity and also have anti-inflammatory and antiulcer activity. Quinones are cyclic organic compounds (aromatic diketones) and are found in bacteria, in certain fungi, in various higher plant forms, and in a few animals (e.g., sea urchins, aphids, lac insects, and certain scale insects). It is highly active anti-microbacterial, antifungal agent and highly toxic and fatal if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin and widely used in medicine, herbicides, chemical reagents, dyes, and tanning agents. Saponins are amphiphilic glucoside molecules composed of hydrophilic glycoside glycone and lipophilic triterpene or steroid aglycone. Saponins have been used in medicine, foaming agents, in fire extinguishers, and fish poisons. Drugs that influence heart or drugs having an influence on the heart are cardioactive drugs. (i) Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, (ii) calcium channel blocking drugs, and (iii) cardiac glycosides are three major classes of cardioactive drugs. Cardiac glycosides are also important in the pathogenesis and therapy of different human diseases (e.g., stroke, diabetes, neurological diseases, cancer, etc.). Cardioactive steroids are a class of animal and plant-derived compounds with a steroid nucleus and a specific inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effect. Cardioactive steroids (CAS) became the mainstay of treatment for congestive heart failure and to control the ventricular response rate in atrial tachydysrhythmias. Antibiotics are produced by different groups of microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes and in many cases by higher plants. Antibiotics in low concentration are capable of inhibiting the growth of microorganisms through an antimetabolic mechanism. They differ from antiseptics and disinfectants in their mode of action, chemical, and physical properties. The development of resistance among the microorganisms on prolonged contact with the drug is the present-day problems in the field of antibiotics. The microbial and plant sources from the terrestrial and marine environments are now providing natural products with antitumor activity.

Sesquiterpene lactone engineering in microbial and plant platforms: parthenolide and artemisinin as case studies,"Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are one of the most diverse groups of secondary metabolites that mainly have been observed in the Asteraceae. They are composed of a C15 skeleton bearing functional groups, e.g., hydroxy, keto, or epoxy. Sesquiterpene lactones have been shown to display several biological activities; hence, their therapeutic effects are indispensable. To overcome low yield of sesquiterpene lactone content in native plants, manipulation of their biosynthetic pathway(s) has become an interesting approach for many researchers. Several genetic engineering strategies have been used in plants or microbial systems for elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway and high-level production of sesquiterpene lactones. Here, we will introduce ongoing research and perspectives about the manipulation of sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis by various non-traditional metabolic engineering strategies, along with successful examples of high-yield production of sesquiterpene lactones mainly focused on parthenolide and artemisinin in plants and microorganisms."
Structural and biochemical perspectives in plant isoprenoid biosynthesis,"The isoprenoid family represents one of the most ancient and widespread classes of structurally and functionally rich biomolecules known to man. Although these natural products are synthesized in all organisms, the plant kingdom exhibits tremendous variation in their chemistry and roles, ranging from primary metabolism to secondary metabolism and specialized ecological interactions with the environment. Despite enormous diversity in structure and function, all isoprenoids are derived from the universal C5 precursor isoprene. The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway has three major stages, viz., (1) synthesis of the isoprene building blocks, followed by their (2) assembly into flexible linear and branched hydrocarbon substrates, which then undergo (3) multistep reaction cascades to generate the vast assortment of isoprenoid end products. One of the most interesting aspects of isoprenoid biosynthesis is its being finely tuned by a multilayered and complex regulatory network, which excellently controls the machinery producing one of the most heterogeneous groups of molecules in plants. Terpene synthases, enzymes of the final stage, are key players in the generation of isoprenoid diversity, catalyzing one of the most complex reactions known to chemistry and biology. Unraveling the mechanism by which a minimal pool of substrates is thus converted into tens of thousands of regiospecific and stereospecific products, is a promising research avenue: This knowledge may be practically used for rational design of novel compounds by metabolic engineering, in order to yield plants with improved nutritional efficacy, stress resistance, bio-pharmaceutical properties etc. This review is an attempt to summarize the biochemical, molecular, physiological, structural, genomic and evolutionary aspects of isoprenoid biosynthesis, providing new insights into how these enzymes utilize various innovative strategies for creation of the so-called final terpenome."
Synthetic Biology Advances for Enrichment of Bioactive Molecules in Plants,"Plant bioactive molecules are secondary metabolites that have pharmacological effects on human beings. Three types of secondary metabolites are present in plant systems: terpenes, alkaloids, and phenylpropanoids. They may not be very crucial for plant growth and development aspects, but are needful for survivability and fecundity. These pharmaceutical molecules are useful in the development of drug and other herbal preparations of potential health benefits. These phytomedicines are known to exert minimal side effects and enormous positive effectiveness to human health; therefore, their utility is enhancing day by day. Currently, many drug formulations contain plant bioactive molecules as a sole ingredient, covering more than 50% of the medicine-market. Despite the demand of secondary metabolites in the market, their supply is limited from the natural sources; therefore, technologies are required to enhance their production. Although advance breeding and biotechnological tools are being applied to enhance the biosynthetic level of bioactive molecules, synthetic biology offers a promising approach for production of these metabolites at substantial scale. Synthetic biology is a branch of biology and engineering, useful in designing and constructing modulated metabolic pathways and bioengineering of biological systems for the production of bioactive molecules. This chapter discusses about the plant bioactive molecules, their types, biosynthetic pathways, and significance. The molecular biology approaches used for production of the secondary metabolites have been summarized in this chapter. It also covers the systems and tools, which are used in synthetic biology technique for upscaling of the selected metabolites. Further, the case studies of the biosynthetic production of high-value biomolecules and the future perspectives of synthetic biology have been discussed."
Temporal Dynamics of Plant Volatiles: Mechanistic Bases and Functional Consequences,"Plant volatiles comprise thousands of low-molecular weight, hydrophobic molecules that are classified as ‘secondary’ (specialized) metabolites, but are closely related to ‘primary’ (general) metabolites such as fatty acids, amino acids, sterols and carotenoids. In addition to having important physiological functions, these specialized small molecules have a large influence on plants’ ecological interactions. By emitting particular blends of volatiles, plants can provide detailed information about their current physiological and ecological states and even manipulate other organisms. In fact, the timing of volatile biosynthesis and emission may be as critical to function as the amount and composition of volatile blends. Here, we critically review the known and hypothesized effects of phenological changes in plant volatile emission, their regulation and importance for function."
"Terpene profiling, transcriptome analysis and characterization of cis-ß-terpineol synthase from Ocimum","Ocimum species produces a varied mix of different metabolites that imparts immense medicinal properties. To explore this chemo-diversity, we initially carried out metabolite profiling of different tissues of five Ocimum species and identified the major terpenes. This analysis broadly classified these five Ocimum species into two distinct chemotypes namely, phenylpropanoid-rich and terpene-rich. In particular, ß-caryophyllene, myrcene, limonene, camphor, borneol and selinene were major terpenes present in these Ocimum species. Subsequently, transcriptomic analysis of pooled RNA samples from different tissues of Ocimum gratissimum, O. tenuiflorum and O. kilimandscharicum identified 38 unique transcripts of terpene synthase (TPS) gene family. Full-length gene cloning, followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of three TPS transcripts were carried out along with their expression in various tissues. Terpenoid metabolite and expression profiling of candidate TPS genes in various tissues of Ocimum species revealed spatial variances. Further, putative TPS contig 19414 (TPS1) was selected to corroborate its role in terpene biosynthesis. Agrobacterium-mediated transient over-expression assay of TPS1 in the leaves of O. kilimandscharicum and subsequent metabolic and gene expression analyses indicated it as a cis-ß-terpineol synthase. Overall, present study provided deeper understanding of terpene diversity in Ocimum species and might help in the enhancement of their terpene content through advanced biotechnological approaches."
Terpenes and isoprenoids: a wealth of compounds for global use,"Role of terpenes and isoprenoids has been pivotal in the survival and evolution of higher plants in various ecoregions. These products find application in the pharmaceutical, flavor fragrance, and biofuel industries."
Terpenes and Terpenoids,"Terpenes and their derivatives, the terpenoids, are synthetized from a five carbon atom isoprene unit. These units are added to each other to give rise to compounds of different complexities. The synthesis takes place either in the cytosol (MVA pathway) or within the plastids (MEP pathway). Monoterpenes, diterpenes and tetraterpenes are products from the MEP pathway, whereas sesquiterpenes, sterols and triterpenes are derivatives from the MVA pathway. Tailoring enzymes leads to the variations observed. End products are important for plant growth such as hormones (gibberellin and brassinosteroids) or carotenoids. They can be simpler structures, which are sometimes also volatile (such as menthol or ß-caryophyllene) or more complex, even polycyclic (such as ryanodine or stigmasterol)."
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Volatile Messengers in Trees,"All tree species possess genes encoding terminal enzymes responsible for volatile isoprenoid synthesis. However, only in some species, these genes are expressed constitutively in leaves, while terpenoid emissions can be triggered by abiotic and biotic stress factor in essentially all species. This chapter analyses the biochemical diversity of volatile isoprenoid synthases and investigates the genomic modifications responsible for constitutive volatile production in trees. Plant terpenoids are up to three-domain proteins with either one active center in monofunctional synthases, or two active centers in bifunctional synthases. There is evidence of monophyletic origin of modern plant terpenoid synthases from a three-domain synthase in an ancient progenitor followed by extensive gene duplication and domain loss. The terpenoid synthase sequence similarity can be low among distant plant groups, but terpenoid tertiary structure is remarkably similar in different synthases, and this structural similarity is even conserved across domains of life. However, only minor changes in active center structure can lead to major changes in product profiles, indicating that presence of rich terpenoid genetic diversity constitutes an important means for rapid evolutionary adaptations to novel biotic interactions, and to new abiotic stresses in plant habitats."
The Domain of Bacteria and Their Volatile Metabolic Potential,"The ability to produce volatile compounds is widely distributed among bacteria. A comprehensive summary of volatiles reported to be emitted by different fungal and bacterial species can be found in the mVOC database (http://bioinformatics.charite.de/mvoc). This chapter aims to summarize different features of bacterial phyla, classes, families, and genera present in the mVOC database and review the different habitats where volatile producers have been isolated from. As a result, bacteria belonging to the phylum of Proteobacteria were the most studied mVOC producers. Moreover, soil, marine environments, and the human body turned out to be the main isolation sources of the microbes compiled in the mVOC database. Additionally, general biosynthetic routes from the primary as well as secondary metabolism are presented which ultimately can result in the production of microbial volatile metabolites."
The Impact of Induced Plant Volatiles on Plant-Arthropod Interactions,"Plants release volatile organic compounds from their vegetative tissues into their environment during most of their life cycle. The functions of these volatiles are diverse and not always known but some of these volatiles repel foraging herbivores while others, in turn, attract them and are feeding stimuli. Upon herbivory the amount of volatiles increases dramatically while, simultaneously, also the composition of the blend changes thereby enhancing the attractiveness of the plant to foraging natural enemies and in some cases increasing repellency to herbivores. Hence, herbivore-induced volatiles promote a natural form of biological pest control referred to as “indirect plant defense” and it has often been suggested that this phenomenon could be exploited to enhance crop protection. Here we will introduce the concept of indirect plant defense via volatiles and via other means and outline the current state of knowledge to the extent in which it contributes to protecting a plant to maximize its fitness under natural conditions in an evolutionary and ecological context. Moreover we will summarize the different approaches that have been undertaken to manipulate indirect defenses, either via application of synthetic volatiles or via transgenic manipulation of plant-volatile production, to control the movements of foraging arthropods to improve biological control. Finally, we will discuss to which extent IPM can be improved or even be disrupted via manipulation of plant volatiles."
The molecular and biochemical basis for varietal variation in sesquiterpene content in melon (Cucumis melo L.) rinds,"A combined chemical, biochemical and molecular study was conducted to understand the differential accumulation of volatile sesquiterpenes in melon fruits. Sesquiterpenes were present mainly in the rinds of climacteric varieties, and a great diversity in their composition was found among varieties. Sesquiterpenes were generally absent in non-climacteric varieties. Two climacteric melon varieties, the green-fleshed ‘Noy Yizre'el’, and the orange-fleshed ‘Dulce’ were further examined. In ‘Noy Yizre'el’ the main sesquiterpenes accumulated are d-cadinene, ?-cadinene and a-copaene, while a-farnesene is the main sesquiterpene in ‘Dulce’. Sesquiterpene synthase activities, mainly restricted to rinds of mature fruits, were shown to generate different sesquiterpenes in each variety according to the compositions found in rinds. EST melon database mining yielded two novel cDNAs coding for members of the Tps gene family termed CmTpsNY and CmTpsDul respectively, that are 43.2% similar. Heterologous expression in E. coli of CmTpsNY produced mainly d-copaene, a-copaene, ß-caryophyllene, germacrene D, a-muurolene, ?-cadinene, d-cadinene, and a-cadinene, while CmTpsDul produced a-farnesene only. CmTpsNY was mostly expressed in ‘Noy Yizre'el’ rind while CmTpsDul expression was specific to ’Dulce’ rind. None of these genes was expressed in rinds of the non-climacteric ‘Tam Dew’ cultivar. Our results indicate that different sesquiterpene synthases encoded by different members of the Tps gene family are active in melon varieties and this specificity modulates the accumulation of sesquiterpenes. The genes are differentially transcriptionally regulated during fruit development and according to variety and are likely to be associated with chemical differences responsible for the unique aromas of melon varieties."
"The Phytochemical Composition, Biological Effects and Biotechnological Approaches to the Production of High-Value Essential Oil from Geranium","Geraniaceae family plants are highly reputed aromatic and medicinal perennial branched herbs. The high economic value of these plants is due to their secondary metabolites, especially essential oil of foliage, which is a complex mixture of volatile phytochemicals, such as terpenes, esters, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones and phenols. The main phytoconstituents of the essential oil belong to the terpenoid group of metabolites, such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and their esters. Of these, geraniol, linalool, citronellol and their esters (50–70%) generally constitute a major portion of essential oil, responsible for its fragrance. Essential oil is biosynthesized in specialized tissues known as glandular trichomes present in leaves, green branches and fresh flowers. Geraniaceae family plants have been highly useful in the perfumery, cosmetics, aromatherapy, pharmaceuticals and food industries. Several pharmacological properties such as antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerous, anti-depressant, antibacterial, antioxidant, antiseptic, anti-dysentery, and antidiabetic properties are attributed to the presence of geranium oil. Further, it improves blood circulation, treats congestion, cleans the lymphatic system, strengthens the immune system, and is effective in combating nervousness, constipation, insomnia, anxiety and high blood pressure. The chapter discusses the phytochemical composition, pharmacological properties, genomics of essential oil biosynthetic pathway, enhancement of essential oil yield, and several biotechnological approaches to enhance the quantity as well as quality of essential oil in geranium."
The timing of herbivore-induced volatile emission in black poplar (Populus nigra) and the influence of herbivore age and identity affect the value of individual volatiles as cues for herbivore enemies,"The role of herbivore-induced plant volatiles as signals mediating the attraction of herbivore enemies is a well-known phenomenon. Studies with short-lived herbaceous plant species have shown that various biotic and abiotic factors can strongly affect the quantity, composition and timing of volatile emission dynamics. However, there is little knowledge on how these factors influence the volatile emission of long-lived woody perennials."
The transcriptome of flower development provides insight into floral scent formation in Freesia hybrida,"Freesia hybrida is a popular cut flower that is globally cultivated. Despite fragrance being an important floral trait, little is known of its associated molecular mechanisms in F. hybrida. In this study, cDNA libraries were constructed for three floral developmental stages in F. hybrida. A total of 74,660 unigenes were obtained from RNA sequencing and de novo assembly, of which 72.20% were annotated by seven public protein databases. Approximately 12,420 differentially expressed genes were identified during flower development. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis detected a total of 34 floral volatile compounds, primarily volatile monoterpenes, which accounted for approximately 90% of the volatiles. Using a system analysis-based approach, 36 candidate genes related to volatile terpenes were identified, in which the majority of up-regulated genes associated with the biosynthesis of monoterpenes and the majority of down-regulated genes associated with the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes. Of these, FhDXS2A, FhGPPs and FhTPSs were considered to be important in floral scent formation. This study provides an in-depth assessment of floral scent and a reference for the future molecular breeding of floral scent in ornamental plants."
Therapeutic and Medicinal Uses of Terpenes,"Terpenes, also known as terpenoids are the largest and most diverse group of naturally occurring compounds. Based on the number of isoprene units they have, they are classified as mono, di, tri, tetra, and sesquiterpenes. They are mostly found in plants and form the major constituent of essential oils from plants. Among the natural products that provide medical benefits for an organism, terpenes play a major and variety of roles. The common plant sources of terpenes are tea, thyme, cannabis, Spanish sage, and citrus fruits (e.g., lemon, orange, mandarin). Terpenes have a wide range of medicinal uses among which antiplasmodial activity is notable as its mechanism of action is similar to the popular antimalarial drug in use—chloroquine. Monoterpenes specifically are widely studied for their antiviral property. With growing incidents of cancer and diabetes in modern world, terpenes also have the potential to serve as anticancer and antidiabetic reagents. Along with these properties, terpenes also allow for flexibility in route of administration and suppression of side effects. Certain terpenes were widely used in natural folk medicine. One such terpene is curcumin which holds anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, antiplasmodial, astringent, digestive, diuretic, and many other properties. Curcumin has also become a recent trend in healthy foods and open doors for several medical researches. This chapter summarizes the various terpenes, their sources, medicinal properties, mechanism of action, and the recent studies that are underway for designing terpenes as a lead molecule in the modern medicine."
Tomato linalool synthase is induced in trichomes by jasmonic acid,"Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants emit a blend of volatile organic compounds, which mainly consists of terpenes. Upon herbivory or wounding, the emission of several terpenes increases. We have identified and characterized the first two tomato monoterpene synthases, LeMTS1 and LeMTS2. Although these proteins were highly homologous, recombinant LeMTS1 protein produced (R)-linalool from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (E)-nerolidol from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), while recombinant LeMTS2 produced ß-phellandrene, ß-myrcene, and sabinene from GPP. In addition, these genes were expressed in different tissues: LeMTS1 was expressed in flowers, young leaves, stems, and petioles, while LeMTS2 was strongest expressed in stems and roots. LeMTS1 expression in leaves was induced by spider mite-infestation, wounding and jasmonic acid (JA)-treatment, while LeMTS2 did not respond to these stimuli. The expression of LeMTS1 in stems and petioles was predominantly detected in trichomes and could be induced by JA. Because JA treatment strongly induced emission of linalool and overexpression of LeMTS1 in tomato resulted in increased production of linalool, we propose that LeMTS1 is a genuine linalool synthase. Our results underline the importance of trichomes in JA-induced terpene emission in tomato."
Toward a photosynthetic microbial platform for terpenoid engineering,"Plant terpenoids are among the most diverse group of naturally-occurring organic compounds known, and several are used in contemporary consumer products. Terpene synthase enzymes catalyze complex rearrangements of carbon skeleton precursors to yield thousands of unique chemical structures that range in size from the simplest five carbon isoprene unit to the long polymers of rubber. Such chemical diversity has established plant terpenoids as valuable commodity chemicals with applications in the pharmaceutical, neutraceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. More recently, terpenoids have received attention as a renewable alternative to petroleum-derived fuels and as the building blocks of synthetic biopolymers. However, the current plant- and petrochemical-based supplies of commodity terpenoids have major limitations. Photosynthetic microorganisms provide an opportunity to generate terpenoids in a renewable manner, employing a single consolidated host organism that is able to use solar energy, H2O and CO2 as the primary inputs for terpenoid biosynthesis. Advances in synthetic biology have seen important breakthroughs in microbial terpenoid engineering, traditionally via fermentative pathways in yeast and Escherichia coli. This review draws on the knowledge obtained from heterotrophic microbial engineering to propose strategies for the development of microbial photosynthetic platforms for industrial terpenoid production. The importance of utilizing the wealth of genetic information provided by nature to unravel the regulatory mechanisms of terpenoid biosynthesis is highlighted."
Transcriptional responses and flavor volatiles biosynthesis in methyl jasmonate-treated tea leaves,"Tea (Camellia sinensis) has long been consumed worldwide for its amazing flavor and aroma. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which acts as an effective elicitor among the plant kingdom, could mostly improve the quality of tea aroma by promoting flavor volatiles in tea leaves. Although a variety of volatile secondary metabolites that contribute to aroma quality have been identified, our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of these compounds has remained largely incomplete. Therefore, information aboaut the transcriptome of tea leaves and, specifically, details of any changes in gene expression in response to MeJA, is required for a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of MeJA-mediated volatiles biosynthesis. Moreover, MeJA treatment could exaggerate the responses of secondary metabolites and some gene expression which offer a better chance to figure out the mechanism."
Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses provide insight into the volatile compounds of citrus leaves and flowers,"Previous reports have mainly focused on the volatiles in citrus fruits, and there have been few reports about the volatiles in citrus leaves and flowers. However, citrus leaves and flowers are also rich in volatile compounds with unique aromas. Here, to investigate the volatiles in citrus leaves and flowers, volatile profiling was performed on leaves from 62 germplasms and flowers from 25 germplasms."
Unravelling the functions of biogenic volatiles in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems,"Living trees are the main source of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) in forest ecosystems, but substantial emissions originate from leaf and wood litter, the rhizosphere and from microorganisms. This review focuses on temperate and boreal forest ecosystems and the roles of BVOCs in ecosystem function, from the leaf to the forest canopy and from the forest soil to the atmosphere level. Moreover, emphasis is given to the question of how BVOCs will help forests adapt to environmental stress, particularly biotic stress related to climate change. Trees use their vascular system and emissions of BVOCs in internal communication, but emitted BVOCs have extended the communication to tree population and whole community levels and beyond. Future forestry practices should consider the importance of BVOCs in attraction and repulsion of attacking bark beetles, but also take an advantage of herbivore-induced BVOCs to improve the efficiency of natural enemies of herbivores. BVOCs are extensively involved in ecosystem services provided by forests including the positive effects on human health. BVOCs have a key role in ozone formation but also in ozone quenching. Oxidation products form secondary organic aerosols that disperse sunlight deeper into the forest canopy, and affect cloud formation and ultimately the climate. We also discuss the technical side of reliable BVOC sampling of forest trees for future interdisciplinary studies that should bridge the gaps between the forest sciences, health sciences, chemical ecology, conservation biology, tree physiology and atmospheric science."
Use of cyclodextrins to improve the production of plant bioactive compounds,"Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of D-glucopyranose units bound via a-(1,4)-glycosidic linkages. They are obtained from starch enzymatic degradation by the action of cyclodextrinases or glycosyltransferases. Among the modified-cyclodextrins, 2-hydroxypropylated and methylated ß-cyclodextrins are produced on industrial scale. Particularly, methylated ß-cyclodextrins are more suitable than native ß-cyclodextrins to form stable inclusion complexes with organic molecules of low molecular weight, making these complexes more soluble in aqueous solutions. Cyclodextrins have often been considered useful carriers of antitumor- and immuno-regulatory drugs, and they have also been used as additives for food industry. It is also important to note that cyclodextrins are used for improving bioactive compound production in plant cell cultures because of cyclodextrins ability as “hosts” of bioactive compounds favoring their accumulation in aqueous media. In fact, the treatment of plant cell cultures with cyclodextrins and their derivatives increases the production of secondary metabolites such as resveratrol, ajmalicine, serpentine, lutein, arachidin, among other antioxidant compounds, enhancing the capability of plant in vitro cultures to produce high levels of different bioactive compounds which have beneficial properties for human health. In addition, metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies have been carried out on both control and cyclodextrins-treated cell cultures offering important clues about how cyclodextrins are capable of substantially increasing the production of bioactive compounds in plant in vitro cultures. This review focuses on the effect of cyclodextrins on both bioactive compound production and their accumulation, which could be of great interest for chemical and pharmaceutical industries."
Using the combined analysis of transcripts and metabolites to propose key genes for differential terpene accumulation across two regions,"Terpenes are of great interest to winemakers because of their extremely low perception thresholds and pleasant floral odors. Even for the same variety, terpene profile can be substantially different for grapevine growing environments. Recently a series of genes required for terpene biosynthesis were biochemically characterized in grape berries. However, the genes that dominate the differential terpene accumulation of grape berries between regions have yet to be identified."
"Volatile terpenoids: multiple functions, biosynthesis, modulation and manipulation by genetic engineering","
                  Terpenoids play several physiological and ecological functions in plant life through direct and indirect plant defenses and also in human society because of their enormous applications in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics industries. Through the aid of genetic engineering its role can by magnified to broad spectrum by improving genetic ability of crop plants, enhancing the aroma quality of fruits and flowers and the production of pharmaceutical terpenoids contents in medicinal plants.

Volatiles Emission Patterns in Poplar Clones Varying in Response to Ozone,"The volatiles emitted from young and old leaves of two poplar clones (Populus deltoides x maximowiczii, Eridano, and P. x euramericana, I-214) were sampled after exposure to ozone (80 ppb, 5 h?d-1, for 10 consecutive days) by solid phase microextraction and characterized by GC-MS. Only mature leaves of the ozone-sensitive Eridano clone developed necrosis in response to ozone exposure, and their membrane integrity was significantly affected by ozone (+86 and +18 % of levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in mature and young leaves). The headspace of the poplar clones studied here contained mono- and sesquiterpenes, both hydrocarbons and oxygenated ones in Eridano, and only hydrocarbons in the clone I-214. Furthermore, some non-terpenes, such as C9-C15 straight-chain aldehydes and C12-C16 saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, were detected. Other common non-terpene volatiles were oxygenated aliphatic compounds, mainly C6-alcohols and their acetates. Ozone exposure induced a strong change in volatile profiles, depending on clones and leaf age. Regardless of leaf age, in clone I-214, quantities of oxygenated monoterpenes tended to increase after ozone exposure, however, “O3 x leaf age” was not significant. In clone Eridano, increases were observed in emissions of hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes in response to ozone treatment. (Z)-3-Hexen-1-ol and (Z)-3-hexenol acetate were present in traces in the headspace of untreated Eridano mature leaves, but quantities slightly increased after ozone treatment. Quantities of non-terpene oxygenated compounds dropped in the headspace of young leaves of both clones (-24 and -44 % in Eridano and I-214) and also in mature ones of I-214 (-50 %) after ozone exposure. Similarly, quantities of non-terpene hydrocarbons in the emissions from mature leaves of both clones (-58 and -49 %, respectively) decreased, while these compounds increased in young leaves of Eridano (+83 %). We suggest that the resistance of the poplar clone I-214 to O3 is achieved by: i) monoterpenes constitutively present in young leaves and ii) increase of monoterpene content induced by O3 in mature leaves."
What Are Plant-Released Biogenic Volatiles and How They Participate in Landscape- to Global-Level Processes?,"Plants face a multitude of abiotic and biotic stresses with varying severity throughout their life, and these stresses can result in varying changes to the ecosystem services provided by the plants. Climate change involves modification of several environmental drivers, and it is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of various abiotic and biotic stresses, including rising temperatures, increasingly uneven distribution of precipitation, and more frequent outbreaks of herbivore and pathogen attacks. As any stress reduces plant CO2 fixation, enhanced stress frequency and severity are expected to lead to faster rise of atmospheric CO2 concentration, thereby further exacerbating climate change. On the other hand, plants can importantly modify their own life environment by release of volatile organic compounds (BVOC). The plant-generated volatiles modify the oxidative status of the ambient atmosphere by enhancing the rate of ozone formation in atmospheres polluted by mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx). From this perspective, plant emissions can be considered as ecosystem “disservice.” Plant-emitted volatiles also importantly participate in aerosol and cloud formation in both polluted and non-polluted atmospheres, thereby reducing solar radiation penetration and ambient temperature. Plant-facilitated cooling can partly counteract global warming, and thus, plant emissions provide an important global regulatory ecosystem service. Apart from constitutive volatile emissions that are present in only some species and are expected to decrease under stress, especially under severe stress, all plants respond to stresses by inducing BVOC emissions that serve as signal molecules eliciting stress response pathways and leading to plant acclimation. These induced BVOC emissions, the plant “talk,” also contribute to atmospheric processes and can potentially reduce the stress severity, and, accordingly, stress-driven reductions in CO2 uptake. Thus, the stress responses and acclimation of vegetation to future environmental stresses can importantly modify the speed and magnitude of climate change."
A current opinion on the antimicrobial importance of popular pepper essential oil and its application in food industry,"Food safety is a fundamental concern of consumers, regulatory agencies, and the food industry. Increasing the morbidity of foodborne diseases, coupled with economic implications, makes continual efforts for safer foods production and developing new antimicrobial agents necessary. The alternatives to chemical preservatives are natural ones that are nontoxic, such as pepper. Pepper essential oils can be used both as flavor improvement agents and as efficient preservatives of food products. The present review attempts to provide an overview of the most bioactive ingredients of pepper essential oils and to describe their mode of hypothetical antimicrobial action. We examined data from the literature to understand the complex mechanism of interaction between bioactive compounds of pepper and microbes. The novel application possibilities of pepper oils in food technology, especially in meat, fish, and vegetable processing, were also described."
"Antioxidant, a-amylase, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of Hertia cheirifolia essential oils: Influence of plant organs and seasonal variation","Hertia cheirifolia is an endemic medicinal species of the Tunisian and Algerian flora. The species was found to be rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons and sesquiterpene lactones. Significant variation of essential oil composition was observed between the plant organs. Flower buds were characterized by the highest content of the drimane type (34.08%). Leaf essential oil showed the uppermost percentage of a-pinene (35.63%). Flowers and flower buds exhibited the highest amount of germacrene D (13.18 and 12.80%, respectively). The composition of leaf essential oil varied significantly depending on the harvesting time. The lowest amount of a-pinene (19.49%) and the uppermost contents of drimenin (36.16%) and the drimane type (29.14%) were observed in January (the beginning of the fruiting stage), while leaves collected in March (the full fruiting stage of plants) were marked by the most important accumulation of germacrene D (21.18%). All essential oils were found to possess antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and a-amylase inhibitory activities. The level of activity varied according to the oil composition. Leaf essential oils collected at the full flowering stage exhibited the important radical scavenging capacity (22.3 mg Eq trolox/g EO) and the uppermost inhibitory activities against AChE (2.91 mg Eq donepezil/g EO) and a-amylase (14.4 mg Eq acarbose/g EO). Flower buds essential oils were the most efficient inhibitors of AChE (1.86 mg Eq donepezil/g EO), while essential oils of leaves and fruits possess the highest activity against a-amylase (8.32 and 8.84 mg Eq acarbose/g EO, respectively)."
Biosynthesis of essential oils in aromatic plants: A review,"In aromatic plants species, biosynthesis of essential oils occurs through two complex natural biochemical pathways involving different enzymatic reactions. Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) are the universal precursors of essential oil biosynthesis and are produced by the cytosolic enzymatic MVA (mevalonic acid) pathway or by plastidic and enzymatic 1-deoxy-d-xylolose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway, also called the 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. In the particular plant cell part, prenyl diphosphate synthases condense isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) further to form prenyl diphosphates, which are used as substrates for geranyl diphosphate (GPP; C10) or for fernesyl diphosphate (FPP; C15). Essential oils are final terpenoid products and are formed by a huge group of enzymes known as terpene synthases (TPS). Essential oils are important secondary metabolites of plants and have been used not only in different industries but also in ethnobotanical medicines for centuries. Hence, considerable research has been undertaken to understand the essential oil biosynthetic pathways. This review will be a valuable source of information in the field of natural products, as we give detailed insights about biosynthesis of essential oils in plants and thus indicate also new unexplored horizons for further research."
Comparative Analysis of Volatile Terpenoids Composition in Rosemary Leaves in Response to Ionizing Radiation,"This study examined differential regulation of volatile terpenoids produced by rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) leaves in response to ionizing irradiation. Headspace volatile collection from rosemary leaves by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses revealed that rosemary leaves biologically synthesized 26 species of volatile terpenoids and their relative ratio were changed after the exposure to ?-irradiation. Relative ratio of oxygenated monoterpenes such as borneol, (-)-verbenone, lemonol, and bornyl acetate (except for 1,8-cineol, linalool, chrysanthenone, camphor, and (+)-verbenone) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (i.e., caryophyllene-type) increased when the rosemary leaves were exposed to ?-ray in a dose-dependent manner. On the contrary, the change of the ratio of oxygenated sesquiterpenes such as caryophyllene oxide was negligible, and that of monoterpene hydrocarbons like a-pinene, camphene, myrcene, and limonene was down-regulated. These results indicate that ?-irradiation can modify chemical structures of volatile terpenes, and can, thus, be applied to reconstitute chemical constituents in aromatic plants."
"Cytochrome P450s in plant terpenoid biosynthesis: discovery, characterization and metabolic engineering","As the largest family of natural products, terpenoids play valuable roles in medicine, agriculture, cosmetics and food. However, the traditional methods that rely on direct extraction from the original plants not only produce low yields, but also result in waste of resources, and are not applicable at all to endangered species. Modern heterologous biosynthesis is considered a promising, efficient, and sustainable production method, but it relies on the premise of a complete analysis of the biosynthetic pathway of terpenoids, especially the functionalization processes involving downstream cytochrome P450s. In this review, we systematically introduce the biotech approaches used to discover and characterize plant terpenoid-related P450s in recent years. In addition, we propose corresponding metabolic engineering approaches to increase the effective expression of P450 and improve the yield of terpenoids, and also elaborate on metabolic engineering strategies and examples of heterologous biosynthesis of terpenoids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and plant hosts. Finally, we provide perspectives for the biotech approaches to be developed for future research on terpenoid-related P450."
Diversity and Biosynthesis of Volatile Terpenoid Secondary Metabolites in the Chrysanthemum Genus,"Chrysanthemum is a significant genus belonging to one of the largest plant families, the Asteraceae. Among the over 40 recognized species, C. morifolium is best-known for its long history of cultivation and countless varieties. Like some other genera of this family, many Chrysanthemum species are producers of high levels of secondary metabolites. This review focuses on the largest class of plant secondary metabolites, namely terpenoids produced by Chrysanthemum species. An extensive literature search revealed a total of 390 terpenoids from these species, which include 183 monoterpenoids and 207 sesquiterpenoids. While some terpenes are produced by almost all of the investigated varieties/species of Chrysanthemum, many terpenoids show specificity to certain varieties or species, indicating species-specific functions. The enzymes and genes participating in the pathways for terpene biosynthesis are also described. In addition to a general overview, in this review we focus on isoprenyl diphosphate synthases and terpene synthases, two enzyme classes pivotal for generating the chemical diversity of terpenes, as established by our analysis of two sequenced genomes of Chrysanthemum. While our knowledge about the biological functions of terpenoids in Chrysanthemum is limited, we discuss their functions in chemical defenses against insects and microbial pathogens. Finally, we present the prospects of understanding the molecular basis of terpene biosynthesis in Chrysanthemum and elucidating its biological significance, as well as the prospects of translational research on terpene-based applications."
Metabolic engineering of sesquiterpene metabolism in yeast,"Terpenes are structurally diverse compounds that are of interest because of their biological activities and industrial value. These compounds consist of chirally rich hydrocarbon backbones derived from terpene synthases, which are subsequently decorated with hydroxyl substituents catalyzed by terpene hydroxylases. Availability of these compounds is, however, limited by intractable synthetic means and because they are produced in low amounts and as complex mixtures by natural sources. We engineered yeast for sesquiterpene accumulation by introducing genetic modifications that enable the yeast to accumulate high levels of the key intermediate farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Co-expression of terpene synthase genes diverted the enlarged FPP pool to greater than 80 mg/L of sesquiterpene. Efficient coupling of terpene production with hydroxylation was also demonstrated by coordinate expression of terpene hydroxylase activity, yielding 50 mg/L each of hydrocarbon and hydroxylated products. These yeast now provide a convenient format for investigating catalytic coupling between terpene synthases and hydroxylases, as well as a platform for the industrial production of high value, single-entity and stereochemically unique terpenes.

Metabolic engineering of volatile isoprenoids in plants and microbes,"The chemical properties and diversity of volatile isoprenoids lends them to a broad variety of biological roles. It also lends them to a host of biotechnological applications, both by taking advantage of their natural functions and by using them as industrial chemicals/chemical feedstocks. Natural functions include roles as insect attractants and repellents, abiotic stress protectants in pathogen defense, etc. Industrial applications include use as pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, fuels, fuel additives, etc. Here we will examine the ways in which researchers have so far found to exploit volatile isoprenoids using biotechnology. Production and/or modification of volatiles using metabolic engineering in both plants and microorganisms are reviewed, including engineering through both mevalonate and methylerythritol diphosphate pathways. Recent advances are illustrated using several case studies (herbivores and bodyguards, isoprene, and monoterpene production in microbes). Systems and synthetic biology tools with particular utility for metabolic engineering are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss the practical realities of various applications in modern biotechnology, explore possible future applications, and examine the challenges of moving these technologies forward so that they can deliver tangible benefits. While this review focuses on volatile isoprenoids, many of the engineering approaches described here are also applicable to non-isoprenoid volatiles and to non-volatile isoprenoids."
Modern Aspects of Isotopic Labellings in Terpene Biosynthesis,"In this review article recent isotopic labelling experiments are presented that served in the elucidation of the complex mechanisms of terpene biosynthesis. The article is structured by first presenting the recent advances in the biosynthesis of terpene monomers, followed by sections on monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. This overview covers a personal selection of eminent examples from the accumulated literature since 2010."

Moonlighting Metals: Insights into Regulation of Cyclization Pathways in Fungal ?6-Protoilludene Sesquiterpene Synthases,"Fungal 1,11 cyclizing sesquiterpene synthases are product specific under typical reaction conditions. However, in vivo expression of certain ?6-protoilludene synthases results in dual 1,11 and 1,10 cyclization. To determine the factors regulating this mechanistic variation, in-depth in vitro characterization of ?6-protoilludene synthases was conducted. Divalent metal ions determine cyclization specificity and this product variability. Promiscuity in metal binding is mediated by secondary metal-binding sites away from the conserved D(D/E)XX(D/E) motif in sesquiterpene synthases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a divergent evolution of Basidiomycota trans-humulyl cation producing sesquiterpene synthases, results that indicate a wider diversity in function than previously predicted. This study provides key insights into the function and evolution of 1,11 cyclizing fungal sesquiterpene synthases."
Natural products – modifying metabolite pathways in plants,"The diversity of plant natural product (PNP) molecular structures is reflected in the variety of biochemical and genetic pathways that lead to their formation and accumulation. Plant secondary metabolites are important commodities, and include fragrances, colorants, and medicines. Increasing the extractable amount of PNP through plant breeding, or more recently by means of metabolic engineering, is a priority. The prerequisite for any attempt at metabolic engineering is a detailed knowledge of the underlying biosynthetic and regulatory pathways in plants. Over the past few decades, an enormous body of information about the biochemistry and genetics of biosynthetic pathways involved in PNPs production has been generated. In this review, we focus on the three large classes of plant secondary metabolites: terpenoids (or isoprenoids), phenylpropanoids, and alkaloids. All three provide excellent examples of the tremendous efforts undertaken to boost our understanding of biosynthetic pathways, resulting in the first successes in plant metabolic engineering. We further consider what essential information is still missing, and how future research directions could help achieve the rational design of plants as chemical factories for high-value products."
Oak gall wasp infections of Quercus robur leaves lead to profound modifications in foliage photosynthetic and volatile emission characteristics,"Oak trees (Quercus) are hosts of diverse gall-inducing parasites, but the effects of gall formation on the physiology and biochemistry on host oak leaves is poorly understood. The influence of infection by four species from two widespread gall wasp genera, Neuroterus (N. anthracinus and N. albipes) and Cynips (C. divisa and C. quercusfolii), on foliage morphology, chemistry, photosynthetic characteristics, constitutive isoprene, and induced volatile emissions in Q. robur was investigated. Leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), net assimilation rate per area (AA), stomatal conductance (gs), and constitutive isoprene emissions decreased with the severity of infection by all gall wasp species. The reduction in AA was mainly determined by reduced MA and to a lower extent by lower content of leaf nitrogen and phosphorus in gall-infected leaves. The emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles increased strongly with increasing infection severity for all 4 species with the strongest emissions in major vein associated species, N. anthracinus. Monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions were strongly elicited in N. albipes and Cynips species, but not in N. anthracinus. These results provide valuable information for diagnosing oak infections using ambient air volatile fingerprints and for predicting the impacts of infections on photosynthetic productivity and whole tree performance."
Plant Terpenoids: Biosynthesis and Ecological Functions,"Among plant secondary metabolites terpenoids are a structurally most diverse group; they function as phytoalex-ins in plant direct defense, or as signals in indirect defense responses which involves herbivores and their natural enemies. In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the investigation of the ecological role of plant terpenoids. The biosynthesis pathways of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes include the synthesis of C5 precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the synthesis of the immediate diphosphate precursors, and the formation of the diverse terpenoids. Terpene synthases (TPSs) play a key role in volatile terpene synthesis. By expression of the TPS genes, significant achievements have been made on metabolic engineering to increase terpenoid production. This review mainly summarizes the recent research progress in elucidating the ecological role of terpenoids and characterization of the enzymes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis. Spatial and temporal regulations of terpenoids metabolism are also discussed."
Plant volatile-mediated signalling and its application in agriculture: successes and challenges,"The mediation of volatile secondary metabolites in signalling between plants and other organisms has long been seen as presenting opportunities for sustainable crop protection. Initially, exploitation of interactions between plants and other organisms, particularly insect pests, foundered because of difficulties in delivering, sustainably, the signal systems for crop protection. We now have mounting and, in some cases, clear practical evidence for successful delivery by companion cropping or next-generation genetic modification (GM). At the same time, the type of plant signalling being exploited has expanded to signalling from plants to organisms antagonistic to pests, and to plant stress-induced, or primed, plant-to-plant signalling for defence and growth stimulation."
Plant volatiles in extreme terrestrial and marine environments,"This review summarizes the current understanding on plant and algal volatile organic compound (VOC) production and emission in extreme environments, where temperature, water availability, salinity or other environmental factors pose stress on vegetation. Here, the extreme environments include terrestrial systems, such as arctic tundra, deserts, CO2 springs and wetlands, and marine systems such as sea ice, tidal rock pools and hypersaline environments, with mangroves and salt marshes at the land–sea interface. The emission potentials at fixed temperature and light level or actual emission rates for phototrophs in extreme environments are frequently higher than for organisms from less stressful environments. For example, plants from the arctic tundra appear to have higher emission potentials for isoprenoids than temperate species, and hypersaline marine habitats contribute to global dimethyl sulphide (DMS) emissions in significant amounts. DMS emissions are more widespread than previously considered, for example, in salt marshes and some desert plants. The reason for widespread VOC, especially isoprenoid, emissions from different extreme environments deserves further attention, as these compounds may have important roles in stress resistance and adaptation to extremes. Climate warming is likely to significantly increase VOC emissions from extreme environments both by direct effects on VOC production and volatility, and indirectly by altering the composition of the vegetation."
Practical approaches to plant volatile analysis,"Plants emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that play important roles in their interaction with the environment and have a major impact on atmospheric chemistry. The development of static and dynamic techniques for headspace collection of volatiles in combination with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis has significantly improved our understanding of the biosynthesis and ecology of plant VOCs. Advances in automated analysis of VOCs have allowed the monitoring of fast changes in VOC emissions and facilitated in vivo studies of VOC biosynthesis. This review presents an overview of methods for the analysis of plant VOCs, including their advantages and disadvantages, with a focus on the latest technical developments. It provides guidance on how to select appropriate instrumentation and protocols for biochemical, physiological and ecologically relevant applications. These include headspace analyses of plant VOCs emitted by the whole organism, organs or enzymes as well as advanced on-line analysis methods for simultaneous measurements of VOC emissions with other physiological parameters."
Production of Macrocyclic Sesqui- and Diterpenes in Heterologous Microbial Hosts: A Systems Approach to Harness Nature’s Molecular Diversity,"Macrocyclic sesqui- (C15) and diterpenes (C20) are a functionally diverse group of natural products with versatile bioactivities encompassing anticancer, antimicrobial and insecticidal agents. Structural complexity prevents economically efficient total synthesis of these higher terpenoids. Heterologous production in recombinant whole-cell biocatalysts is an emerging alternative. Conventional cell systems (i.e., Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) frequently suffer from low volumetric yields. However, recent combinations of metabolic, enzyme and process engineering in conjunction with systems biology allow significant improvements towards economically viable processes. This Review analyzes research trends in the dynamic fields of terpene-centered microbial cell systems and enzyme engineering. An outlook is given on emerging microbial hosts, which may simplify cellular engineering towards higher product titers."
Production of the Inaccessible Sesquiterpene (-)-5-Epieremophilene by Metabolically Engineered Escherichia coli,"(-)-5-Epieremophilene, an epimer of the versatile sesquiterpene (+)-valencene, is an inaccessible natural product catalyzed by three sesquiterpene synthases (SmSTPSs1-3) of the Chinese medicinal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, and its biological activity remains less explored. In this study, three metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains were constructed for (-)-5-epieremophilene production with yields of 42.4–76.0 mg/L in shake-flask culture. Introducing an additional copy of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) gene through fusion expression of SmSTPS1-FDPS or dividing the FDP synthetic pathway into two modules resulted in significantly improved production, and ultimately 250 mg of (-)-5-epieremophilene were achieved. Biological assay indicated that (-)-5-epieremophilene showed significant antifeedant activity against Helicoverpa armigera (EC50=1.25 µg/cm2), a common pest of S. miltiorrhiza, implying its potential defensive role in the plant. The results provided an ideal material supply for studying other potential biological activities of (-)-5-epieremophilene, and also a strategy for manipulating terpene production in engineered E. coli using synthetic biology."
Recent advances in allelopathy for weed control: from knowledge to applications,"Allelopathy is the biological phenomenon of chemical interactions between living organisms in the ecosystem, and must be taken into account in addressing pest and weed problems in future sustainable agriculture. Allelopathy is a multidisciplinary science, but in some cases, aspects of its chemistry are overlooked, despite the need for a deep knowledge of the chemical structural characteristics of allelochemicals to facilitate the design of new herbicides. This review is focused on the most important advances in allelopathy, paying particular attention to the design and development of phenolic compounds, terpenoids and alkaloids as herbicides. The isolation of allelochemicals is mainly addressed, but other aspects such as the analysis and activities of derivatives or analogs are also covered. Furthermore, the use of allelopathy in the fight against parasitic plants is included. The past 12 years have been a prolific period for publications on allelopathy. This critical review discusses future research areas in this field and the state of the art is analyzed from the chemist's perspective. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry"
Reduced levels of volatile emissions in jasmonate-deficient spr2tomato mutants favour oviposition by insect herbivores,"Tomato plants release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) following insect or mechanical damage. In this study, the constitutive and wound-induced emission levels of VOCs in suppressor of prosystemin-mediated responses2 (spr2) mutant plants, compromised in linolenic acid (LA) and jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis, and in 35S::prosystemin (35S::prosys) plants, having upregulated direct defence responses, were compared. The spr2 mutants produced constitutively lower levels of VOCs, which were nonetheless increased in response to (a)biotic damage, although at lower levels than wild-type (Wt) and 35S::prosys plants. No significant differences in VOC emissions were detected between the latter two genotypes, thereby suggesting that systemin does not regulate indirect defence responses, whereas differences in fatty acid composition in spr2 plants led to the predominant emission of saturated C6 volatiles in response to wounding. The expression of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS2), a key gene involved in VOC synthesis in the chloroplast, was only upregulated in Manduca sexta L.-damaged Wt and 35S::prosys plants. However, its expression was restored in spr2 plants by exogenous LA or JA, suggesting that abated VOC emissions in spr2 plants are correlated with lowered DXS2 expression. Bioassays with two different insects showed that adult females significantly preferred spr2 plants, indicating that lowered levels of VOCs in tomato influence plant selection by insects during oviposition."
Roles of plant volatiles in defence against microbial pathogens and microbial exploitation of volatiles,"Plants emit a large variety of volatile organic compounds during infection by pathogenic microbes, including terpenes, aromatics, nitrogen-containing compounds, and fatty acid derivatives, as well as the volatile plant hormones, methyl jasmonate, and methyl salicylate. Given the general antimicrobial activity of plant volatiles and the timing of emission following infection, these compounds have often been assumed to function in defence against pathogens without much solid evidence. In this review, we critically evaluate current knowledge on the toxicity of volatiles to fungi, bacteria, and viruses and their role in plant resistance as well as how they act to induce systemic resistance in uninfected parts of the plant and in neighbouring plants. We also discuss how microbes can detoxify plant volatiles and exploit them as nutrients, attractants for insect vectors, and inducers of volatile emissions, which stimulate immune responses that make plants more susceptible to infection. Although much more is known about plant volatile–herbivore interactions, knowledge of volatile–microbe interactions is growing and it may eventually be possible to harness plant volatiles to reduce disease in agriculture and forestry. Future research in this field can be facilitated by making use of the analytical and molecular tools generated by the prolific research on plant–herbivore interactions."
Significance of terpenoids in induced indirect plant defence against herbivorous arthropods,"Many plants respond to herbivory by arthropods with an induced emission of volatiles such as green leaf volatiles and terpenoids. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can attract carnivores, for example, predators and parasitoids. We investigated the significance of terpenoids in attracting herbivores and carnivores in two tritrophic systems where we manipulated the terpenoid emission by treating the plants with fosmidomycin, which inhibits one of the terpenoid biosynthetic pathways and consequently terpenoid emission."
"Squalene – biochemistry, molecular biology, process biotechnology, and applications","Squalene is a natural triterpene and an important intermediate of sterol and hopanoid biosynthesis in various types of cell from bacteria to human. Synthesis and further conversion of squalene are key steps in the metabolism of sterols and related components. Here we summarize the recent knowledge of squalene biochemistry, its molecular properties, and its physiological effects. We compare squalene biosynthetic pathways in different cell types and describe biotechnological strategies to isolate this lipid. Finally, applications of squalene in nutrition, pharmacy, and medicine are discussed."
Synthetic biology for production of natural and new-to-nature terpenoids in photosynthetic organisms,"With tens of thousands of characterized members, terpenoids constitute the largest class of natural compounds that are synthesized by all living organisms. Several terpenoids play primary roles in the maintenance of cell membrane fluidity, as pigments or as phytohormones, but most of them function as specialized metabolites that are involved in plant resistance to herbivores or plant–environment interactions. Terpenoids are an essential component of human nutrition, and many are economically important pharmaceuticals, aromatics and potential next-generation biofuels. Because of the often low abundance in their natural source, as well as the demand for novel terpenoid structures with new or improved bioactivities, terpenoid biosynthesis has become a prime target for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology projects. In this review we focus on the creation of new-to-nature or tailor-made plant-derived terpenoids in photosynthetic organisms, in particular by means of combinatorial biosynthesis and the activation of silent metabolism. We reflect on the characteristics of different potential photosynthetic host organisms and recent advances in synthetic biology and discuss their utility for the (heterologous) production of (novel) terpenoids."
Targeted proteomics using selected reaction monitoring reveals the induction of specific terpene synthases in a multi-level study of methyl jasmonate-treated Norway spruce (Picea abies ),"Induction of terpene synthase (TPS) gene expression and enzyme activity is known to occur in response to various chemical and biological stimuli in several species of spruce (genus Picea). However, high sequence identity between TPS family members has made it difficult to determine the induction patterns of individual TPS at the protein and transcript levels and whether specific TPS enzymes respond differentially to treatment. In the present study we used a multi-level approach to measure the induction and activity of TPS enzymes in protein extracts of Norway spruce (Picea abies) bark tissue following treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Measurements were made on the transcript, protein, enzyme activity and metabolite levels. Using a relatively new proteomics application, selective reaction monitoring (SRM), it was possible to differentiate and quantitatively measure the abundance of several known TPS proteins and three 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) isoforms in Norway spruce. Protein levels of individual TPS and DXS enzymes were differentially induced upon MeJA treatment and good correlation was generally observed between induction of transcripts, proteins, and enzyme activities. Most of the mono- and diterpenoid metabolites accumulated with similar temporal patterns of induction as part of the coordinated multi-compound chemical defense response. Protein and enzyme activity levels of the monoTPS (+)-3-carene synthase and the corresponding accumulation of (+)-3-carene was induced to a higher fold change than any other TPS or metabolite measured, indicating an important role in the induced terpenoid defense response in Norway spruce."
Temperature and light dependence of ß-caryophyllene emission rates,"[1] Assessments of the overall release of reactive volatile organic compounds from vegetation require the knowledge of the effect of temperature and light intensity on emission rates. The aim of the study presented here was to investigate whether the rates of emission of the highly reactive sesquiterpene ß-Caryophyllene (BCAR) from foliage of orange trees (Citrus sinensis (L.) OSBECK, var. Navel and Navel Late), detected using branch enclosures in an orange orchard in Spain, were not only temperature but also light dependent. We used two algorithms to calculate the diurnal variation of BCAR emission rates from environmental data. One algorithm accounted exclusively for the known exponential relationship between emission rate and temperature, and the other for both temperature and light effects. Assuming a light and temperature dependence of BCAR emission rates led to a more precise prediction of the short-term variation of BCAR emission rates than assuming that emissions are affected exclusively by temperature. The light dependence of BCAR emission rates could be due to a modulation of BCAR synthesis by light, or to an enhanced volatilization of BCAR from storage pools under high light exposure, or a combination of both. The data show that present assessments of the total release of reactive volatile organic compounds from vegetation, disregarding light effects on BCAR emission, are highly uncertain, if BCAR considerably contributes to total terpenoid emissions of the investigated plants."
Terpene glucoside production: Improved biocatalytic processes using glycosyltransferases,"Terpenoids are one of the main classes of natural products. In plants, a large fraction of the terpenoids is present as nonvolatile glycosides. The terpene glycosides have attracted much attention as antimicrobials, flavor precursors, and detergents. They are either extracted from plant materials or are synthesized by chemical and biocatalytic methods. Up to now, biotechnological production of terpene glycosides is based on reversed hydrolysis performed by glycosidases. However, this method suffers from low yields as a matter of principle. Recently, the first uridine diphosphate-glucose:monoterpenol ß-d-glucosyltransferase (GT) genes were cloned and characterized from grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa). Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli yielded promiscuous GT enzymes that efficiently glucosylated primary monoterpenols, simple alcohols, and phenols. The GT enzymes differed in substrate preference and activity toward their terpenoid substrates. Biotransformation experiments confirmed the applicability of the novel GTs in biocatalytic processes for the production of these novel compounds. In the near future, terpene glucosides will become commercially available for food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industry due to improved biocatalytic processes involving GT enzymes."
Terpenoid biomaterials,"Terpenoids (isoprenoids) encompass more than 40 000 structures and form the largest class of all known plant metabolites. Some terpenoids have well-characterized physiological functions that are common to most plant species. In addition, many of the structurally diverse plant terpenoids may function in taxonomically more discrete, specialized interactions with other organisms. Historically, specialized terpenoids, together with alkaloids and many of the phenolics, have been referred to as secondary metabolites. More recently, these compounds have become widely recognized, conceptually and/or empirically, for their essential ecological functions in plant biology. Owing to their diverse biological activities and their diverse physical and chemical properties, terpenoid plant chemicals have been exploited by humans as traditional biomaterials in the form of complex mixtures or in the form of more or less pure compounds since ancient times. Plant terpenoids are widely used as industrially relevant chemicals, including many pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, pesticides and disinfectants, and as large-volume feedstocks for chemical industries. Recently, there has been a renaissance of awareness of plant terpenoids as a valuable biological resource for societies that will have to become less reliant on petrochemicals. Harnessing the powers of plant and microbial systems for production of economically valuable plant terpenoids requires interdisciplinary and often expensive research into their chemistry, biosynthesis and genomics, as well as metabolic and biochemical engineering. This paper provides an overview of the formation of hemi-, mono-, sesqui- and diterpenoids in plants, and highlights some well-established examples for these classes of terpenoids in the context of biomaterials and biofuels."
Terpenoid Biosynthesis and Specialized Vascular Cells of Conifer Defense,"Defense-related terpenoid biosynthesis in conifers is a dynamic process closely associated with specialized anatomical structures that allows conifers to cope with attack from many potential pests and pathogens. The constitutive and inducible terpenoid defense of conifers involves several hundred different monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Changing arrays of these many compounds are formed from the general isoprenoid pathway by activities of large gene families for two classes of enzymes, the terpene synthases and the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases of the CYP720B group. Extensive studies have been conducted on the genomics, proteomics and molecular biochemical characterization of these enzymes. Many of the conifer terpene synthases are multi-product enzymes, and the P450 enzymes of the CYP720B group are promiscuous in catalyzing multiple oxidations, along homologous series of diterpenoids, from a broad spectrum of substrates. The terpene synthases and CYP720B genes respond to authentic or simulated insect attack with increased transcript levels, protein abundance and enzyme activity. The constitutive and induced oleoresin terpenoids for conifer defense accumulate in preformed cortical resin ducts and in xylem trauma-associated resin ducts. Formation of these resin ducts de novo in the cambium zone and developing xylem, following insect attack or treatment of trees with methyl jasmonate, is a unique feature of the induced defense of long-lived conifer trees."
The family of terpene synthases in plants: a mid-size family of genes for specialized metabolism that is highly diversified throughout the kingdom,"Some plant terpenes such as sterols and carotenes are part of primary metabolism and found essentially in all plants. However, the majority of the terpenes found in plants are classified as ‘secondary’ compounds, those chemicals whose synthesis has evolved in plants as a result of selection for increased fitness via better adaptation to the local ecological niche of each species. Thousands of such terpenes have been found in the plant kingdom, but each species is capable of synthesizing only a small fraction of this total. In plants, a family of terpene synthases (TPSs) is responsible for the synthesis of the various terpene molecules from two isomeric 5-carbon precursor ‘building blocks’, leading to 5-carbon isoprene, 10-carbon monoterpenes, 15-carbon sesquiterpenes and 20-carbon diterpenes. The bryophyte Physcomitrella patens has a single TPS gene, copalyl synthase/kaurene synthase (CPS/KS), encoding a bifunctional enzyme producing ent-kaurene, which is a precursor of gibberellins. The genome of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii contains 18 TPS genes, and the genomes of some model angiosperms and gymnosperms contain 40–152 TPS genes, not all of them functional and most of the functional ones having lost activity in either the CPS- or KS-type domains. TPS genes are generally divided into seven clades, with some plant lineages having a majority of their TPS genes in one or two clades, indicating lineage-specific expansion of specific types of genes. Evolutionary plasticity is evident in the TPS family, with closely related enzymes differing in their product profiles, subcellular localization, or the in planta substrates they use."

The role of volatiles in plant communication,"Volatiles mediate the interaction of plants with pollinators, herbivores and their natural enemies, other plants and micro-organisms. With increasing knowledge about these interactions the underlying mechanisms turn out to be increasingly complex. The mechanisms of biosynthesis and perception of volatiles are slowly being uncovered. The increasing scientific knowledge can be used to design and apply volatile-based agricultural strategies."
The scarecrow-like transcription factor SlSCL3 regulates volatile terpene biosynthesis and glandular trichome size in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum),"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) type VI glandular trichomes that occur on the surface of leaves, stems, young fruits and flowers produce and store a blend of volatile monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. These compounds play important roles in the interaction with pathogens and herbivorous insects. Although the function of terpene synthases in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenes in tomato has been comprehensively investigated, the deciphering of their transcriptional regulation is only just emerging. We selected transcription factors that are over-expressed in trichomes based on existing transcriptome data and silenced them individually by virus-induced gene silencing. Of these, SlSCL3, a scarecrow-like (SCL) subfamily transcription factor, led to a significant decrease in volatile terpene content and expression of the corresponding terpene synthase genes when its transcription level was downregulated. Overexpression of SlSCL3 dramatically increased both the volatile terpene content and glandular trichome size, whereas its homozygous mutants showed reduced terpene biosynthesis. However, its heterozygous mutants also showed a significantly elevated volatile terpene content and enlarged glandular trichomes, similar to the overexpression plants. SlSCL3 modulates the expression of terpene biosynthetic pathway genes by transcriptional activation, but neither direct protein–DNA binding nor interaction with known regulators was observed. Moreover, transcript levels of the endogenous copy of SlSCL3 were decreased in the overexpression plants but increased in the heterozygous and homozygous mutants, suggesting feedback repression of its own promoter. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the role of SlSCL3 in the complex regulation of volatile terpene biosynthesis and glandular trichome development in tomato."
Two independent biochemical pathways for isopentenyl diphosphate and isoprenoid biosynthesis in higher plants,"In the early times of isoprenoid research, a single pathway was found for the formation of the C5 monomer, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), and this acetate/mevalonate pathway was supposed to occur ubiquitously in all living organisms. Now, 40 years later, a totally different IPP biosynthesis route has been detected in eubacteria, green algae and higher plants. In this new pathway glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate are precursors of isopentenyl diphosphate, but not acetyl-CoA and mevalonic acid. In green tissues of three higher plants it was shown that all chloroplastbound isoprenoids (ß-carotene, phytyl chains of chlorophylls and nona-prenyl chain of plastoquinone-9) are formed via the GAP/pyruvate pathway, whereas the cytoplasmic sterols are formed via the acetate/mevalonate pathway. Also, isoprene, emitted by various plants at high light conditions by action of the plastid-bound isoprene synthase, is formed via the new GAP/pyruvate pathway. Thus, in higher plants, there exist two separate and biochemically different IPP biosynthesis pathways: (1) the novel alternative GAP/pyruvate pathway apparently bound to the plastidic compartment and (2) the classical cytoplasmic acetate/mevalonate pathway. This new GAP/pyruvate pathway for IPP formation allows a reasonable interpretation of previous odd results concerning the biosynthesis of chloroplast isoprenoids, which, so far, had mainly been interpreted assuming compartmentation differences. The novel GAP/pyruvate pathway for IPP formation in plastids appears as a heritage of their prokaryotic, endosymbiotic ancestors."
Up-regulation of an N-terminal truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase enhances production of essential oils and sterols in transgenic Lavandula latifolia,"Spike lavender (Lavandula latifolia) essential oil is widely used in the perfume, cosmetic, flavouring and pharmaceutical industries. Thus, modifications of yield and composition of this essential oil by genetic engineering should have important scientific and commercial applications. We generated transgenic spike lavender plants expressing the Arabidopsis thaliana HMG1 cDNA, encoding the catalytic domain of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR1S), a key enzyme of the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway. Transgenic T0 plants accumulated significantly more essential oil constituents as compared to controls (up to 2.1- and 1.8-fold in leaves and flowers, respectively). Enhanced expression of HMGR1S also increased the amount of the end-product sterols, ß-sitosterol and stigmasterol (average differences of 1.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively), but did not affect the accumulation of carotenoids or chlorophylls. We also analysed T1 plants derived from self-pollinated seeds of T0 lines that flowered after growing for 2 years in the greenhouse. The increased levels of essential oil and sterols observed in the transgenic T0 plants were maintained in the progeny that inherited the HMG1 transgene. Our results demonstrate that genetic manipulation of the MVA pathway increases essential oil yield in spike lavender, suggesting a contribution for this cytosolic pathway to monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in leaves and flowers of the species."
UV-B irradiation differentially regulates terpene synthases and terpene content of peach,"Plants generate protective molecules in response to ultraviolet (UV) light. In laboratory experiments, 48 h UV-B irradiation of peach fruits and leaves reduced the flavour-related monoterpene linalool by 60%. No isoprene was detected, but other terpenoids increased significantly, including a threefold accumulation of the sesquiterpene (E,E)-a-farnesene, which was also increased by jasmonic acid treatment. RNA sequencing revealed altered transcript levels for two terpene synthases (TPSs): PpTPS1, a TPS-g subfamily member, decreased by 86% and PpTPS2, a TPS-b subfamily member, increased 80-fold. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and transient overexpression in tobacco and peach fruits showed PpTPS1 was localized in plastids and associated with production of linalool, while PpTPS2 was responsible for (E,E)-a-farnesene biosynthesis in the cytoplasm. Candidate regulatory genes for these responses were identified. Commercial peach production in Asia involves fruit bagging to maintain marketable yield and quality. TPS gene expression and volatile terpenoid production in field experiments, using bags transmitting high UV-B radiation, showed similar effects on peach volatiles to those from laboratory experiments. Bags transmitting less UV-B light ameliorated the reduction in the flavour volatile linalool, indicating that flavour components of peach fruits can be modulated by selecting an appropriate source of environmental screening material."
Volatile terpenes – mediators of plant-to-plant communication,"Plants interact with other organisms employing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The largest group of plant-released VOCs are terpenes, comprised of isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. Mono- and sesquiterpenes are well-known communication compounds in plant–insect interactions, whereas the smallest, most commonly emitted terpene, isoprene, is rather assigned a function in combating abiotic stresses. Recently, it has become evident that different volatile terpenes also act as plant-to-plant signaling cues. Upon being perceived, specific volatile terpenes can sensitize distinct signaling pathways in receiver plant cells, which in turn trigger plant innate immune responses. This vastly extends the range of action of volatile terpenes, which not only protect plants from various biotic and abiotic stresses, but also convey information about environmental constraints within and between plants. As a result, plant–insect and plant–pathogen interactions, which are believed to influence each other through phytohormone crosstalk, are likely equally sensitive to reciprocal regulation via volatile terpene cues. Here, we review the current knowledge of terpenes as volatile semiochemicals and discuss why and how volatile terpenes make good signaling cues. We discuss how volatile terpenes may be perceived by plants, what are possible downstream signaling events in receiver plants, and how responses to different terpene cues might interact to orchestrate the net plant response to multiple stresses. Finally, we discuss how the signal can be further transmitted to the community level leading to a mutually beneficial community-scale response or distinct signaling with near kin."
Natural Variation in Monoterpene Synthesis in Kiwifruit: Transcriptional Regulation of Terpene Synthases by NAC and ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-Like Transcription Factors,"Two kiwifruit (Actinidia) species with contrasting terpene profiles were compared to understand the regulation of fruit monoterpene production. High rates of terpinolene production in ripe Actinidia arguta fruit were correlated with increasing gene and protein expression of A. arguta terpene synthase1 (AaTPS1) and correlated with an increase in transcript levels of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS). Actinidia chinensis terpene synthase1 (AcTPS1) was identified as part of an array of eight tandemly duplicated genes, and AcTPS1 expression and terpene production were observed only at low levels in developing fruit. Transient overexpression of DXS in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves elevated monoterpene synthesis by AaTPS1 more than 100-fold, indicating that DXS is likely to be the key step in regulating 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate substrate flux in kiwifruit. Comparative promoter analysis identified potential NAC (for no apical meristem [NAM], Arabidopsis transcription activation factor [ATAF], and cup-shaped cotyledon [CUC])-domain transcription factor) and ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-like transcription factor (TF) binding sites in the AaTPS1 promoter, and cloned members of both TF classes were able to activate the AaTPS1 promoter in transient assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that AaNAC2, AaNAC3, and AaNAC4 bind a 28-bp fragment of the proximal NAC binding site in the AaTPS1 promoter but not the A. chinensis AcTPS1 promoter, where the NAC binding site was mutated. Activation could be restored by reintroducing multiple repeats of the 12-bp NAC core-binding motif. The absence of NAC transcriptional activation in ripe A. chinensis fruit can account for the low accumulation of AcTPS1 transcript, protein, and monoterpene volatiles in this species. These results indicate the importance of NAC TFs in controlling monoterpene production and other traits in ripening fruits."
Oak powdery mildew (Erysiphe alphitoides)-induced volatile emissions scale with the degree of infection in Quercus robur,"Oak powdery mildew (Erysiphe alphitoides) is a major foliar pathogen of Quercus robur often infecting entire tree stands. In this study, foliage photosynthetic characteristics and constitutive and induced volatile emissions were studied in Q. robur leaves, in order to determine whether the changes in foliage physiological traits are quantitatively associated with the degree of leaf infection, and whether infection changes the light responses of physiological traits. Infection by E. alphitoides reduced net assimilation rate by 3.5-fold and isoprene emission rate by 2.4-fold, and increased stomatal conductance by 1.6-fold in leaves with the largest degree of infection of ~60%. These alterations in physiological activity were quantitatively associated with the fraction of leaf area infected. In addition, light saturation of net assimilation and isoprene emission was reached at lower light intensity in infected leaves, and infection also reduced the initial quantum yield of isoprene emission. Infection-induced emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles and monoterpenes were light-dependent and scaled positively with the degree of infection. Overall, this study indicates that the reduction of foliage photosynthetic activity and constitutive emissions and the onset of stress volatile emissions scale with the degree of infection, but also that the infection modifies the light responses of foliage physiological activities."
On the absence of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate/pyruvate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis in fungi and yeasts,"The biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, the central intermediate of isoprenoid formation, was investigated in the fungus Aschersonia aleyrodis and the yeast Rhodotorula glutinis. The incorporation of 13C-labeled glucose or acetate into their isoprenoids showed that ergosterol in both micro-organisms, ubiquinone in R. glutinis and dihydro-ubiquinone, ß-carotene and triterpenes of the hopane series in A. aleyrodis were synthesized via the mevalonate pathway. No evidence for the presence of the alternative mevalonate-independent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate/pyruvate pathway was found."
Overexpression of an Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthase in Spruce Leads to Unexpected Terpene Diversion Products That Function in Plant Defense    ,"Spruce (Picea spp.) and other conifers employ terpenoid-based oleoresin as part of their defense against herbivores and pathogens. The short-chain isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDS) are situated at critical branch points in terpene biosynthesis, producing the precursors of the different terpenoid classes. To determine the role of IDS and to create altered terpene phenotypes for assessing the defensive role of terpenoids, we overexpressed a bifunctional spruce IDS, a geranyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase in white spruce (Picea glauca) saplings. While transcript level (350-fold), enzyme activity level (7-fold), and in planta geranyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate levels (4- to 8-fold) were significantly increased in the needles of transgenic plants, there was no increase in the major monoterpenes and diterpene acids of the resin and no change in primary isoprenoids, such as sterols, chlorophylls, and carotenoids. Instead, large amounts of geranylgeranyl fatty acid esters, known from various gymnosperm and angiosperm plant species, accumulated in needles and were shown to act defensively in reducing the performance of larvae of the nun moth (Lymantria monacha), a conifer pest in Eurasia. These results show the impact of overexpression of an IDS and the defensive role of an unexpected accumulation product of terpenoid biosynthesis with the potential for a broader function in plant protection."
Plant Glandular Trichomes: Natural Cell Factories of High Biotechnological Interest,"Multicellular glandular trichomes are epidermal outgrowths characterized by the presence of a head made of cells that have the ability to secrete or store large quantities of specialized metabolites. Our understanding of the transcriptional control of glandular trichome initiation and development is still in its infancy. This review points to some central questions that need to be addressed to better understand how such specialized cell structures arise from the plant protodermis. A key and unique feature of glandular trichomes is their ability to synthesize and secrete large amounts, relative to their size, of a limited number of metabolites. As such, they qualify as true cell factories, making them interesting targets for metabolic engineering. In this review, recent advances regarding terpene metabolic engineering are highlighted, with a special focus on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). In particular, the choice of transcriptional promoters to drive transgene expression and the best ways to sink existing pools of terpene precursors are discussed. The bioavailability of existing pools of natural precursor molecules is a key parameter and is controlled by so-called cross talk between different biosynthetic pathways. As highlighted in this review, the exact nature and extent of such cross talk are only partially understood at present. In the future, awareness of, and detailed knowledge on, the biology of plant glandular trichome development and metabolism will generate new leads to tap the largely unexploited potential of glandular trichomes in plant resistance to pests and lead to the improved production of specialized metabolites with high industrial or pharmacological value."
Purification and structural analysis of volatile sesquiterpenes produced by Escherichia coli carrying unidentified terpene synthase genes from edible plants of the family Araliaceae,"A simple method to purify volatile sesquiterpenes from recombinant Escherichia coli was developed using the cells that carried known sesquiterpene synthase (Tps) genes ZzZss2 (ZSS2) and ZoTps1. This method was applied for the purification and structural analyses of volatile sesquiterpenes produced by E. coli cells that carried unidentified Tps genes, which were isolated from the Aralia-genus edible plants belonging to the family Araliaceae. Recombinant cells carrying each Tps gene were cultured in the two-layer medium (n-octane/TB medium), and volatile sesquiterpenes trapped in n-octane were purified through two-phase partition, silica gel column chromatography, and reversed-phase preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, if necessary. Further, their structures were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance, [a]D, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses. Herein, the products of E. coli cells that carried two Tps gene (named AcTps1 and AcTps2) in Araria cordata “Udo” and a Tps gene (named AeTps1) in Aralia elata “Taranoki” were studied resulting in identifying functionalities of these cryptic Tps genes."
"Regulation of Oleoresinosis in Grand Fir (Abies grandis)1: Differential Transcriptional Control of Monoterpene, Sesquiterpene, and Diterpene Synthase Genes in Response to Wounding","Grand fir (Abies grandis Lindl.) has been developed as a model system for the study of wound-induced oleoresinosis in conifers as a response to insect attack. Oleoresin is a roughly equal mixture of turpentine (85% monoterpenes [C10] and 15% sesquiterpenes [C15]) and rosin (diterpene [C20] resin acids) that acts to seal wounds and is toxic to both invading insects and their pathogenic fungal symbionts. The dynamic regulation of wound-induced oleoresin formation was studied over 29 d at the enzyme level by in vitro assay of the three classes of synthases directly responsible for the formation of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes from the corresponding C10, C15, and C20 prenyl diphosphate precursors, and at the gene level by RNA-blot hybridization using terpene synthase class-directed DNA probes. In overall appearance, the shapes of the time-course curves for all classes of synthase activities are similar, suggesting coordinate formation of all of the terpenoid types. However, closer inspection indicates that the monoterpene synthases arise earlier, as shown by an abbreviated time course over 6 to 48 h. RNA-blot analyses indicated that the genes for all three classes of enzymes are transcriptionally activated in response to wounding, with the monoterpene synthases up-regulated first (transcripts detectable 2 h after wounding), in agreement with the results of cell-free assays of monoterpene synthase activity, followed by the coordinately regulated sesquiterpene synthases and diterpene synthases (transcription beginning on d 3–4). The differential timing in the production of oleoresin components of this defense response is consistent with the immediate formation of monoterpenes to act as insect toxins and their later generation at solvent levels for the mobilization of resin acids responsible for wound sealing."
Relative Mass Defect Filtering of Mass Spectra: A Path to Discovery of Plant Specialized Metabolites  ,"The rapid identification of novel plant metabolites and assignments of newly discovered substances to natural product classes present the main bottlenecks to defining plant specialized phenotypes. Although mass spectrometry provides powerful support for metabolite discovery by measuring molecular masses, ambiguities in elemental formulas often fail to reveal the biosynthetic origins of specialized metabolites detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A promising approach for mining liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolite profiling data for specific metabolite classes is achieved by calculating relative mass defects (RMDs) from molecular and fragment ions. This strategy enabled the rapid recognition of an extensive range of terpenoid metabolites in complex plant tissue extracts and is independent of retention time, abundance, and elemental formula. Using RMD filtering and tandem mass spectrometry data analysis, 24 novel elemental formulas corresponding to glycosylated sesquiterpenoid metabolites were identified in extracts of the wild tomato Solanum habrochaites LA1777 trichomes. Extensive isomerism was revealed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, leading to evidence of more than 200 distinct sesquiterpenoid metabolites. RMD filtering led to the recognition of the presence of glycosides of two unusual sesquiterpenoid cores that bear limited similarity to known sesquiterpenes in the genus Solanum. In addition, RMD filtering is readily applied to existing metabolomics databases and correctly classified the annotated terpenoid metabolites in the public metabolome database for Catharanthus roseus."
Scaling of photosynthesis and constitutive and induced volatile emissions with severity of leaf infection by rust fungus (Melampsora larici-populina) in Populus balsamifera var. suaveolens,"Fungal infections result in decreases in photosynthesis, induction of stress and signaling volatile emissions and reductions in constitutive volatile emissions, but the way different physiological processes scale with the severity of infection is poorly known. We studied the effects of infection by the obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen Melampsora larici-populina Kleb., the causal agent of poplar leaf rust disease, on photosynthetic characteristics, and constitutive isoprene and induced volatile emissions in leaves of Populus balsamifera var. suaveolens (Fisch.) Loudon. exhibiting different degrees of damage. The degree of fungal damage, quantified by the total area of chlorotic and necrotic leaf areas, varied between 0 (noninfected control) and ~60%. The rates of all physiological processes scaled quantitatively with the degree of visual damage, but the scaling with damage severity was weaker for photosynthetic characteristics than for constitutive and induced volatile release. Over the whole range of damage severity, the net assimilation rate per area (AA) decreased 1.5-fold, dry mass per unit area 2.4-fold and constitutive isoprene emissions 5-fold, while stomatal conductance increased 1.9-fold and dark respiration rate 1.6-fold. The emissions of key stress and signaling volatiles (methanol, green leaf volatiles, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and methyl salicylate) were in most cases nondetectable in noninfested leaves, and increased strongly with increasing the spread of infection. The moderate reduction in AA resulted from the loss of photosynthetically active biomass, but the reduction in constitutive isoprene emissions and the increase in induced volatile emissions primarily reflected changes in the activities of corresponding biochemical pathways. Although all physiological alterations in fungal-infected leaves occurred in a stress severity-dependent manner, modifications in primary and secondary metabolic pathways scaled differently due to contrasting operational mechanisms."
SlMYC1 Regulates Type VI Glandular Trichome Formation and Terpene Biosynthesis in Tomato Glandular Cells,"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) glandular trichomes function as biochemical factories that synthesize a diverse array of specialized metabolites. Terpenoids are the most diverse class of plant specialized metabolites, with volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes playing important roles in plant defense. Although the biosynthetic pathways of volatile terpenes in tomato glandular trichomes have been well described, little is known about their regulation. Here, we demonstrate that SlMYC1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, differentially regulates mono- and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in the type VI glandular trichomes of tomato leaves and stems. SlMYC1 functions as a positive regulator of monoterpene biosynthesis in both leaf and stem trichomes but as a negative regulator of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in stem trichomes. SlMYC1 is also essential for type VI glandular trichome development, as knocking down SlMYC1 led to the production of smaller type VI glandular trichomes at lower densities, and knocking out this gene led to their absence. Our findings reveal a role for SlMYC1 not only in type VI glandular trichome development but also in the regulation of terpene biosynthesis in tomato."
Structure of a Heterotetrameric Geranyl Pyrophosphate Synthase from Mint (Mentha piperita) Reveals Intersubunit Regulation  ,"Terpenes (isoprenoids), derived from isoprenyl pyrophosphates, are versatile natural compounds that act as metabolism mediators, plant volatiles, and ecological communicators. Divergent evolution of homomeric prenyltransferases (PTSs) has allowed PTSs to optimize their active-site pockets to achieve catalytic fidelity and diversity. Little is known about heteromeric PTSs, particularly the mechanisms regulating formation of specific products. Here, we report the crystal structure of the (LSU · SSU)2-type (LSU/SSU = large/small subunit) heterotetrameric geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) from mint (Mentha piperita). The LSU and SSU of mint GPPS are responsible for catalysis and regulation, respectively, and this SSU lacks the essential catalytic amino acid residues found in LSU and other PTSs. Whereas no activity was detected for individually expressed LSU or SSU, the intact (LSU · SSU)2 tetramer produced not only C10-GPP at the beginning of the reaction but also C20-GGPP (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) at longer reaction times. The activity for synthesizing C10-GPP and C20-GGPP, but not C15-farnesyl pyrophosphate, reflects a conserved active-site structure of the LSU and the closely related mustard (Sinapis alba) homodimeric GGPPS. Furthermore, using a genetic complementation system, we showed that no C20-GGPP is produced by the mint GPPS in vivo. Presumably through protein–protein interactions, the SSU remodels the active-site cavity of LSU for synthesizing C10-GPP, the precursor of volatile C10-monoterpenes."
Terpene Biosynthesis in Red Algae Is Catalyzed by Microbial Type But Not Typical Plant Terpene Synthases,"Red algae (Rhodophyta) and land plants belong to the monophyletic clade Archaeplastida, and taxa of both groups are rich producers of terpene secondary metabolites. The terpene carbon skeletons of land plants are made by two types of terpene synthases: typical plant terpene synthases and microbial-type terpene synthases (MTPSLs); however, terpene biosynthesis in red algae is poorly understood. By systematic sequence analysis of seven genomes and 34 transcriptomes of red algae, MTPSL homologs were identified within one genome and two transcriptomes, whereas no homolog of typical plant terpene synthase genes was found. Phylogenetic analysis showed that red algae MTPSLs group with bacterial terpene synthases. Analysis of the genome assembly and characterization of neighboring genes demonstrated red algal MTPSLs to be bona fide red algal genes and not microbial contaminants. MTPSL genes from Porphyridium purpureum and Erythrolobus australicus were characterized via heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and demonstrated to have sesquiterpene synthase activities. We detected a number of volatile sesquiterpenes in the headspace of P. purpureum and E. australicus cultures, most identical to the in vitro products of the respective MTPSLs. Expression of the MTPSL gene in P. purpureum was found to be induced by methyl jasmonate, suggesting a role for this gene in host defense. In summary, this study indicates that the formation of terpene carbon skeletons in red algae is carried out by MTPSLs that are phylogenetically unrelated to typical plant terpene synthases and most likely originated in Rhodophyta via horizontal gene transfer from bacteria."
Terpene Down-Regulation Triggers Defense Responses in Transgenic Orange Leading to Resistance against Fungal Pathogens  ,"Terpenoid volatiles are isoprene compounds that are emitted by plants to communicate with the environment. In addition to their function in repelling herbivores and attracting carnivorous predators in green tissues, the presumed primary function of terpenoid volatiles released from mature fruits is the attraction of seed-dispersing animals. Mature oranges (Citrus sinensis) primarily accumulate terpenes in peel oil glands, with D-limonene accounting for approximately 97% of the total volatile terpenes. In a previous report, we showed that down-regulation of a D-limonene synthase gene alters monoterpene levels in orange antisense (AS) fruits, leading to resistance against Penicillium digitatum infection. A global gene expression analysis of AS versus empty vector (EV) transgenic fruits revealed that the down-regulation of D-limonene up-regulated genes involved in the innate immune response. Basal levels of jasmonic acid were substantially higher in the EV compared with AS oranges. Upon fungal challenge, salicylic acid levels were triggered in EV samples, while jasmonic acid metabolism and signaling were drastically increased in AS orange peels. In nature, D-limonene levels increase in orange fruit once the seeds are fully viable. The inverse correlation between the increase in D-limonene content and the decrease in the defense response suggests that D-limonene promotes infection by microorganisms that are likely involved in facilitating access to the pulp for seed-dispersing frugivores."
Terpenoids in plant and arbuscular mycorrhiza-reinforced defence against herbivorous insects,"Background Plants, though sessile, employ various strategies to defend themselves against herbivorous insects and convey signals of an impending herbivore attack to other plant(s). Strategies include the production of volatiles that include terpenoids and the formation of symbiotic associations with fungi, such as arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). This constitutes a two-pronged above-ground/below-ground attack–defence strategy against insect herbivores."
The Arabidopsis thaliana Type I Isopentenyl Diphosphate Isomerases Are Targeted to Multiple Subcellular Compartments and Have Overlapping Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis,"To form the building blocks of isoprenoids, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) isomerase activity, which converts IPP to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), appears to be necessary in cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria. Arabidopsis thaliana contains only two IPP isomerases (Isopentenyl Diphosphate Isomerase1 [IDI1] and IDI2). Both encode proteins with N-terminal extensions similar to transit peptides and are expressed in all organs, with IDI1 less abundant than IDI2. Examination of enhanced green fluorescent protein fusions established that IDI1 is mainly in the plastid, whereas IDI2 is mainly in the mitochondria. Both proteins are also in the cytosol as a result of their translation from naturally occurring shorter transcripts lacking transit peptides, as demonstrated by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends cloning. IPP isomerase activity in the cytosol was confirmed by uniform labeling of IPP- and DMAPP-derived units of the cytoplasmic isoprenoid product, sitosterol, when labeled mevalonate was administered. Analysis of mutant lines showed that double mutants were nonviable, while homozygous single mutants had no major morphological or chemical differences from the wild type except for flowers with fused sepals and underdeveloped petals on idi2 mutants. Thus, each of the two Arabidopsis IPP isomerases is found in multiple but partially overlapping subcellular locations, and each can compensate for the loss of the other through partial redundancy in the cytosol."
The Biochemical and Molecular Basis for the Divergent Patterns in the Biosynthesis of Terpenes and Phenylpropenes in the Peltate Glands of Three Cultivars of Basil,"Surface glandular trichomes distributed throughout the aerial parts of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) produce and store monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and phenylpropene volatiles. Three distinct basil chemotypes were used to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the divergence in their monoterpene and sesquiterpene content. The relative levels of specific terpenes in the glandular trichomes of each cultivar were correlated with the levels of transcripts for eight genes encoding distinct terpene synthases. In a cultivar that produces mostly (R)-linalool, transcripts of (R)-linalool synthase (LIS) were the most abundant of these eight. In a cultivar that synthesizes mostly geraniol, transcripts of geraniol synthase were the most abundant, but the glands of this cultivar also contained a transcript of an (R)-LIS gene with a 1-base insertion that caused a frameshift mutation. A geraniol synthase-LIS hybrid gene was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein catalyzed the formation of both geraniol and (R)-linalool from geranyl diphosphate. The total amounts of terpenes were correlated with total levels of terpene synthase activities, and negatively correlated with levels of phenylpropanoids and phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity. The relative levels of geranyl diphosphate synthase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase activities did not correlate with the total amount of terpenes produced, but showed some correlation with the ratio of monoterpenes to sesquiterpenes."
The Flavonoid Biosynthetic Enzyme Chalcone Isomerase Modulates Terpenoid Production in Glandular Trichomes of Tomato      ,"Flavonoids and terpenoids are derived from distinct metabolic pathways but nevertheless serve complementary roles in mediating plant interactions with the environment. Here, we show that glandular trichomes of the anthocyanin free (af) mutant of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fail to accumulate both flavonoids and terpenoids. This pleiotropic metabolic deficiency was associated with loss of resistance to native populations of coleopteran herbivores under field conditions. We demonstrate that Af encodes an isoform (SlCHI1) of the flavonoid biosynthetic enzyme chalcone isomerase (CHI), which catalyzes the conversion of naringenin chalcone to naringenin and is strictly required for flavonoid production in multiple tissues of tomato. Expression of the wild-type SlCHI1 gene from its native promoter complemented the anthocyanin deficiency in af. Unexpectedly, the SlCHI1 transgene also complemented the defect in terpenoid production in glandular trichomes. Our results establish a key role for SlCHI1 in flavonoid production in tomato and reveal a link between CHI1 and terpenoid production. Metabolic coordination of the flavonoid and terpenoid pathways may serve to optimize the function of trichome glands in dynamic environments."
The floral transcriptome of ylang ylang (Cananga odorata var. fruticosa) uncovers biosynthetic pathways for volatile organic compounds and a multifunctional and novel sesquiterpene synthase,"The pleasant fragrance of ylang ylang varieties (Cananga odorata) is mainly due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the flowers. Floral scents are a key factor in plant–insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to ß-thujene, sabinene, ß-pinene, and a-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate. The other two TPSs were identified as sesqui-TPSs. CoTPS3 catalysed the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to a-bergamotene, whereas CoTPS2 was found to be a multifunctional and novel TPS that could catalyse the synthesis of three sesquiterpenes, ß-ylangene, ß-copaene, and ß-cubebene. Additionally, the activities of the two sesqui-TPSs were confirmed in planta by transient expression of these TPS genes in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration."
"The Maize Gene terpene synthase 1 Encodes a Sesquiterpene Synthase Catalyzing the Formation of (E)-ß-Farnesene, (E)-Nerolidol, and (E,E)-Farnesol after Herbivore Damage","Maize (Zea mays) emits a mixture of volatile compounds upon attack by the Egyptian cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis). These substances, primarily mono- and sesquiterpenes, are used by parasitic wasps to locate the lepidopteran larvae, which are their natural hosts. This interaction among plant, lepidopteran larvae, and hymenopteran parasitoids benefits the plant and has been termed indirect defense. The committed step in the biosynthesis of the different skeletal types of mono- and sesquiterpenes is catalyzed by terpene synthases, a class of enzymes that forms a large variety of mono- and sesquiterpene products from prenyl diphosphate precursors. We isolated a terpene synthase gene,terpene synthase 1 (tps1), from maize that exhibits only a low degree of sequence identity to previously identified terpene synthases. Upon expression in a bacterial system, the encoded enzyme produced the acyclic sesquiterpenes, (E)-ß-farnesene, (E,E)-farnesol, and (3R)-(E)-nerolidol, the last an intermediate in the formation of (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. Both (E)-ß-farnesene and (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene are prominent compounds of the maize volatile blend that is emitted after herbivore damage. The biochemical characteristics of the encoded enzyme are similar to those of terpene synthases from both gymnosperms and dicotyledonous angiosperms, suggesting that catalysis involves a similar electrophilic reaction mechanism. The transcript level oftps1 in the maize cv B73 was elevated after herbivory, mechanical damage, and treatment with elicitors. In contrast, the increase in the transcript level of the tps1 gene or gene homolog in the maize cv Delprim after herbivory was less pronounced, suggesting that the regulation of terpene synthase expression may vary among maize varieties."
The molecular biology of fruity and floral aromas in beer and other alcoholic beverages,"Aroma compounds provide attractiveness and variety to alcoholic beverages. We discuss the molecular biology of a major subset of beer aroma volatiles, fruity and floral compounds, originating from raw materials (malt and hops), or formed by yeast during fermentation. We introduce aroma perception, describe the most aroma-active, fruity and floral compounds in fruits and their presence and origin in beer. They are classified into categories based on their functional groups and biosynthesis pathways: (1) higher alcohols and esters, (2) polyfunctional thiols, (3) lactones and furanones, and (4) terpenoids. Yeast and hops are the main sources of fruity and flowery aroma compounds in beer. For yeast, the focus is on higher alcohols and esters, and particularly the complex regulation of the alcohol acetyl transferase ATF1 gene. We discuss the release of polyfunctional thiols and monoterpenoids from cysteine- and glutathione-S-conjugated compounds and glucosides, respectively, the primary biological functions of the yeast enzymes involved, their mode of action and mechanisms of regulation that control aroma compound production. Furthermore, we discuss biochemistry and genetics of terpenoid production and formation of non-volatile precursors in Humulus lupulus (hops). Insight in these pathways provides a toolbox for creating innovative products with a diversity of pleasant aromas."
The Plastidial 2-C-Methyl-d-Erythritol 4-Phosphate Pathway Provides the Isoprenyl Moiety for Protein Geranylgeranylation in Tobacco BY-2 Cells  ,"Protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation are important posttranslational modifications in eukaryotic cells. We visualized in transformed Nicotiana tabacum Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells the geranylgeranylation and plasma membrane localization of GFP-BD-CVIL, which consists of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the C-terminal polybasic domain (BD) and CVIL isoprenylation motif from the Oryza sativa calmodulin, CaM61. Treatment with fosmidomycin (Fos) or oxoclomazone (OC), inhibitors of the plastidial 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, caused mislocalization of the protein to the nucleus, whereas treatment with mevinolin, an inhibitor of the cytosolic mevalonate pathway, did not. The nuclear localization of GFP-BD-CVIL in the presence of MEP pathway inhibitors was completely reversed by all-trans-geranylgeraniol (GGol). Furthermore, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose (DX) reversed the effects of OC, but not Fos, consistent with the hypothesis that OC blocks 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthesis, whereas Fos inhibits its conversion to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate. By contrast, GGol and DX did not rescue the nuclear mislocalization of GFP-BD-CVIL in the presence of a protein geranylgeranyltransferase type 1 inhibitor. Thus, the MEP pathway has an essential role in geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) biosynthesis and protein geranylgeranylation in BY-2 cells. GFP-BD-CVIL is a versatile tool for identifying pharmaceuticals and herbicides that interfere either with GGPP biosynthesis or with protein geranylgeranylation."
The Small Subunit of Snapdragon Geranyl Diphosphate Synthase Modifies the Chain Length Specificity of Tobacco Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Synthase in Planta,"Geranyl diphosphate (GPP), the precursor of many monoterpene end products, is synthesized in plastids by a condensation of dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) in a reaction catalyzed by homodimeric or heterodimeric GPP synthase (GPPS). In the heterodimeric enzymes, a noncatalytic small subunit (GPPS.SSU) determines the product specificity of the catalytic large subunit, which may be either an active geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) or an inactive GGPPS-like protein. Here, we show that expression of snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) GPPS.SSU in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants increased the total GPPS activity and monoterpene emission from leaves and flowers, indicating that the introduced catalytically inactive GPPS.SSU found endogenous large subunit partner(s) and formed an active snapdragon/tobacco GPPS in planta. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and in vitro enzyme analysis of individual and hybrid proteins revealed that two of four GGPPS-like candidates from tobacco EST databases encode bona fide GGPPS that can interact with snapdragon GPPS.SSU and form a functional GPPS enzyme in plastids. The formation of chimeric GPPS in transgenic plants also resulted in leaf chlorosis, increased light sensitivity, and dwarfism due to decreased levels of chlorophylls, carotenoids, and gibberellins. In addition, these transgenic plants had reduced levels of sesquiterpene emission, suggesting that the export of isoprenoid intermediates from the plastids into the cytosol was decreased. These results provide genetic evidence that GPPS.SSU modifies the chain length specificity of phylogenetically distant GGPPS and can modulate IPP flux distribution between GPP and GGPP synthesis in planta."
The Tomato Terpene Synthase Gene Family    ,"Compounds of the terpenoid class play numerous roles in the interactions of plants with their environment, such as attracting pollinators and defending the plant against pests. We show here that the genome of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) contains 44 terpene synthase (TPS) genes, including 29 that are functional or potentially functional. Of these 29 TPS genes, 26 were expressed in at least some organs or tissues of the plant. The enzymatic functions of eight of the TPS proteins were previously reported, and here we report the specific in vitro catalytic activity of 10 additional tomato terpene synthases. Many of the tomato TPS genes are found in clusters, notably on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10. All TPS family clades previously identified in angiosperms are also present in tomato. The largest clade of functional TPS genes found in tomato, with 12 members, is the TPS-a clade, and it appears to encode only sesquiterpene synthases, one of which is localized to the mitochondria, while the rest are likely cytosolic. A few additional sesquiterpene synthases are encoded by TPS-b clade genes. Some of the tomato sesquiterpene synthases use z,z-farnesyl diphosphate in vitro as well, or more efficiently than, the e,e-farnesyl diphosphate substrate. Genes encoding monoterpene synthases are also prevalent, and they fall into three clades: TPS-b, TPS-g, and TPS-e/f. With the exception of two enzymes involved in the synthesis of ent-kaurene, the precursor of gibberellins, no other tomato TPS genes could be demonstrated to encode diterpene synthases so far."
The Variability of Sesquiterpenes Emitted from Two Zea mays Cultivars Is Controlled by Allelic Variation of Two Terpene Synthase Genes Encoding Stereoselective Multiple Product Enzymes,"The mature leaves and husks of Zea mays release a complex blend of terpene volatiles after anthesis consisting predominantly of bisabolane-, sesquithujane-, and bergamotane-type sesquiterpenes. The varieties B73 and Delprim release the same volatile constituents but in significantly different proportions. To study the molecular genetic and biochemical mechanisms controlling terpene diversity and distribution in these varieties, we isolated the closely related terpene synthase genes terpene synthase4 (tps4) and tps5 from both varieties. The encoded enzymes, TPS4 and TPS5, each formed the same complex mixture of sesquiterpenes from the precursor farnesyl diphosphate but with different proportions of products. These mixtures correspond to the sesquiterpene blends observed in the varieties B73 and Delprim, respectively. The differences in the stereoselectivity of TPS4 and TPS5 are determined by four amino acid substitutions with the most important being a Gly instead of an Ala residue at position 409 at the catalytic site of the enzyme. Although both varieties contain tps4 and tps5 alleles, their differences in terpene composition result from the fact that B73 has only a single functional allele of tps4 and no functional alleles of tps5, whereas Delprim has only a functional allele of tps5 and no functional alleles of tps4. Lack of functionality was shown to be attributable to frame-shift mutations or amino acid substitutions that greatly reduce the activity of their encoded proteins. Therefore, the diversity of sesquiterpenes in these two maize cultivars is strongly influenced by single nucleotide changes in the alleles of two terpene synthase genes."
Two terpene synthases are responsible for the major sesquiterpenes emitted from the flowers of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa),"Kiwifruit vines rely on bees for pollen transfer between spatially separated male and female individuals and require synchronized flowering to ensure pollination. Volatile terpene compounds, which are important cues for insect pollinator attraction, were studied by dynamic headspace sampling in the major green-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) cultivar ‘Hayward’ and its male pollinator ‘Chieftain’. Terpene volatile levels showed a profile dominated by the sesquiterpenes a-farnesene and germacrene D. These two compounds were emitted by all floral tissues and could be observed throughout the day, with lower levels at night. The monoterpene (E)-ß-ocimene was also detected in flowers but was emitted predominantly during the day and only from petal tissue. Using a functional genomics approach, two terpene synthase (TPS) genes were isolated from a ‘Hayward’ petal EST library. Bacterial expression and transient in planta data combined with analysis by enantioselective gas chromatography revealed that one TPS produced primarily (E,E)-a-farnesene and small amounts of (E)-ß-ocimene, whereas the second TPS produced primarily (+)-germacrene D. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions showed that both enzymes were localized in the cytoplasm, the site for sesquiterpene production. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that both TPS genes were expressed in the same tissues and at the same times as the corresponding floral volatiles. The results indicate that two genes can account for the major floral sesquiterpene volatiles observed in both male and female A. deliciosa flowers."
"Variation of Herbivore-Induced Volatile Terpenes among Arabidopsis Ecotypes Depends on Allelic Differences and Subcellular Targeting of Two Terpene Synthases, TPS02 and TPS03    ","When attacked by insects, plants release mixtures of volatile compounds that are beneficial for direct or indirect defense. Natural variation of volatile emissions frequently occurs between and within plant species, but knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms is limited. We investigated intraspecific differences of volatile emissions induced from rosette leaves of 27 accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) upon treatment with coronalon, a jasmonate mimic eliciting responses similar to those caused by insect feeding. Quantitative variation was found for the emission of the monoterpene (E)-ß-ocimene, the sesquiterpene (E,E)-a-farnesene, the irregular homoterpene 4,8,12-trimethyltridecatetra-1,3,7,11-ene, and the benzenoid compound methyl salicylate. Differences in the relative emissions of (E)-ß-ocimene and (E,E)-a-farnesene from accession Wassilewskija (Ws), a high-(E)-ß-ocimene emitter, and accession Columbia (Col-0), a trace-(E)-ß-ocimene emitter, were attributed to allelic variation of two closely related, tandem-duplicated terpene synthase genes, TPS02 and TPS03. The Ws genome contains a functional allele of TPS02 but not of TPS03, while the opposite is the case for Col-0. Recombinant proteins of the functional Ws TPS02 and Col-0 TPS03 genes both showed (E)-ß-ocimene and (E,E)-a-farnesene synthase activities. However, differential subcellular compartmentalization of the two enzymes in plastids and the cytosol was found to be responsible for the ecotype-specific differences in (E)-ß-ocimene/(E,E)-a-farnesene emission. Expression of the functional TPS02 and TPS03 alleles is induced in leaves by elicitor and insect treatment and occurs constitutively in floral tissues. Our studies show that both pseudogenization in the TPS family and subcellular segregation of functional TPS enzymes control the variation and plasticity of induced volatile emissions in wild plant species."
2-Hydroxysorangiadenosine: Structure and Biosynthesis of a Myxobacterial Sesquiterpene–Nucleoside,"
Myxobacteria represent an under-investigated source for biologically active natural products featuring intriguing structural moieties with potential applications, e.g., in the pharmaceutical industry. Sorangiadenosine and the here-discovered 2-hydroxysorangiadenosine are myxobacterial sesquiterpene–nucleosides with an unusual structural moiety, a bicyclic eudesmane-type sesquiterpene. As the biosynthesis of these rare terpene–nucleoside hybrid natural products remains elusive, we investigated secondary metabolomes and genomes of several 2-hydroxysorangiadenosine-producing myxobacteria. We report the isolation and full structure elucidation of 2-hydroxysorangiadenosine and its cytotoxic and antibiotic activities and propose a biosynthetic pathway in the myxobacterium Vitiosangium cumulatum MCy10943T.

A Sesquiterpene Synthase from the Endophytic Fungus Serendipita indica Catalyzes Formation of Viridiflorol,"
Interactions between plant-associated fungi and their hosts are characterized by a continuous crosstalk of chemical molecules. Specialized metabolites are often produced during these associations and play important roles in the symbiosis between the plant and the fungus, as well as in the establishment of additional interactions between the symbionts and other organisms present in the niche. Serendipita indica, a root endophytic fungus from the phylum Basidiomycota, is able to colonize a wide range of plant species, conferring many benefits to its hosts. The genome of S. indica possesses only few genes predicted to be involved in specialized metabolite biosynthesis, including a putative terpenoid synthase gene (SiTPS). In our experimental setup, SiTPS expression was upregulated when the fungus colonized tomato roots compared to its expression in fungal biomass growing on synthetic medium. Heterologous expression of SiTPS in Escherichia coli showed that the produced protein catalyzes the synthesis of a few sesquiterpenoids, with the alcohol viridiflorol being the main product. To investigate the role of SiTPS in the plant-endophyte interaction, an SiTPS-over-expressing mutant line was created and assessed for its ability to colonize tomato roots. Although overexpression of SiTPS did not lead to improved fungal colonization ability, an in vitro growth-inhibition assay showed that viridiflorol has antifungal properties. Addition of viridiflorol to the culture medium inhibited the germination of spores from a phytopathogenic fungus, indicating that SiTPS and its products could provide S. indica with a competitive advantage over other plant-associated fungi during root colonization.

Advances in Fruit Aroma Volatile Research,"
Fruits produce a range of volatile compounds that make up their characteristic aromas and contribute to their flavor. Fruit volatile compounds are mainly comprised of esters, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, terpenoids and apocarotenoids. Many factors affect volatile composition, including the genetic makeup, degree of maturity, environmental conditions, postharvest handling and storage. There are several pathways involved in volatile biosynthesis starting from lipids, amino acids, terpenoids and carotenoids. Once the basic skeletons are produced via these pathways, the diversity of volatiles is achieved via additional modification reactions such as acylation, methylation, oxidation/reduction and cyclic ring closure. In this paper, we review the composition of fruit aroma, the characteristic aroma compounds of several representative fruits, the factors affecting aroma volatile, and the biosynthetic pathways of volatile aroma compounds. We anticipate that this review would provide some critical information for profound research on fruit aroma components and their manipulation during development and storage.

Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation of Chrysanthemum with Artemisinin Biosynthesis Pathway Genes,"
Artemisinin-based drugs are the most effective medicine for the malaria treatment. To date, the main method of artemisinin production is its extraction from wormwood plants Artemisia annua L. Due to the limitation of this source, considerable efforts are now directed to the development of methods for artemisinin production using heterologous expression systems. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone, synthesized through the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate involved in other sesquiterpene biosynthetic systems. Chrysanthemum species as well as A. annua, belong to Asteraceae family, and had been characterized by containing highly content of sesquiterpenes and their precursors. This makes chrysanthemum a promising target for the production of artemisinin in heterologous host plants. Chrysanthemum (C. morifolium Ramat.) was transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying with the binary vectors p1240 and p1250, bearing artemisinin biosynthesis genes coding: amorpha-4,11-diene synthase, artemisinic aldehyde ?11(13) reductase, amorpha-4,11-diene monooxygenase (p1240 was targeted to the mitochondria and p1250 was targeted to the cytosol), cytochrome P450 reductase from A. annua, as well as yeast truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase. This study obtained 8 kanamycin-resistant lines after transformation with the p1240 and 2 lines from p1250. All target genes were detected in 2 and 1 transgenic lines of the 2 vectors. The transformation frequency of all target genes were 0.33% and 0.17% for p1240 and p1250, relative to the total transformed explant numbers. RT-PCR analysis revealed the transcription of all transferred genes in two lines obtained after transformation with the p1240 vector, confirming the possibility of transferring genetic modules encoding entire biochemical pathways into the chrysanthemum genome. This holds promise for the development of a chrysanthemum-based expression system to produce non-protein substances, such as artemisinin.

"An Integrative Volatile Terpenoid Profiling and Transcriptomics Analysis in Hoya cagayanensis, Hoya lacunosa and Hoya coriacea (Apocynaceae, Marsdenieae)","
Hoya’s R.Br. attractive flower shapes and unique scents make it suitable to be exploited as a new source of tropical fragrance. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites using phytochemical and transcriptomic approaches to understand the mechanisms of scents biosynthesis, especially terpenoid in Hoya. Three Hoya flower species were selected in this study: Hoya cagayanensis, Hoya lacunosa, and Hoya coriacea. The secondary metabolite profiles characterizing scents on flowers were performed using head space solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed 23 compounds from H. cagayanensis, 14 from H. lacunose, and 36 from H. coriacea. Volatiles from the three species had different fragrance profiles, with ß-ocimene and methyl salicylate compounds dominating the odor in H. cagayanensis. The 1-octane-3-ol was found highest in H. lacunosa, and (Z)-acid butyric, 3-hexenyl ester was found highest in H. coriacea. Subsequent studies were conducted to identify the biosynthesis pathway of secondary metabolites responsible for the aroma profile released by Hoya flowers through transcriptome sequencing using the Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform. A total of 109,240 (75.84%) unigenes in H. cagayanensis, 42,479 (69.00%) in H. lacunosa and 72,610 (70.55%) in H. coriacea of the total unigenes were successfully annotated using public databases such as NCBI-Nr, KEGG, InterPro, and Gene Ontology (GO). In conclusion, this study successfully identified the complete outline of terpenoid biosynthesis pathways for the first time in Hoya. This discovery could lead to the exploitation of new knowledge in producing high-value compounds using the synthetic biology approach.

"An Update on the Function, Biosynthesis and Regulation of Floral Volatile Terpenoids","
Floral volatile terpenoids (FVTs) belong to a group of volatile organic compounds (VOC) that play important roles in attracting pollinators, defending against pathogens and parasites and serving as signals associated with biotic and abiotic stress responses. Although research on FVTs has been increasing, a systematic generalization is lacking. Among flowering plants used mainly for ornamental purposes, a systematic study on the production of FVTs in flowers with characteristic aromas is still limited. This paper reviews the biological functions and biosynthesis of FVTs, which may contribute a foundational aspect for future research. We highlight regulatory mechanisms that control the production of FVTs in ornamental flowers and the intersection of biosynthetic pathways that produce flower fragrance and color. Additionally, we summarize the opportunities and challenges facing FVT research in the whole genome and -omics eras and the possible research directions that will provide a foundation for further innovation and utilization of flowering ornamental plants and their germplasm resources.

Biochemical Characterization and Function of Eight Microbial Type Terpene Synthases from Lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii,"
Selaginella moellendorffii is a lycophyte, a member of an ancient vascular plant lineage. Two distinct types of terpene synthase (TPS) genes were identified from this species, including S. moellendorffii TPS genes (SmTPSs) and S. moellendorffii microbial TPS-like genes (SmMTPSLs). The goal of this study was to investigate the biochemical functions of SmMTPSLs. Here, eight full-length SmMTPSL genes (SmMTPSL5, -15, -19, -23, -33, -37, -46, and -47) were functionally characterized from S. moellendorffii. Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant SmMTPSLs were tested for monoterpenes synthase and sesquiterpenes synthase activities. These enzymatic products were typical monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that have been previous shown to be generated by typical plant TPSs when provided with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrates. Meanwhile, SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 were up-regulated when induced by alamethicin (ALA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), suggesting a role for these genes in plants response to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, this study pointed out that the terpenoids products of SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 have an antibacterial effect on Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and Staphylococcus aureus. Taken together, these results provide more information about the catalytic and biochemical function of SmMTPSLs in S. moellendorffii plants.

Terpenoid Metabolic Engineering in Photosynthetic Microorganisms,"
Terpenoids are a group of natural products that have a variety of roles, both essential and non-essential, in metabolism and in biotic and abiotic interactions, as well as commercial applications such as pharmaceuticals, food additives, and chemical feedstocks. Economic viability for commercial applications is commonly not achievable by using natural source organisms or chemical synthesis. Engineered bio-production in suitable heterologous hosts is often required to achieve commercial viability. However, our poor understanding of regulatory mechanisms and other biochemical processes makes obtaining efficient conversion yields from feedstocks challenging. Moreover, production from carbon dioxide via photosynthesis would significantly increase the environmental and potentially the economic credentials of these processes by disintermediating biomass feedstocks. In this paper, we briefly review terpenoid metabolism, outline some recent advances in terpenoid metabolic engineering, and discuss why photosynthetic unicellular organisms—such as algae and cyanobacteria—might be preferred production platforms for the expression of some of the more challenging terpenoid pathways

Terpenoids and Their Biosynthesis in Cyanobacteria,"
Terpenoids, or isoprenoids, are a family of compounds with great structural diversity which are essential for all living organisms. In cyanobacteria, they are synthesized from the methylerythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway, using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate produced by photosynthesis as substrates. The products of the MEP pathway are the isomeric five-carbon compounds isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, which in turn form the basic building blocks for formation of all terpenoids. Many terpenoid compounds have useful properties and are of interest in the fields of pharmaceuticals and nutrition, and even potentially as future biofuels. The MEP pathway, its function and regulation, and the subsequent formation of terpenoids have not been fully elucidated in cyanobacteria, despite its relevance for biotechnological applications. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge about cyanobacterial terpenoid biosynthesis, both regarding the native metabolism and regarding metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria for heterologous production of non-native terpenoids.

The Biosynthesis of Artemisinin (Qinghaosu) and the Phytochemistry of Artemisia annua L. (Qinghao),"
The Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia annua L. (Qinghao) is the only known source of the sesquiterpene artemisinin (Qinghaosu), which is used in the treatment of malaria. Artemisinin is a highly oxygenated sesquiterpene, containing a unique 1,2,4-trioxane ring structure, which is responsible for the antimalarial activity of this natural product. The phytochemistry of A. annua is dominated by both sesquiterpenoids and flavonoids, as is the case for many other plants in the Asteraceae family. However, A. annua is distinguished from the other members of the family both by the very large number of natural products which have been characterised to date (almost six hundred in total, including around fifty amorphane and cadinane sesquiterpenes), and by the highly oxygenated nature of many of the terpenoidal secondary metabolites. In addition, this species also contains an unusually large number of terpene allylic hydroperoxides and endoperoxides. This observation forms the basis of a proposal that the biogenesis of many of the highly oxygenated terpene metabolites from A. annua – including artemisinin itself – may proceed by spontaneous oxidation reactions of terpene precursors, which involve these highly reactive allyllic hydroperoxides as intermediates. Although several studies of the biosynthesis of artemisinin have been reported in the literature from the 1980s and early 1990s, the collective results from these studies were rather confusing because they implied that an unfeasibly large number of different sesquiterpenes could all function as direct precursors to artemisinin (and some of the experiments also appeared to contradict one another). As a result, the complete biosynthetic pathway to artemisinin could not be stated conclusively at the time. Fortunately, studies which have been published in the last decade are now providing a clearer picture of the biosynthetic pathways in A. annua. By synthesising some of the sesquiterpene natural products which have been proposed as biogenetic precursors to artemisinin in such a way that they incorporate a stable isotopic label, and then feeding these precursors to intact A. annua plants, it has now been possible to demonstrate that dihydroartemisinic acid is a late-stage precursor to artemisinin and that the closely related secondary metabolite, artemisinic acid, is not (this approach differs from all the previous studies, which used radio-isotopically labelled precursors that were fed to a plant homogenate or a cell-free preparation). Quite remarkably, feeding experiments with labeled dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinic acid have resulted in incorporation of label into roughly half of all the amorphane and cadinane sesquiterpenes which were already known from phytochemical studies of A. annua. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that many of the highly oxygenated sesquiterpenoids from this species arise by oxidation reactions involving allylic hydroperoxides, which seem to be such a defining feature of the chemistry of A. annua. In the particular case of artemisinin, these in vivo results are also supported by in vitro studies, demonstrating explicitly that the biosynthesis of artemisinin proceeds via the tertiary allylic hydroperoxide, which is derived from oxidation of dihydroartemisinic acid. There is some evidence that the autoxidation of dihydroartemisinic acid to this tertiary allylic hydroperoxide is a non-enzymatic process within the plant, requiring only the presence of light; and, furthermore, that the series of spontaneous rearrangement reactions which then convert this allylic hydroperoxide to the 1,2,4-trioxane ring of artemisinin are also non-enzymatic in nature.

The Complexity of Sesquiterpene Chemistry Dictates Its Pleiotropic Biologic Effects on Inflammation,"
Sesquiterpenes (SQs) are volatile compounds made by plants, insects, and marine organisms. SQ have a large range of biological properties and are potent inhibitors and modulators of inflammation, targeting specific components of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-?B) signaling pathway and nitric oxide (NO) generation. Because SQs can be isolated from over 1600 genera and 2500 species grown worldwide, they are an attractive source of phytochemical therapeutics. The chemical structure and biosynthesis of SQs is complex, and the SQ scaffold represents extraordinary structural variety consisting of both acyclic and cyclic (mono, bi, tri, and tetracyclic) compounds. These structures can be decorated with a diverse range of functional groups and substituents, generating many stereospecific configurations. In this review, the effect of SQs on inflammation will be discussed in the context of their complex chemistry. Because inflammation is a multifactorial process, we focus on specific aspects of inflammation: the inhibition of NF-kB signaling, disruption of NO production and modulation of dendritic cells, mast cells, and monocytes. Although the molecular targets of SQs are varied, we discuss how these pathways may mediate the effects of SQs on inflammation.

The Uncertain Role of Biogenic VOC for Boundary-Layer Ozone Concentration: Example Investigation of Emissions from Two Forest Types with a Box Model,"
High levels of air pollution including ground level ozone significantly reduce humans’ life expectancy and cause forest damage and decreased tree growth. The French Vosges and the German Black Forest are regions well-known for having the highest tropospheric ozone concentrations at remote forested sites in Central Europe. This box model study investigates the sensitivity of atmospheric chemistry calculations of derived ozone on differently resolved forest tree composition and volatile organic compound emissions. Representative conditions were chosen for the Upper Rhine area including the Alsatian Vosges/France and the Black Forest/Germany during summer. This study aims to answer the following question: What level of input detail for Alsace and Black Forest tree mixtures is required to accurately simulate ozone formation? While the French forest in Alsace—e.g., in the Vosges—emits isoprene to a substantially higher extent than the forest at the German site, total monoterpene emissions at the two sites are rather similar. However, the individual monoterpene structures, and therefore their reactivity, differs. This causes a higher ozone production rate for Vosges forest mixture conditions than for Black Forest tree mixtures at identical NOx levels, with the difference increasing with temperature. The difference in ozone formation is analyzed in detail and the short-comings of reduced descriptions are discussed. The outcome serves as a to-do-list to allow accurate future ozone predictions influenced by the climate adaptation of forests and the change in forest species composition.

Therapeutic Potential of Volatile Terpenes and Terpenoids from Forests for Inflammatory Diseases,"
Forest trees are a major source of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Terpenes and terpenoids are known as the main BVOCs of forest aerosols. These compounds have been shown to display a broad range of biological activities in various human disease models, thus implying that forest aerosols containing these compounds may be related to beneficial effects of forest bathing. In this review, we surveyed studies analyzing BVOCs and selected the most abundant 23 terpenes and terpenoids emitted in forested areas of the Northern Hemisphere, which were reported to display anti-inflammatory activities. We categorized anti-inflammatory processes related to the functions of these compounds into six groups and summarized their molecular mechanisms of action. Finally, among the major 23 compounds, we examined the therapeutic potentials of 12 compounds known to be effective against respiratory inflammation, atopic dermatitis, arthritis, and neuroinflammation among various inflammatory diseases. In conclusion, the updated studies support the beneficial effects of forest aerosols and propose their potential use as chemopreventive and therapeutic agents for treating various inflammatory diseases.

Tissue-Specific Expression of the Terpene Synthase Family Genes in Rosa chinensis and Effect of Abiotic Stress Conditions,"
Rose (Rosa chinensis) is one of the most famous ornamental plants worldwide, with a variety of colors and fragrances. Terpene synthases (TPSs) play critical roles in the biosynthesis of terpenes. In this work, we report a comprehensive study on the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TPS family in R. chinensis. We identified 49 TPS genes in the R. chinensis genome, and they were grouped into five subfamilies (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, TPS-g and TPS-e/f). Phylogenetics, gene structure and conserved motif analyses indicated that the RcTPS genes possessed relatively conserved gene structures and the RcTPS proteins contained relatively conserved motifs. Multiple putative cis-acting elements involved in the stress response were identified in the promoter region of RcTPS genes, suggesting that some could be regulated by stress. The expression profile of RcTPS genes showed that they were predominantly expressed in the petals of open flowers, pistils, leaves and roots. Under osmotic and heat stresses, the expression of most RcTPS genes was upregulated. These data provide a useful foundation for deciphering the functional roles of RcTPS genes during plant growth as well as addressing the link between terpene biosynthesis and abiotic stress responses in roses.

Transcriptome and Metabolome Dynamics Explain Aroma Differences between Green and Red Prickly Ash Fruit,"
Green prickly ash (Zanthoxylum armatum) and red prickly ash (Zanthoxylum bungeanum) fruit have unique flavor and aroma characteristics that affect consumers’ purchasing preferences. However, differences in aroma components and relevant biosynthesis genes have not been systematically investigated in green and red prickly ash. Here, through the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially abundant metabolites, and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, we characterize the different aroma components of green and red prickly ash fruits and identify key genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify 41 terpenoids from green prickly ash and 61 terpenoids from red prickly ash. Piperitone was the most abundant terpenoid in green prickly ash fruit, whereas limonene was most abundant in red prickly ash. Intergroup correlation analysis and redundancy analysis showed that HDS2, MVK2, and MVD are key genes for terpenoid synthesis in green prickly ash, whereas FDPS2 and FDPS3 play an important role in the terpenoid synthesis of red prickly ash. In summary, differences in the composition and content of terpenoids are the main factors that cause differences in the aromas of green and red prickly ash, and these differences reflect contrasting expression patterns of terpenoid synthesis genes.

Traps and Pitfalls—Unspecific Reactions in Metabolic Engineering of Sesquiterpenoid Pathways,"
The characterization of plant enzymes by expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic (yeast and plants) heterologous hosts has widely been used in recent decades to elucidate metabolic pathways in plant secondary metabolism. Yeast and plant systems provide the cellular environment of a eukaryotic cell and the subcellular compartmentalization necessary to facilitate enzyme function. The expression of candidate genes in these cell systems and the identification of the resulting products guide the way for the identification of enzymes with new functions. However, in many cases, the detected compounds are not the direct enzyme products but are caused by unspecific subsequent reactions. Even if the mechanisms for these unspecific reactions are in many cases widely reported, there is a lack of overview of potential reactions that may occur to provide a guideline for researchers working on the characterization of new enzymes. Here, an across-the-board summary of rearrangement reactions of sesquiterpenes in metabolic pathway engineering is presented. The different kinds of unspecific reactions as well as their chemical and cellular background are explained and strategies how to spot and how to avoid these unspecific reactions are given. Also, a systematic approach of classification of unspecific reactions is introduced. It is hoped that this mini-review will stimulate a discussion on how to systematically classify unspecific reactions in metabolic engineering and to expand this approach to other classes of plant secondary metabolites.

Volatile Metabolites,"
Volatile organic compounds (volatiles) comprise a chemically diverse class of low molecular weight organic compounds having an appreciable vapor pressure under ambient conditions. Volatiles produced by plants attract pollinators and seed dispersers, and provide defense against pests and pathogens. For insects, volatiles may act as pheromones directing social behavior or as cues for finding hosts or prey. For humans, volatiles are important as flavorants and as possible disease biomarkers. The marine environment is also a major source of halogenated and sulfur-containing volatiles which participate in the global cycling of these elements. While volatile analysis commonly measures a rather restricted set of analytes, the diverse and extreme physical properties of volatiles provide unique analytical challenges. Volatiles constitute only a small proportion of the total number of metabolites produced by living organisms, however, because of their roles as signaling molecules (semiochemicals) both within and between organisms, accurately measuring and determining the roles of these compounds is crucial to an integrated understanding of living systems. This review summarizes recent developments in volatile research from a metabolomics perspective with a focus on the role of recent technical innovation in developing new areas of volatile research and expanding the range of ecological interactions which may be mediated by volatile organic metabolites.

Volatile Terpenes and Terpenoids from Workers and Queens of Monomorium chinense (Hymenoptera: Formicidae),"
Twenty-one volatile terpenes and terpenoids were found in Monomorium chinense Santschi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a native Chinese ant, by using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas-phase chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which makes this ant one of the most prolific terpene producers in insect. A sesquiterpene with unknown structure (terpene 1) was the main terpene in workers and neocembrene in queens. Terpenes and terpenoids were detected in poison, Dufour’s and mandibular glands of both workers and queens. Worker ants raised on a terpene-free diet showed the same terpene profile as ants collected in the field, indicating that de novo terpene and terpenoid synthesis occurs in M. chinense.

Volatiles Emitted at Different Flowering Stages of Jasminum sambac and Expression of Genes Related to a-Farnesene Biosynthesis,"
Fresh jasmine flowers have been used to make jasmine teas in China, but there has been no complete information about volatile organic compound emissions in relation to flower developmental stages and no science-based knowledge about which floral stage should be used for the infusion. This study monitored volatile organic compounds emitted from living flowers of Jasminum sambac (L.) Ait. ‘Bifoliatum’ at five developmental stages and also from excised flowers. Among the compounds identified, a-farnesene, linalool, and benzyl acetate were most abundant. Since a-farnesene is synthesized through the Mevalonate pathway, four genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and terpene synthase were isolated. Their expression patterns in living flowers at the five stages and in excised flowers coincided with the emission patterns of a-farnesene. Application of lovastatin, a HMGR inhibitor, significantly reduced the expression of the genes and greatly decreased the emission of a-farnesene. The sweet scent was diminished from lovastatin-treated flowers as well. These results indicate that a-farnesene is an important compound emitted from jasmine flowers, and its emission patterns suggest that flowers at the opening stage or flower buds 8 h after excision should be used for the infusion of tea leaves.

Microbial Synthesis of Pinene,"The volumetric heating values of today’s biofuels are too low to power energy-intensive aircraft, rockets, and missiles. Recently, pinene dimers were shown to have a volumetric heating value similar to that of the tactical fuel JP-10. To provide a sustainable source of pinene, we engineered Escherichia coli for pinene production. We combinatorially expressed three pinene synthases (PS) and three geranyl diphosphate synthases (GPPS), with the best combination achieving ~28 mg/L of pinene. We speculated that pinene toxicity was limiting production; however, toxicity should not be limiting at current titers. Because GPPS is inhibited by geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and to increase flux through the pathway, we combinatorially constructed GPPS-PS protein fusions. The Abies grandis GPPS-PS fusion produced 32 mg/L of pinene, a 6-fold improvement over the highest titer previously reported in engineered E. coli. Finally, we investigated the pinene isomer ratio of our pinene-producing microbe and discovered that the isomer profile is determined not only by the identity of the PS used but also by the identity of the GPPS with which the PS is paired. We demonstrated that the GPP concentration available to PS for cyclization alters the pinene isomer ratio."
Pathway-Based Metabolomics Analysis Reveals Biosynthesis of Key Flavor Compounds in Mango,"Mango is a tropical fruit with global demand as a result of its high sensory quality and nutritional attributes. Improving fruit quality at the consumer level could increase demand, but fruit quality is a complex trait requiring a deep understanding of flavor development to uncover key pathways that could become targets for improving sensory quality. Here, a pathway-based metabolomics (untargeted and targeted) approach was used to explore biosynthetic mechanisms of key flavor compounds with five core metabolic pathways (butanoate metabolism, phenylalanine biosynthesis and metabolism, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, linoleic and linolenic acid pathway, and carbon fixation and sucrose metabolism) in three mango cultivars. The relationships between flavor precursors and flavor compounds were identified using correlation analysis. With these novel strategies, differentially regulated metabolic flux through the pathways was first elucidated, demonstrating possible mechanisms of key flavor formation and regulation in mango fruits."
Wounding-Induced VOC Emissions in Five Tropical Agricultural Species,"
Leaf mechanical wounding triggers a rapid release—within minutes—of a blend of volatile organic compounds. A wounding-induced VOC blend is mainly composed of oxygenated ubiquitous stress volatiles such as methanol and volatile products of lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway (mainly C5 and C6 alcohols and aldehydes and their derivatives), but also includes multiple minor VOCs that collectively act as infochemicals, inducing defences in non-damaged plant leaves and neighbouring plants and attracting herbivore enemies. At present, the interspecific variability of the rate of induction and magnitude of wounding-induced emissions and the extent to which plant structural traits and physiological activity alter these emissions are poorly known. Particularly scarce is information on the induced emissions in tropical agricultural plant species, despite their economic importance and large area of cultivation at regional and global scales. We chose five tropical crops with varying photosynthetic activity and leaf structural characteristics—Abelmoschus esculentus, Amaranthus cruentus, Amaranthus hybridus, Solanum aethiopicum, and Telfairia occidentalis—to characterize the kinetics and magnitude of wounding-induced emissions, hypothesizing that the induced emission response is greater and faster in physiologically more active species with greater photosynthetic activity than in less active species. Rapid highly repeatable leaf wounds (12 mm cuts) were generated by a within-leaf-chamber cutting knife. Wounding-induced VOC emissions were measured continuously with a proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer and gas-chromatography mass spectrometry was used to separate isomers. Twenty-three ion VOCs and twelve terpenoid molecule structures were identified, whereas ubiquitous stress volatiles methanol (on average 40% of total emissions), hexenal (24%), and acetaldehyde (11%) were the main compounds across the species. Emissions of low-weight oxygenated compounds (LOC, 70% of total) and LOX products (29%) were positively correlated across species, but minor VOC components, monoterpenoids and benzenoids, were negatively correlated with LOC and LOX, indicating a reverse relationship between signal specificity and strength. There was a large interspecific variability in the rate of induction and emission magnitude, but the hypothesis of a stronger emission response in physiologically more active species was only partly supported. In addition, the overall emission levels were somewhat lower with different emission blend compared to the data reported for wild species, as well as different shares for the VOCs in the blend. The study demonstrates that wounding-dependent emissions from tropical agricultural crops can significantly contribute to atmospheric volatiles, and these emissions cannot be predicted based on current evidence of wild plant model systems.

A unified mechanism of action for volatile isoprenoids in plant abiotic stress,"The sessile nature of plants has resulted in the evolution of an extraordinarily diverse suite of protective mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses. Though volatile isoprenoids are known to be involved in many types of biotic interactions, they also play important but relatively unappreciated roles in abiotic stress responses. We review those roles, discuss the proposed mechanistic explanations and examine the evolutionary significance of volatile isoprenoid emission. We note that abiotic stress responses generically involve production of reactive oxygen species in plant cells, and volatile isoprenoids mitigate the effects of oxidative stress by mediating the oxidative status of the plant. On the basis of these observations, we propose a 'single biochemical mechanism for multiple physiological stressors' model, whereby the protective effect against abiotic stress is exerted through direct or indirect improvement in resistance to damage by reactive oxygen species."
Redirection of cytosolic or plastidic isoprenoid precursors elevates terpene production in plants,"Terpenes constitute a distinct class of natural products1 that attract insects2, defend against phytopathogenic microbes3 and combat human diseases4. However, like most natural products, they are usually made by plants and microbes in small amounts and as complex mixtures. Chemical synthesis is often costly and inefficient, and may not yield enantiomerically pure terpenes, whereas large-scale microbial production requires expensive feedstocks. We engineered high-level terpene production in tobacco plants by diverting carbon flow from cytosolic or plastidic isopentenyl diphosphate through overexpression in either compartment of an avian farnesyl diphosphate synthase and an appropriate terpene synthase. Isotopic labeling studies suggest little, if any, metabolite exchange between these two subcellular compartments. The strategy increased synthesis of the sesquiterpenes patchoulol and amorpha-4,11-diene more than 1,000-fold, as well as the monoterpene limonene 10–30 fold, and seems equally suited to generating higher levels of other terpenes for research, industrial production or therapeutic applications."
Strong sesquiterpene emissions from Amazonian soils,"The Amazon rainforest is the world’s largest source of reactive volatile isoprenoids to the atmosphere. It is generally assumed that these emissions are products of photosynthetically driven secondary metabolism and released from the rainforest canopy from where they influence the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. However, recent measurements indicate that further sources of volatiles are present. Here we show that soil microorganisms are a strong, unaccounted source of highly reactive and previously unreported sesquiterpenes (C15H24; SQT). The emission rate and chemical speciation of soil SQTs were determined as a function of soil moisture, oxygen, and rRNA transcript abundance in the laboratory. Based on these results, a model was developed to predict soil–atmosphere SQT fluxes. It was found SQT emissions from a Terra Firme soil in the dry season were in comparable magnitude to current global model canopy emissions, establishing an important ecological connection between soil microbes and atmospherically relevant SQTs."
Studies on Biosynthetic Genes and Enzymes of Isoprenoids Produced by Actinomycetes,"Most Streptomyces strains are equipped with only the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway for the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate, a common precursor of isoprenoids. In addition to this pathway, some Streptomyces strains possess the mevalonate (MV) pathway via which isoprenoid antibiotics are produced. We have recently cloned and analyzed the MV pathway gene clusters and their flanking regions from terpentecin, BE-40644, and furaquinocin A producers. All these clusters contained genes coding for mevalonate kinase, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase, phosphomevalonate kinase, type 2 IPP isomerase, HMG-CoA reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase. The order of each of the open reading frames (ORFs) is also the same, and the respective homologous ORFs show more than 70% amino acid identity with each other. In contrast to these conservative gene organizations, the biosynthetic genes of terpentecin, BE-40644, and furaquinocin A were located just upstream and/or downstream of the MV pathway gene cluster. These facts suggested that all the actinomycete strains possessing both the MV and MEP pathways produce isoprenoid compounds and the biosynthetic genes of one of these isoprenoids usually exist adjacent to the MV pathway gene cluster. Therefore, when the presence of the MV cluster is detected by molecular genetic techniques, isoprenoids may be produced by the cultivation of these actinomycete strains. During the course of these studies, we identified diterpene cyclases possessing unique primary structures that differ from those of eukaryotes and catalyze unique reactions."
Volatile diterpene emission by two Mediterranean Cistaceae shrubs,"Mediterranean vegetation emits a wide range of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) among which isoprenoids present quantitatively the most important compound class. Here, we investigated the isoprenoid emission from two Mediterranean Cistaceae shrubs, Halimium halimifolium and Cistus ladanifer, under controlled and natural conditions, respectively. For the first time, diurnal emission patterns of the diterpene kaurene were detected in real-time by Proton-Transfer-Reaction-Time-of-Flight-Mass-Spectrometer. Kaurene emissions were strongly variable among H. halimifolium plants, ranging from 0.01?±?0.003 to 0.06?±?0.01 nmol m-2 s-1 in low and high emitting individuals, respectively. They were in the same order of magnitude as monoterpene (0.01?±?0.01 to 0.11?±?0.04 nmol m-2 s-1) and sesquiterpene (0.01?±?0.01 to 0.52 nmol m-2 s-1) emission rates. Comparable range and variability was found for C. ladanifer under natural conditions. Labelling with 13C-pyruvate suggested that emitted kaurene was not derived from de novo biosynthesis. The high kaurene content in leaves, the weak relationship with ecophysiological parameters and the tendency of higher emissions with increasing temperatures in the field indicate an emission from storage pools. This study highlights significant emissions of kaurene from two Mediterranean shrub species, indicating that the release of diterpenes into the atmosphere should probably deserve more attention in the future."
Assembly-Line Catalysis in Bifunctional Terpene Synthases,"The magnificent chemodiversity of more than 95?000 terpenoid natural products identified to date largely originates from catalysis by two types of terpene synthases, prenyltransferases and cyclases. Prenyltransferases utilize 5-carbon building blocks in processive chain elongation reactions to generate linear C5n isoprenoid diphosphates (n = 2), which in turn serve as substrates for terpene cyclases that convert these linear precursors into structurally complex hydrocarbon products containing multiple rings and stereocenters. Terpene cyclization reactions are the most complex organic transformations found in nature in that more than half of the substrate carbon atoms undergo changes in chemical bonding during a multistep reaction sequence proceeding through several carbocation intermediates. Two general classes of cyclases are established on the basis of the chemistry of initial carbocation formation, and structural studies from our laboratory and others show that three fundamental protein folds designated a, ß, and ? govern this chemistry. Catalysis by a class I cyclase occurs in an a domain, where a trinuclear metal cluster activates the substrate diphosphate leaving group to generate an allylic cation. Catalysis by a class II cyclase occurs in a ß domain or at the interface of ß and ? domains, where an aspartic acid protonates the terminal p bond of the substrate to yield a tertiary carbocation. Crystal structures reveal domain architectures of a, aß, aß?, ß?, and ß."
Biosynthesis of Mono- and Sesquiterpenes in Strawberry Fruits and Foliage:? 2H Labeling Studies,"The biosynthesis of the monoterpene (S)-linalool and the sesquiterpene trans-(S)-nerolidol in fruits of Fragaria × ananassa Duch. cv. Eros and Florence and of the monoterpene (-)-a-pinene in Fragaria vesca was investigated by in vivo feeding experiments with [5,5-2H2]mevalonic acid lactone (d2-MVL) and [5,5-2H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose (d2-DOX). The feeding experiments indicate that (S)-linalool and trans-(S)-nerolidol in Fragaria × ananassa Duch. and (-)-a-pinene in F. vesca are exclusively synthesized via the cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway without any contribution from the plastidial 1-deoxy-d-xylulose/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (DOXP/MEP) route. Inhibition experiments revealed that even the presence of mevastatin, an export of plastid-derived isopentyl diphosphate/dimethylallyl diphosphate, cannot be induced. However, the enantioselective analysis shows that in Fragaria × ananassa Duch. cv. Eros and Florence both linalool enantiomers are present and that only (S)-linalool is labeled after administration of d2-MVL. Therefore, the origin of (R)-linalool in these fruits remains unknown. Contrarily, in Fragaria × ananassa Duch. foliage (R)-linalool is the dominant enantiomer. Feeding experiments revealed an incorporation of d2-MVL and d2-DOX at equal rates exclusively into (S)-linalool. Only in F. vesca foliage, where (R)-linalool is present at high enantiomeric purity (ee > 90%), is a de novo biosynthesis of the (R)-enantiomer via the DOXP/MEP pathway detectable. These results demonstrate a complex intraplant variation of (R)- and (S)-linalool biosynthesis via the cytosolic and plastidial route."
Biosynthesis of Monoterpenes and Norisoprenoids in Raspberry Fruits (Rubus idaeus L.): The Role of Cytosolic Mevalonate and Plastidial Methylerythritol Phosphate Pathway,"The biosynthesis of the monoterpenes (-)-a-pinene, linalool, and the norisoprenoids a- and ß-ionone in raspberry fruits (rubus idaeus L.) was investigated by in vivo feeding experiments with [5,5-2H2]-mevalonic acid lactone and [5,5-2H2]-1-deoxy-D-xylulose. The volatile compounds were extracted by stirbar sorptive extraction and analyzed using thermal desorption-multidimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-enantio-MDGC-MS). The feeding experiments demonstrate that (-)-a-pinene and (S)-linalool are exclusively synthesized via the cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway. In contrast, 2H-labeled (R)-(E)-a-ionone and 2H-labeled (E)-ß-ionone are detectable after application of d2-1-deoxy-D-xylulose and d2-mevalonic acid lactone, respectively. However, (R)-linalool reveals no incorporation of either one of the fed precursors, even though this enantiomer is detectable in the fruit tissue."
"Bisabolyl-Derived Sesquiterpenes from Tobacco 5-Epi-aristolochene Synthase-Catalyzed Cyclization of (2Z,6E)-Farnesyl Diphosphate","We report the structures and stereochemistry of seven bisabolyl-derived sesquiterpenes arising from an unprecedented 1,6-cyclization (cisoid pathway) efficiently catalyzed by tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (TEAS). The use of (2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate as an alternate substrate for recombinant TEAS resulted in a robust enzymatic cyclization to an array of products derived exclusively (=99.5%) from the cisoid pathway, whereas these same products account for ca. 2.5% of the total hydrocarbons obtained using (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate. Chromatographic fractionations of extracts from preparative incubations with the 2Z,6E substrate afforded, in addition to the acyclic allylic alcohols (2Z,6E)-farnesol (6.7%) and nerolidol (3.6%), five cyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and two cyclic sesquiterpene alcohols: (+)-2-epi-prezizaene (44%), (-)-a-cedrene (21.5%), (R)-(-)-ß-curcumene (15.5%), a-acoradiene (3.9%), 4-epi-a-acoradiene (1.3%), and equal amounts of a-bisabolol (1.8%) and epi-a-bisalolol (1.8%). The structures, stereochemistry, and enantiopurities were established by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, optical rotations, chemical correlations with known sesquiterpenes, comparisons with literature data, and GC analyses. The major product, (+)-2-epi-prezizaene, is structurally related to the naturally occurring tricyclic alcohol, jinkohol (2-epi-prezizaan-7ß-ol). Cisoid cyclization pathways are proposed by which all five sesquiterpene hydrocarbons are derived from a common (7R)-ß-bisabolyl+/pyrophosphate- ion pair intermediate. The implications of the “cisoid” catalytic activity of TEAS are discussed."
Cannabis Inflorescence for Medical Purposes: USP Considerations for Quality Attributes,"There is an active and growing interest in cannabis female inflorescence (Cannabis sativa) for medical purposes. Therefore, a definition of its quality attributes can help mitigate public health risks associated with contaminated, substandard, or adulterated products and support sound and reproducible basic and clinical research. As cannabis is a heterogeneous matrix that can contain a complex secondary metabolome with an uneven distribution of constituents, ensuring its quality requires appropriate sampling procedures and a suite of tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria to define the identity, content of constituents (e.g., cannabinoids), and limits on contaminants. As an independent science-based public health organization, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has formed a Cannabis Expert Panel, which has evaluated specifications necessary to define key cannabis quality attributes. The consensus within the expert panel was that these specifications should differentiate between cannabis chemotypes. Based on the secondary metabolite profiles, the expert panel has suggested adoption of three broad categories of cannabis. These three main chemotypes have been identified as useful for labeling based on the following cannabinoid constituents: (1) tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-dominant chemotype; (2) intermediate chemotype with both THC and cannabidiol (CBD); and (3) CBD-dominant chemotype. Cannabis plants in each of these chemotypes may be further subcategorized based on the content of other cannabinoids and/or mono- and sesquiterpene profiles. Morphological and chromatographic tests are presented for the identification and quantitative determination of critical constituents. Limits for contaminants including pesticide residues, microbial levels, mycotoxins, and elemental contaminants are presented based on toxicological considerations and aligned with the existing USP procedures for general tests and assays. The principles outlined in this review should be able to be used as the basis of public quality specifications for cannabis inflorescence, which are needed for public health protection and to facilitate scientific research on cannabis safety and therapeutic potential."
Direct Conversion of CO2 to a-Farnesene Using Metabolically Engineered Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942,"Direct conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value-added chemicals by engineering of cyanobacteria has received attention as a sustainable strategy in food and chemical industries. Herein, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, a model cyanobacterium, was engineered to produce a-farnesene from CO2. As a result of the lack of farnesene synthase (FS) activity in the wild-type cyanobacterium, we metabolically engineered S. elongatus PCC 7942 to express heterologous FS from either Norway spruce or apple fruit, resulting in detectable peaks of a-farnesene. To enhance a-farnesene production, an optimized methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway was introduced in the farnesene-producing strain to supply farnesyl diphosphate. Subsequent cyanobacterial culture with a dodecane overlay resulted in photosynthetic production of a-farnesene (4.6 ± 0.4 mg/L in 7 days) from CO2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the photosynthetic production of a-farnesene from CO2 in the unicellular cyanobacterium S. elongatus PCC 7942."
Dissecting Sesquiterpene Profiles of Lemberger Red Wines Using Ex Vivo Tissue Deuterium-Labeling and Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography–Time-of-Flight–Mass Spectrometry,"By means of ex vivo tissue deuterium-labeling using the stable isotope-labeled precursor [6,6,6-2H3]-(±)-mevalonolactone and microvinification experiments, we were able to show for the first time that the three sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, guaiazulene, d-selinene, and selina-3,7(11)-diene, in Lemberger red wines do not originate from acid-catalyzed cyclization of yeast-derived farnesol and nerolidol. The three aforementioned sesquiterpene hydrocarbons could be unambiguously identified as grape-derived secondary metabolites and can therefore be considered as variety-specific marker compounds. The analysis of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in red wine samples was performed by solid-phase extraction–headspace solid-phase microextraction–comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography–time of flight–mass spectrometry. The developed methodology paves the way for an analytical verification of grape variety labeling in wine authenticity control."
Engineering Plant Sesquiterpene Synthesis into Yeasts: A Review,"Sesquiterpenes are natural compounds composed of three isoprene units. They represent the largest class of terpene compounds found in plants, and many have remarkable biological activities. Furthermore, sesquiterpenes have broad applications in the flavor, pharmaceutical and biofuel industries due to their complex structures. With the development of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, the production of different sesquiterpenes has been realized in various chassis microbes. The microbial production of sesquiterpenes provides a promising alternative to plant extraction and chemical synthesis, enabling us to meet the increasing market demand. In this review, we summarized the heterologous production of different plant sesquiterpenes using the eukaryotic yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica, followed by a discussion of common metabolic engineering strategies used in this field."
Experiment and Simulation Reveal How Mutations in Functional Plasticity Regions Guide Plant Monoterpene Synthase Product Outcome,"Monoterpenes (C10 isoprenoids) are a structurally diverse group of natural compounds that are attractive to industry as flavors and fragrances. Monoterpenes are produced from a single linear substrate, geranyl diphosphate, by a group of enzymes called the monoterpene cyclases/synthases (mTC/Ss) that catalyze high-energy cyclization reactions involving unstable carbocation intermediates. Efforts toward producing monoterpenes via biocatalysis or metabolic engineering often result in the formation of multiple products due to the nature of the highly branched reaction mechanism of mTC/Ss. Rational engineering of mTC/Ss is hampered by the lack of correlation between the active site sequence and cyclization type. We used available mutagenesis data to show that amino acids involved in product outcome are clustered and spatially conserved within the mTC/S family. Consensus sequences for three such plasticity regions were introduced in different mTC/S with increasingly complex cyclization cascades, including the model enzyme limonene synthase (LimS). In all three mTC/Ss studied, mutations in the first two regions mostly give rise to products that result from premature quenching of the linalyl or a-terpinyl cations, suggesting that both plasticity regions are involved in the formation and stabilization of cations early in the reaction cascade. A LimS variant with mutations in the second region (S454G, C457V, M458I), produced mainly more complex bicyclic products. QM/MM MD simulations reveal that the second cyclization is not due to compression of the C2–C7 distance in the a-terpinyl cation but is the result of an increased distance between C8 of the a-terpinyl cation and two putative bases (W324, H579) located on the other side of the active site, preventing early termination by deprotonation. Such insights into the effect of mutations can only be obtained using integrated experimental and computational approaches and will aid the design of altered mTC/S activities toward clean monoterpenoid products."
Harnessing Yeast Peroxisomes and Cytosol Acetyl-CoA for Sesquiterpene a-Humulene Production,"Metabolic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae focusing on the cytoplasm for sustainable terpenoid production is commonly practiced. However, engineering organelles for terpenoid production is rarely reported. Herein, peroxisomes, together with the cytoplasm, were engineered to boost sesquiterpene a-humulene synthesis in S. cerevisiae. The farnesyl diphosphate synthetic pathway and a-humulene synthase were successfully expressed inside yeast peroxisomes to enable high-level a-humulene production with glucose as the sole carbon source. With the combination of peroxisomal and cytoplasmic engineering, a-humulene production was increased by 2.5-fold compared to that in cytoplasm-engineered recombinant strains. Finally, the a-humulene titer of 1726.78 mg/L was achieved by fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor. The strategy presented here offers an efficient method for terpenoid production in S. cerevisiae."
Identification and Characterization of Terpene Synthases Potentially Involved in the Formation of Volatile Terpenes in Carrot (Daucus carota L.) Roots,"Plants produce an excess of volatile organic compounds, which are important in determining the quality and nutraceutical properties of fruit and root crops, including the taste and aroma of carrots (Daucus carota L.). A combined chemical, biochemical, and molecular study was conducted to evaluate the differential accumulation of volatile terpenes in a diverse collection of fresh carrots (D. carota L.). Here, we report on a transcriptome-based identification and functional characterization of two carrot terpene synthases, the sesquiterpene synthase, DcTPS1, and the monoterpene synthase, DcTPS2. Recombinant DcTPS1 protein produces mainly (E)-ß-caryophyllene, the predominant sesquiterpene in carrot roots, and a-humulene, while recombinant DcTPS2 functions as a monoterpene synthase with geraniol as the main product. Both genes are differentially transcribed in different cultivars and during carrot root development. Our results suggest a role for DcTPS genes in carrot aroma biosynthesis."
Metabolic Engineering Strategies for Sustainable Terpenoid Flavor and Fragrance Synthesis,"Terpenoids derived from plant material are widely applied in the flavor and fragrance industry. Traditional extraction methods are unsustainable, but microbial synthesis offers a promising solution to attain efficient production of natural-identical terpenoids. Overproduction of terpenoids in microbes requires careful balancing of the synthesis pathway constituents within the constraints of host cell metabolism. Advances in metabolic engineering have greatly facilitated overcoming the challenges of achieving high titers, rates, and yields (TRYs). The review summarizes recent development in the molecular biology toolbox to achieve high TRYs for terpenoid biosynthesis, mainly in the two industrial platform microorganisms: Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The biosynthetic pathways, including alternative pathway designs, are briefly introduced, followed by recently developed methodologies used for pathway, genome, and strain optimization. Integrated applications of these tools are important to achieve high “TRYs” of terpenoid production and pave the way for translating laboratory research into successful commercial manufacturing."
Microbial Cell Factories for the Production of Terpenoid Flavor and Fragrance Compounds,"Terpenoid flavor and fragrance compounds are of high interest to the aroma industry. Microbial production offers an alternative sustainable access to the desired terpenoids independent of natural sources. Genetically engineered microorganisms can be used to synthesize terpenoids from cheap and renewable resources. Due to its modular architecture, terpenoid biosynthesis is especially well suited for the microbial cell factory concept: a platform host engineered for a high flux toward the central C5 prenyl diphosphate precursors enables the production of a broad range of target terpenoids just by varying the pathway modules converting the C5 intermediates to the product of interest. In this review typical terpenoid flavor and fragrance compounds marketed or under development by biotech and aroma companies are given, and the specificities of the aroma market are discussed. The main part of this work focuses on key strategies and recent advances to engineer microbes to become efficient terpenoid producers."
"Production of the Pepper Aroma Compound, (-)-Rotundone, by Aerial Oxidation of a-Guaiene","The aroma link between pepper and wine has recently been elucidated to be due to the important aroma compound rotundone. To date, rotundone is the only known impact odorant with a peppery aroma. Although the concentration found in products of natural origin is small, the odor detection threshold is among the lowest of any natural product yet discovered. We report herein the identification of the first known precursor to rotundone, namely, a-guaiene, and that one mechanism of transformation is simple aerial oxidation."
Qualitative and Quantitative Characterization of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Cut Grass,"Mechanical wounding of plants triggers the release of a blend of reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). During and after mowing and harvesting of managed grasslands, significant BVOC emissions have the potential to alter the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere and lead to ozone and aerosol formation with consequences for regional air quality. We show that the amount and composition of BVOCs emitted per unit dry weight of plant material is comparable between laboratory enclosure measurements of artificially severed grassland plant species and in situ ecosystem-scale flux measurements above a temperate mountain grassland during and after periodic mowing and harvesting. The investigated grassland ecosystem emitted annually up to 130 mg carbon m–2 in response to cutting and drying, the largest part being consistently represented by methanol and a blend of green leaf volatiles (GLV). In addition, we report the plant species-specific emission of furfural, terpenoid-like compounds (e.g., camphor), and sesquiterpenes from cut plant material, which may be used as tracers for the presence of given plant species in the ecosystem."
Rapid Discrimination and Feature Extraction of Three Chamaecyparis Species by Static-HS/GC–MS,"This study aimed to develop a rapid and accurate analytical method for discriminating three Chamaecyparis species (C. formosensis, C. obtusa, and C. obtusa var. formosana) that could not be easily distinguished by volatile compounds. A total of 23 leaf samples from three species were analyzed by static-headspace (static-HS) coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The static-HS procedure, whose experimental parameters were properly optimized, yielded a high Pearson correlation-based similarity between essential oil and VOC composition (r = 0.555–0.999). Thirty-six major constituents were identified; along with the results of cluster analysis (CA), a large variation in contents among the three different species was observed. Principal component analysis (PCA) methods illustrated graphically the relationships between characteristic components and tree species. It was clearly demonstrated that the static-HS-based procedure enhanced greatly the speed of precise analysis of chemical fingerprint in small sample amounts, thus providing a fast and reliable tool for the prediction of constituent characteristics in essential oil, and also offering good opportunities for studying the role of these feature compounds in chemotaxonomy or ecophysiology."
Recent Advances in the Biosynthesis of Farnesene Using Metabolic Engineering,"Farnesene, as an important sesquiterpene isoprenoid polymer of acetyl-CoA, is a renewable feedstock for diesel fuel, polymers, and cosmetics. It has been widely applied in agriculture, medicine, energy, and other fields. In recent years, farnesene biosynthesis is considered a green and economical approach because of its mild reaction conditions, low environmental pollution, and sustainability. Metabolic engineering has been widely applied to construct cell factories for farnesene biosynthesis. In this paper, the research progress, common problems, and strategies of farnesene biosynthesis are reviewed. They are mainly described from the perspectives of the current status of farnesene biosynthesis in different host cells, optimization of the metabolic pathway for farnesene biosynthesis, and key enzymes for farnesene biosynthesis. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for future farnesene biosynthesis are discussed."
Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation and Organic Nitrate Yield from NO3 Oxidation of Biogenic Hydrocarbons,"The secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass yields from NO3 oxidation of a series of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), consisting of five monoterpenes and one sesquiterpene (a-pinene, ß-pinene, ?-3-carene, limonene, sabinene, and ß-caryophyllene), were investigated in a series of continuous flow experiments in a 10 m3 indoor Teflon chamber. By making in situ measurements of the nitrate radical and employing a kinetics box model, we generate time-dependent yield curves as a function of reacted BVOC. SOA yields varied dramatically among the different BVOCs, from zero for a-pinene to 38–65% for ?-3-carene and 86% for ß-caryophyllene at mass loading of 10 µg m–3, suggesting that model mechanisms that treat all NO3 + monoterpene reactions equally will lead to errors in predicted SOA depending on each location’s mix of BVOC emissions. In most cases, organonitrate is a dominant component of the aerosol produced, but in the case of a-pinene, little organonitrate and no aerosol is formed."
Sodorifen Biosynthesis in the Rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica Involves Methylation and Cyclization of MEP-Derived Farnesyl Pyrophosphate by a SAM-Dependent C-Methyltransferase,"The rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica 4Rx13 releases a unique polymethylated hydrocarbon (C16H26) with a bicyclo[3.2.1]octadiene skeleton called sodorifen. Sodorifen production depends on a gene cluster carrying a C-methyltransferase and a terpene cyclase along with two enzymes of the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Comparative analysis of wild-type and mutant volatile organic compound profiles revealed a C-methyltransferase-dependent C16 alcohol called pre-sodorifen, the production of which is upregulated in the terpene cyclase mutant. The monocyclic structure of this putative intermediate in sodorifen biosynthesis was identified by NMR spectroscopy. In vitro assays with the heterologously expressed S. plymuthica C-methyltransferase and terpene cyclase demonstrated that these enzymes act sequentially to convert farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) into sodorifen via a pre-sodorifen pyrophosphate intermediate, indicating that the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent C-methyltransferase from S. plymuthica exhibits unprecedented cyclase activity. In vivo incorporation experiments with 13C-labeled succinate, l-alanine, and l-methionine confirmed a MEP pathway to FPP via the canonical glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate, as well as its SAM-dependent methylation in pre-sodorifen and sodorifen biosynthesis. 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy facilitated the localization of 13C labels and provided detailed insights into the biosynthetic pathway from FPP via pre-sodorifen pyrophosphate to sodorifen."
Comprehending and improving cannabis specialized metabolism in the systems biology era,"Abstract

Cannabis sativa is a source of food, fiber and specialized metabolites such as cannabinoids, with psychoactive and pharmacological effects. Due to its expanding and increasingly-accepted use in medicine, cannabis cultivation is acquiring more importance and less social stigma. Humans initiated different domestication episodes whose later spread gave rise to a plethora of landrace cultivars. At present, breeders cross germplasms from different gene pools depending on their specific use. The fiber (hemp) and drug (marijuana) types of C. sativa differ in their cannabinoid chemical composition phenotype (chemotype) and also in the accumulation of terpenoid compounds that constitute a strain’s particular flavor and scent. Cannabinoids are isoprenylated polyketides among which cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and (-)-trans-??-tetrahydrocannabinol acid (THCA) have been well-documented for their many effects on humans. Here, we review the most studied specialized metabolic pathways in C. sativa, showing how terpenes and cannabinoids share both part of the isoprenoid pathway and the same biosynthetic compartmentalization (i.e. glandular trichomes of leaves and flowers). We enlist the several studies that have deciphered these pathways in this species including physical and genetic maps, QTL analyses and localization and enzymatic studies of cannabinoid and terpene synthases. In addition, new comparative modeling of cannabinoid synthases and phylogenetic trees are presented. We describe the genome sequencing initiatives of several accessions with the concomitant generation of next-generation genome maps and transcriptomic data. Very recently, proteomic characterizations and systems biology approaches such as those applying network theory or the integration of multi-omics data have increased the knowledge on gene function, enzyme diversity and metabolite content in C. sativa. In this revision we drift through the history, present and future of cannabis research and on how second- and third-generation sequencing technologies are bringing light to the field of cannabis specialized metabolism. We also discuss different biotechnological approaches for producing cannabinoids in engineered microorganisms."
"Cytochrome P450s from Cynara cardunculus L. CYP71AV9 and CYP71BL5, catalyze distinct hydroxylations in the sesquiterpene lactone biosynthetic pathway","Abstract

Cynara cardunculus (Asteraceae) is a cross pollinated perennial crop which includes the two cultivated taxa globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon. The leaves of these plants contain high concentrations of sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) among which cynaropicrin is the most represented, and has recently attracted attention because of its therapeutic potential as anti-tumor and anti-photoaging agent. Costunolide is considered the common precursor of the STLs and three enzymes are involved in its biosynthetic pathway: i.e. the germacrene A synthase (GAS), the germacrene A oxidase (GAO) and the costunolide synthase (COS). Here we report on the isolation of two P450 genes, (i.e. CYP71AV9 and CYP71BL5), in a set of ~19,000 C. cardunculus unigenes, and their functional characterization in yeast and in planta. The metabolite analyses revealed that the co-expression of CYP71AV9 together with GAS resulted in the biosynthesis of germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid in yeast. The co-expression of CYP71BL5 and CYP71AV9 with GAS led to biosynthesis of the free costunolide in yeast and costunolide conjugates in Nicotiana benthamiana, demonstrating their involvement in STL biosynthesis as GAO and COS enzymes. The substrate specificity of CYP71AV9 was investigated by testing its ability to convert amorpha-4,11-diene, (+)-germacrene D and cascarilladiene to their oxidized products when co-expressed in yeast with the corresponding terpene synthases."
De novo synthesis of the sedative valerenic acid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Abstract

Valeriana officinalis (Valerian) root extracts have been used by European and Asian cultures for millennia for their anxiolytic and sedative properties. However, the efficacy of these extracts suffers from variable yields and composition, making these extracts a prime candidate for microbial production. Recently, valerenic acid, a C15 sesquiterpenoid, was identified as the active compound that modulates the GABAA channel. Although the first committed step, valerena-4,7(11)-diene synthase, has been identified and described, the complete valerenic acid biosynthetic pathway remains to be elucidated. Sequence homology and tissue-specific expression profiles of V. officinalis putative P450s led to the discovery of a V. officinalis valerena-4,7(11)-diene oxidase, VoCYP71DJ1, which required coexpression with a V. officinalis alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase to complete valerenic acid biosynthesis in yeast. Further, we demonstrated the stable integration of all pathway enzymes in yeast, resulting in the production of 140?mg/L of valerena-4,7(11)-diene and 4?mg/L of valerenic acid in milliliter plates. These findings showcase Saccharomyces cerevisiae's potential as an expression platform for facilitating multiply-oxidized medicinal terpenoid pathway discovery, possibly paving the way for scale up and FDA approval of valerenic acid and other active compounds from plant-derived herbal medicines."
Designing the perfect plant feedstock for biofuel production: Using the whole buffalo to diversify fuels and products,"Abstract

Petroleum-derived liquid fuels and commodities play a part in nearly every aspect of modern daily life. However, dependence on this one natural resource to maintain modern amenities has caused negative environmental and geopolitical ramifications. In an effort to replace petroleum, technologies to synthesize liquid fuels and other commodities from renewable biomass are being developed. Current technologies, however, only use a portion of plant biomass feedstocks for fuel and useful products. ""Using the whole feedstock buffalo"" or optimally using all portions and biochemicals present in renewable biomass will enhance the economic and environmental feasibility of biofuels and coproducts. To accomplish this optimization, greater understanding of the relationship between liquid fuel and bioproduct properties and plant chemistries is needed. Liquid fuel properties and how they relate to biochemistry and petrochemistry are discussed. Enhanced biofuel yields and high-value commodities from biomass are needed to sustainably replace petroleum-based products. Several metabolic engineering strategies are discussed. We will describe paths of possible fuel and product diversification using dedicated lignocellulosic biomass (e.g., switchgrass)."
Developing fermentative terpenoid production for commercial usage,"Terpenoids comprise a large (>55 000) family of compounds, very few of which have been used commercially due to low and economically unpractical production in their native hosts (generally plants and microorganisms). Two examples of natural terpenoid production are described (rubber and astaxanthin), but the advent of metabolic engineering has allowed the development of fermentative production processes using heterologous microorganisms. The two biochemical pathways responsible for terpenoid production are described, along with manipulations that enable production of terpenoids at economically viable levels. Finally, this article reviews some terpenoids that are currently in commercial production or development, ranging from semisynthetic production of the antimalarial drug artemisinin, through fragrance molecules, to commodity chemicals such as isoprene and ß-farnesene."
Differences of aroma development and metabolic pathway gene expression between Kyoho and 87-1 grapes,"Abstract

Aroma is an important quality trait of grapes and often the focus of consumers, viticulturists and grapevine breeders. Kyoho is a hybrid between Vitis vinifera and Vitis labrusca with a strawberry-like scent, while 87-1 is an early-ripening mutant of Muscat hamburg, belonging to Vitis vinifera, with a rose scent. In this study, we compared their aroma compositions and concentrations during berry development by headspace-SPME combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and analyzed the expression differences of enzyme-encoding genes in the LOX-HPL, MEP and MVA metabolic pathways by qRT-PCR. Twelve esters were detected in Kyoho during the whole berry development and they were abundant after veraison, but no esters were detected in 87-1 berries. Linalool was the dominant terpene among the 14 terpenes detected in 87-1 berries, while limited amounts of terpenes were detected in Kyoho berries. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the low expression of VvAAT might explain the low content of ester volatiles in 87-1 berries, and the low expression of coding genes in the MEP pathway, especially VvPNLinNer1, might be the reason for the low content of volatile terpenes in Kyoho berries. The results from this work will promote our understanding of aroma metabolic mechanisms of grapes, and offer some suggestions for grape aromatic quality improvement."
Differential transcriptome analysis of genes associated with the rhizome growth and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in Atractylodes macrocephala,"Abstract

The rhizome of Atractylodes macrocephala is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine containing a variety of sesquiterpenoids and has a wide range of bioactivities. Due to the lack of genetic information, the rhizome growth and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in A. macrocephala are basically unknown. In this study, the metabolic analysis and transcriptome sequencing of five different tissues (rhizomes, roots, stems, leaves and buds) of A. macrocephala were performed. Over 97.08 Gb clean data obtained from fifteen sequencing samples were assembled into 144,137 unigenes. Transcription factor (TF) analysis revealed that 14 TFs predominantly expressed in the rhizomes might be involved in the regulation of rhizome growth and sesquiterpene biosynthesis. A total of 73 unigenes and 287 CYP450s were annotated to sesquiterpene biosynthesis, and AmFPPS was verified to catalyze the biosynthesis of sesquiterpene. EF-1a was the best reference gene for tissue expression pattern analysis in A. macrocephala by comparing the expression of reference genes in five tissues. Thus, extensive transcriptome data from this work offered a comprehensive transcriptional expression pattern in different tissues of A. macrocephala, which will provide a more valuable resource for further research on molecular mechanisms of the growth and development of rhizome, and the biosynthesis and regulation sesquiterpenes."
Direct evidence of specific localization of sesquiterpenes and marchantin A in oil body cells of Marchantia polymorpha L.,"Abstract

Liverworts are a rich source of a diverse array of specialized metabolites, such as terpenoids and benzenoids, which are potentially useful for pharmaceutical or agrochemical applications, and also provide clues to elucidate the strategy by which liverworts adapt to the terrestrial environment. Liverworts, belonging to orders Marchantiales and Jungermanniales, possess oil bodies. In Marchantia polymorpha L., oil bodies are confined to scattered idioblastic oil body cells. It has been assumed that the specialized metabolites in M. polymorpha specifically accumulate in the oil bodies in oil body cells; however, no direct evidence was previously available for this specific accumulation. In this study, direct evidence was obtained using micromanipulation techniques coupled with MS analysis that demonstrated the specific accumulation of sesquiterpenoids and marchantin A in the oil body cells of M. polymorpha thalli. It was also observed that the number of oil body cells increased in thalli grown in low-mineral conditions. The amounts of sesquiterpenoids and marchantin A detected in crude extract prepared from the whole thallus were roughly proportional to the number of oil body cells found in a given volume of thallus, suggesting that oil body cell differentiation and sesquiterpenoid and marchantin A biosynthetic pathways are coordinated with each other."
Discovery and Characterization of Terpenoid Biosynthetic Pathways of Fungi,"Abstract

Fungi produce a myriad of terpenoids with a broad range of biological activities, many of which can be adapted to human use. This requires knowledge of the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of these compounds. Herein, we describe strategies for identification and characterization of putative biosynthetic genes, structural examination of important pathway enzymes with a focus on altering activity, and identification of biosynthetic clusters, and genome mining for yet-to-be-discovered pathways. Fungi are a particularly attractive class of organism for terpenoid pathway discovery, as they often cluster their biosynthetic genes. The affordability of genome sequencing and the relatively small size of fungal genomes further simplify this process. While only a select few fungal strains are genetically tractable, many terpenoid biosynthetic genes are functional in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, allowing easy characterization. Identification of new terpenoid biosynthetic pathways has the potential to uncover new pharmaceutical compounds and establish new strategies for metabolic engineering."
Discovery of germacrene A synthases in Barnadesia spinosa: The first committed step in sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis in the basal member of the Asteraceae,"Abstract

The Andes-endemic Barnadesioideae lineage is the oldest surviving and phylogenetically basal subfamily of the Asteraceae (Compositae), a prolific group of flowering plants with world-wide distribution (~24,000 species) marked by a rich diversity of sesquiterpene lactones (STLs). Intriguingly, there is no evidence that members of the Barnadesioideae produce STLs, specialized metabolites thought to have contributed to the adaptive success of the Asteraceae family outside South America. The biosynthesis of STLs requires the intimate expression and functional integration of germacrene A synthase (GAS) and germacrene A oxidase (GAO) to sequentially cyclize and oxidize farnesyl diphosphate into the advanced intermediate germacrene A acid leading to diverse STLs. Our previous discovery of GAO activity conserved across all major subfamilies of Asteraceae, including the phylogenetically basal lineage of Barnadesioideae, prompted further investigation of the presence of the gateway GAS in Barnadesioideae. Herein we isolated two terpene synthases (BsGAS1/BsGAS2) from the basal Barnadesia spinosa (Barnadesioideae) that displayed robust GAS activity when reconstituted in yeast and characterized in vitro. Despite the apparent lack of STLs in the Barnadesioideae, this work unambiguously confirms the presence of GAS in the basal genera of the Asteraceae. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the two BsGASs fall into two distinct clades of the Asteraceae's GASs, and BsGAS1 clade is only retained in the evolutionary closer Cichorioideae subfamily, implicating BsGAS2 is likely the ancestral base of most GASs found in the lineages outside the Barnadesioideae. Taken together, these results show the enzymatic capacities of GAS and GAO emerged prior to the subsequent radiation of STL-producing Asteraceae subfamilies."
Disproportionate photosynthetic decline and inverse relationship between constitutive and induced volatile emissions upon feeding of Quercus robur leaves by large larvae of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar),"Abstract

Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L., Lymantriinae) is a major pest of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) forests in Europe, but how its infections scale with foliage physiological characteristics, in particular with photosynthesis rates and emissions of volatile organic compounds has not been studied. Differently from the majority of insect herbivores, large larvae of L. dispar rapidly consume leaf area, and can also bite through tough tissues, including secondary and primary leaf veins. Given the rapid and devastating feeding responses, we hypothesized that infection of Q. robur leaves by L. dispar leads to disproportionate scaling of leaf photosynthesis and constitutive isoprene emissions with damaged leaf area, and to less prominent enhancements of induced volatile release. Leaves with 0% (control) to 50% of leaf area removed by larvae were studied. Across this range of infection severity, all physiological characteristics were quantitatively correlated with the degree of damage, but all these traits changed disproportionately with the degree of damage. The net assimilation rate was reduced by almost 10-fold and constitutive isoprene emissions by more than 7-fold, whereas the emissions of green leaf volatiles, monoterpenes, methyl salicylate and the homoterpene (3E)-4,8-dimethy-1,3,7-nonatriene scaled negatively and almost linearly with net assimilation rate through damage treatments. This study demonstrates that feeding by large insect herbivores disproportionately alters photosynthetic rate and constitutive isoprene emissions. Furthermore, the leaves have a surprisingly large capacity for enhancement of induced emissions even when foliage photosynthetic function is severely impaired."
Do future climate conditions change volatile organic compound emissions from Artemisia annua? Elevated CO2 and temperature modulate actual VOC emission rate but not its emission capacity,"Abstract

Increasing temperature and atmospheric [CO2] can change plant VOC emissions, thereby providing a possible feedback to climate change by altering particle and greenhouse gas formation. While evidence gathered on isoprene emission generally indicated an inhibitory effect of elevated CO2 on emission at moderate temperature, it is unclear whether the emissions of other volatiles respond in a similar way. In a greenhouse study, we grew Artemisia annua plants under two [CO2] regimes (400/800 ppm) combined with two temperature regimes (25/15 and 30/20 °C) and determined emissions at two assay [CO2] (400/800 ppm) combined with two assay temperatures (30/37 °C). Foliar VOC concentrations were unaffected by growth conditions and resembled emissions consisting mainly of monoterpenes (>92%) and sesquiterpenes (>7%). Mean emission rates determined at 30 °C and 400 ppm [CO2] ranged between 1.2 and 2.5 µg g-1h-1 (11–26 ng m-2s-1) with lowest values observed for elevated-[CO2]-grown plants. However, this apparent negative effect of growth [CO2] was compensated by increased plant growth. Irrespective of growth conditions, doubling assay [CO2] significantly reduced emissions at 37 °C by about 30% and had no effect at 30 °C. Emissions always increased on the increase in assay temperature, with monoterpenes responding more strongly than sesquiterpenes (mean %-increase of 17.5 and 12.5 °C-1). Our results suggest that the future evolution of VOC release from A. annua depends mainly on the antagonistic emission responses to temperature and [CO2], while long-term acclimations play a minor role."
Drought stress adaptation modulates plant secondary metabolite production in Salvia dolomitica Codd,"Abstract

Sage is an important medicinal and aromatic plant. While Salvia officinalis and S. miltiorrhiza have been widely studied, little information regarding S. dolomitica exists, although it has recently attracted attention due to its anti-plasmodial and anti-inflammatory properties. This study investigated the performance and metabolic profile of this species in response to two drought treatments (moderate or severe) relative to well-watered control plants. Changes in growth and ecophysiological traits, as well as in bioactive and volatile compounds and essential oil production were determined. Given that terpenoids are the most representative class of secondary metabolites, the gene expression of key enzymes of terpenoid biosynthesis was also investigated. Moderate drought stimulated a decline in leaf water potential, growth and stomatal conductance, as well as an increase in deyhdrin expression. Serious stress symptoms occurred only in severe drought-stressed plants, where a decline in net photosynthesis and transpiration and an increase in endogenous abscisic acid was observed. Both drought stress conditions led to modulate the expression of some genes involved in biogenic volatile organic compound and essential oil biosynthesis and metabolic profile. In particular, drought induced an increase in sesquiterpene production, a class of terpenoids that is important in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Thus, controlled drought, in addition to water savings during cultivation, can be applied to improve the production of secondary metabolites in S. dolomitica."
Dynamic control of gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae engineered for the production of plant sesquitepene a-santalene in a fed-batch mode,"Abstract

Microbial cells engineered for efficient production of plant sesquiterpenes may allow for sustainable and scalable production of these compounds that can be used as e.g. perfumes and pharmaceuticals. Here, for the first time a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain capable of producing high levels of a-santalene, the precursor of a commercially interesting compound, was constructed through a rationally designed metabolic engineering approach. Optimal sesquiterpene production was obtained by modulating the expression of one of the key metabolic steps of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, squalene synthase (Erg9). To couple ERG9 expression to glucose concentration its promoter was replaced by the HXT1 promoter. In a second approach, the HXT2 promoter was used to express an ERG9 antisense construct. Using the HXT1 promoter to control ERG9 expression, it was possible to divert the carbon flux from sterol synthesis towards a-santalene improving the productivity by 3.4 fold. Combining this approach together with the overexpression of a truncated form of 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and deletion of lipid phosphate phosphatase encoded by LPP1 led to a strain with a productivity of 0.18 mg/gDCW h. The titer was further increased by deleting DPP1 encoding a second FPP consuming pyrophosphate phosphatase yielding a final productivity and titer, respectively, of 0.21 mg/gDCW h and 92 mg/l of a-santalene."
Dynamic pathway allocation in early terpenoid biosynthesis of stress-induced lima bean leaves,"Abstract

Two independent pathways contribute in higher plants to the formation of isopenteny1 diphosphate (IDP), the central building block of isoprenoids. In general, the cytosolic mevalonate pathway (MVA) provides the precursors for sesquiterpenes and sterols, whereas the plastidial methylerythritol pathway (MEP) furnishes the monoterpene-, diterpene- and carotenoids. Administration of deuterium labeled 1-deoxy-d-xylulose and mevalolactone to lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus), followed by gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric analysis of de novo produced volatiles revealed that the strict separation of both pathways does not exist. This could be confirmed by blocking the pathways individually with cerivastatin® (MVA) and fosmidomycin (MEP), respectively. Isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) at natural abundance levels demonstrated independently and without the need for labeled precursors a dynamic allocation of the MVA- or the MEP-pathway in the biosynthesis of the nerolidol-derived homoterpene 4,8-dimethy1-nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT). Insect-feeding upregulated predominantly the MVA-pathway, while the fungal elicitor alamethicin stimulated the biosynthesis of DMNT via the MEP-pathway."
Early transcriptional response of terpenoid metabolism to Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in a resistant wild strawberry Fragaria nilgerrensis,"Abstract

Modern strawberry production is often threatened by microbe pathogens. Anthracnose is among the most prominent fungal disease caused mainly by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and leads to large-scale losses both in quality and yield. Little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying the genetics in the strawberry-C. gloeosporioides interaction. In the current research, a wild accession ‘Fragaria nilgerrensis’ is used as a resistant model to study the roles of terpenoid and terpene genes in leaf response to C. gloeosporioides. We found that several terpenoids and terpene genes were up-regulated at early time points after challenged with C. gloeosporioides. Among the metabolites detected, sesquiterpenes were the most significantly accumulated compounds, increasing up to ~12-fold at 18 h post infection (hpi), followed by monoterpenes which showed a slight increase upon infection. Consistently, the time-resolved transcriptome data revealed that genes pertaining to terpenoid metabolism were rapidly up-regulated and co-expressed with signaling pathway genes relevant to defense response. Notably, quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that the expression of five terpene synthase genes (TPS) were greatly enhanced, by a factor of one to three orders of magnitude at 3–6 hpi. Our results reveal a possible link between rapidly induced terpenoid metabolism and the autoimmunity underlying anthracnose resistance in a wild strawberry species."
Effects of elevated ozone on the emission of volatile isoprenoids from flowers and leaves of rose (Rosa sp.) varieties,"Abstract

Tropospheric ozone (O3) affects isoprenoid emissions, and floral emissions in particular, which may result in potential impacts on the interactions of plants with other organisms. The effects of ozone (O3) on isoprenoid emissions have been investigated for many years, while knowledge on O3 effects on floral emissions is still scarce and the relevant mechanism has not been clarified so far. We investigated the effects of O3 on floral and foliar isoprenoid emissions (mainly isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) and their synthase substrates from three rose varieties (CH, Rosa chinensis Jacq. var. chinensis; SA, R. hybrida ‘Saiun’; MO, R. hybrida ‘Monica Bellucci’) at different exposure durations. Results indicated that the O3-induced stimulation after short-term exposure (35 days after the beginning of O3 exposure) was significant only for sesquiterpene emissions from flowers, while long-term O3 exposure (90 days after the beginning of O3 exposure) significantly decreased both foliar and floral monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions. In addition, the observed decline of emissions under long-term O3 exposure resulted from the limitation of synthase substrates, and the responses of emissions and substrates varied among varieties, with the greatest variation in the O3-sensitive variety. These findings provide important insights on plant isoprenoid emissions and species selection for landscaping, especially in areas with high O3 concentration."
Effects of Mirazid® and myrrh volatile oil on adult Fasciola gigantica under laboratory conditions,"Abstract
Objective

To evaluate the effects of Mirazid® and myrrh volatile oil on adult Fasciola gigantica (F. gigantica) under laboratory conditions.

Methods

The effects of oleoresin extract of myrrh (Mirazid®) and myrrh volatile oil on the surface morphology of adult F. gigantica following treatment in vitro had been determined by scanning electron microscopy. The results were compared with those observed in the fluke tegument following incubation in triclabendazole sulphoxide (TCBZ-SO), active form, (Fasinex®, Ciba-Geigy).

Results

Observations of the efficacy of Mirazid® oleoresin extract and myrrh volatile oil indicated that both products showed dose-dependent anthelmintic efficacy. The anterior half of the fluke was consistently more severely affected than the posterior half. The surface changes induced by Mirazid® oleoresin extract were less severe than those observed after exposure to either myrrh volatile oil or TCBZ-SO. Flukes showed swelling after these treatments, but its level and blebbing were much greater with myrrh volatile oil; in which patches of tegumental sloughing were observed in the apical cone and the posterior mid-body region of flukes. This was not observed after treatment with Mirazid® oleoresin extract.

Conclusions

The comparatively more disruption, observed in myrrh volatile oil exposed specimens, compared to that exposed to Mirazid® oleoresin extract might suggest that the anthelmintic activity of Mirazid® oleo resin extract was attributed to its content of volatile oil. So, increasing the concentration of myrrh volatile oil in Mirazid® might possibly help to developing its anthelmintic activity."
Efficient diterpene production in yeast by engineering Erg20p into a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase,"Abstract

Terpenes have numerous applications, ranging from pharmaceuticals to fragrances and biofuels. With increasing interest in producing terpenes sustainably and economically, there has been significant progress in recent years in developing methods for their production in microorganisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, production of the 20-carbon diterpenes has so far proven to be significantly less efficient than production of their 15-carbon sesquiterpene counterparts. In this report, we identify the modular structure of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthesis in yeast to be a major limitation in diterpene yields, and we engineer the yeast farnesyl diphosphate synthase Erg20p to produce geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Using a combination of protein and genetic engineering, we achieve significant improvements in the production of sclareol and several other isoprenoids, including cis-abienol, abietadiene and ß-carotene. We also report the development of yeast strains carrying the engineered Erg20p, which support efficient isoprenoid production and can be used as a dedicated chassis for diterpene production or biosynthetic pathway elucidation. The design developed here can be applied to the production of any GGPP-derived isoprenoid and is compatible with other yeast terpene production platforms."
Efficient phototrophic production of a high-value sesquiterpenoid from the eukaryotic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"Abstract

The heterologous expression of terpene synthases in microbial hosts has opened numerous possibilities for bioproduction of desirable metabolites. Photosynthetic microbial hosts present a sustainable alternative to traditional fermentative systems, using freely available (sun)light and carbon dioxide as inputs for bio-production. Here, we report the expression of a patchoulol synthase from Pogostemon cablin Benth in the model green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The sesquiterpenoid patchoulol was produced from the alga and was used as a marker of sesquiterpenoid production capacity. A novel strategy for gene loading was employed and patchoulol was produced up to 922±242 µg g-1 CDW in six days. We additionally investigated the effect of carbon source on sesquiterpenoid productivity from C. reinhardtii in scale-up batch cultivations. It was determined that up to 1.03 mg L-1 sesquiterpenoid products could be produced in completely photoautotrophic conditions and that the alga exhibited altered sesquiterpenoid production metabolism related to carbon source."
"Enantiospecific (+)- and (-)-germacrene D synthases, cloned from goldenrod, reveal a functionally active variant of the universal isoprenoid-biosynthesis aspartate-rich motif","Abstract

The naturally occurring, volatile sesquiterpene hydrocarbon germacrene D has strong effects on insect behaviour and genes encoding enzymes that produce this compound are of interest in the study of plant–insect interactions and in a number of biotechnological approaches to pest control. Goldenrod, Solidago canadensis, is unusual in that it produces both enantiomers of germacrene D. Two new sesquiterpene synthase cDNAs, designated Sc11 and Sc19, have been isolated from goldenrod and functional expression in Escherichia coli identified Sc11 as (+)-germacrene D synthase and Sc19 as (-)-germacrene D synthase. Thus, the enantiomers of germacrene D are the products of separate, but closely related (85% amino-acid identity), enzymes. Unlike other sesquiterpene synthases and the related monoterpene synthases and prenyl transferases, which contain the characteristic amino-acid motif DDXX(D, E), Sc11 is unusual in that this motif occurs as 303NDTYD. Mutagenesis of this motif to 303DDTYD gave rise to an enzyme that fully retained (+)-germacrene D synthase activity. The converse mutation in Sc19 (D303N) resulted in a less efficient but functional enzyme. Mutagenesis of position 303 to glutamate in both enzymes resulted in loss of activity. These results indicate that the magnesium ion-binding role of the first aspartate in the DDXXD motif may not be as critical as previously thought. Further amino-acid sequence comparisons and molecular modelling of the enzyme structures revealed that very subtle changes to the active site of this family of enzymes are required to alter the reaction pathway to form, in this case, different enantiomers from the same enzyme-bound carbocationic intermediate."
Engineered protein degradation of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase is an effective regulatory mechanism to increase monoterpene production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Abstract

Monoterpene production in Saccharomyces cerevisae requires the introduction of heterologous monoterpene synthases (MTSs). The endogenous farnesyl pyrosphosphate synthase (FPPS; Erg20p) competes with MTSs for the precursor geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), which limits the production of monoterpenes. ERG20 is an essential gene that cannot be deleted and transcriptional down-regulation of ERG20 has failed to improve monoterpene production. Here, we investigated an N-degron-dependent protein degradation strategy to down-regulate Erg20p activity. Degron tagging decreased GFP protein half-life drastically to 1?h (degron K3K15) or 15?min (degrons KN113 and KN119). Degron tagging of ERG20 was therefore paired with a sterol responsive promoter to ensure sufficient metabolic flux to essential downstream sterols despite the severe destabilisation effect of degron tagging. A dual monoterpene/sesquiterpene (linalool/nerolidol) synthase, AcNES1, was used as a reporter of intracellular GPP and FPP production. Transcription of the synthetic pathway was controlled by either constitutive or diauxie-inducible promoters. A combination of degron K3K15 and the ERG1 promoter increased linalool titre by 27-fold to 11?mg?L-1 in the strain with constitutive promoter constructs, and by 17-fold to 18?mg?L-1 in the strain with diauxie-inducible promoter constructs. The sesquiterpene nerolidol remained the major product in both strains. The same strategies were applied to construct a limonene-producing strain, which produced 76?mg?L-1 in batch cultivation. The FPPS regulation method developed here successfully redirected metabolic flux toward monoterpene production. Examination of growth defects in various strains suggested that the intracellular FPP concentration had a significant effect on growth rate. Further strategies are required to balance intracellular production of FPP and GPP so as to maximise monoterpene production without impacting on cellular growth."
Engineering metabolic pathways in Amycolatopsis japonicum for the optimization of the precursor supply for heterologous brasilicardin congeners production,"Abstract

The isoprenoid brasilicardin A is a promising immunosuppressant compound with a unique mode of action, high potency and reduced toxicity compared to today's standard drugs. However, production of brasilicardin has been hampered since the producer strain Nocardia terpenica IFM0406 synthesizes brasilicardin in only low amounts and is a biosafety level 2 organism. Previously, we were able to heterologously express the brasilicardin gene cluster in the nocardioform actinomycete Amycolatopsis japonicum. Four brasilicardin congeners, intermediates of the BraA biosynthesis, were produced. Since chemical synthesis of the brasilicardin core structure has remained elusive we intended to produce high amounts of the brasilicardin backbone for semi synthesis and derivatization. Therefore, we used a metabolic engineering approach to increase heterologous production of brasilicardin in A. japonicum. Simultaneous heterologous expression of genes encoding the MVA pathway and expression of diterpenoid specific prenyltransferases were used to increase the provision of the isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and to channel the precursor into the direction of diterpenoid biosynthesis. Both approaches contributed to an elevated heterologous production of the brasilicardin backbone, which can now be used as a starting point for semi synthesis of new brasilicardin congeners with better properties."
Engineering of Tomato Glandular Trichomes for the Production of Specialized Metabolites,"Abstract

Glandular trichomes are specialized tissues on the epidermis of many plant species. On tomato they synthesize, store, and emit a variety of metabolites such as terpenoids, which play a role in the interaction with insects. Glandular trichomes are excellent tissues for studying the biosynthesis of specialized plant metabolites and are especially suitable targets for metabolic engineering. Here we describe the strategy for engineering tomato glandular trichomes, first with a transient expression system to provide proof of trichome specificity of selected promoters. Using microparticle bombardment, the trichome specificity of a terpene-synthase promoter could be validated in a relatively fast way. Second, we describe a method for stable expression of genes of interest in trichomes. Trichome-specific expression of another terpene-synthase promoter driving the yellow-fluorescence protein-gene is presented. Finally, we describe a case of the overexpression of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS), specifically in tomato glandular trichomes, providing an important precursor in the biosynthetic pathway of sesquiterpenoids. FPS was targeted to the plastid aiming to engineer sesquiterpenoid production, but interestingly leading to a loss of monoterpenoid production in the transgenic tomato trichomes. With this example we show that trichomes are amenable to engineering though, even with knowledge of a biochemical pathway, the result of such engineering can be unexpected."
"Engineering the biosynthesis of low molecular weight metabolites for quality traits (essential nutrients, health-promoting phytochemicals, volatiles, and aroma compounds)","Publisher Summary

Primary metabolites as essential nutrients are being more intensively studied and their engineering has often been reviewed. Low molecular weight metabolites are important components of crop plants for both consumers and producers. Thus, this chapter first outlines the metabolic engineering of essential nutrients, such as essential amino acids, lipids, vitamins, and minerals, and then summarizes the recent advances in the modification of a more specific secondary metabolism for the improvement of quality traits. Essential amino acid biosynthesis is strictly regulated by some key enzymes, such as dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) in lysine (Lys) biosynthesis and anthranilate synthase in tryptophan (Trp) synthesis. Folate has received considerable attention, since its deficiency induces neural tube defects during early pregnancy. Fatty acids are another target for nutritional improvement because some of them are critical in metabolism, cardiovascular health, inflammatory responses, and blood pressure regulation."
Engineering the plant rhizosphere,"Plant natural products are low molecular weight compounds playing important roles in plant survival under biotic and abiotic stresses. In the rhizosphere, several groups of plant natural products function as semiochemicals that mediate the interactions of plants with other plants, animals and microorganisms. The knowledge on the biosynthesis and transport of these signaling molecules is increasing fast. This enables us to consider to optimize plant performance by changing the production of these signaling molecules or their exudation into the rhizosphere. Here we discuss recent advances in the understanding and metabolic engineering of these rhizosphere semiochemicals."
Essential oil constituents derived from different organs of a relictual conifer Wollemia nobilis,"Abstract

The chemical composition of the essential oil of leaves (0.9%, w/v) and twigs (0.33%, w/v) of Wollemia nobilis (Araucariaceae) – a remnant species thought to have been extinct for 65 million years – was investigated by GC/MS. The main constituents of both leaf- and twig-derived oil samples were 16-kaurene (61.8% and 38.2%, respectively) and germacrene D (9.9% and 22%). The principal difference was a considerably more pronounced sesquiterpene presence in the twig-oil, amounting to 33.5%, than in its folial counterpart (23.4%). On the contrary, while remaining the dominant group in both oil samples under investigation, diterpenoids were relatively more abundant in leaf-derived oil constituting 65.3%, versus 41.7% detected in twigs. To our knowledge, this is the first report dealing with the essential oil composition of Wollemi pine twigs, as opposed to the leaf-derived volatiles."
Essential oils from New Zealand manuka: triketone and other chemotypes of Leptospermum scoparium,"Abstract

The triketone chemotype of manuka, Leptospermum scoparium (Myrtaceae), is commercially important because of its antimicrobial activity. Oils from 36 individual plants on the East Cape of New Zealand all showed similar high triketone contents (>20% total triketones) with little seasonal variation. Analyses of oils from 261 individual manuka plants collected from 87 sites throughout New Zealand showed that the high triketone chemotype was localised on the East Cape, although oils with triketone levels up to 20% were found in the Marlborough Sounds area of the South Island. Cluster analysis revealed other chemotypes localised on other areas. Ten further chemotypes are described: a-pinene; sesquiterpene-rich with high myrcene; sesquiterpene-rich with elevated caryophyllene and humulene; sesquiterpene-rich with an unidentified sesquiterpene hydrocarbon; high geranyl acetate; sesquiterpene-rich with high ?-ylangene + a-copaene and elevated triketones; sesquiterpene-rich with no distinctive components; sesquiterpene-rich with high trans-methyl cinnamate; high linalol; and sesquiterpene-rich with elevated elemene and selinene. Some of the chemotypes contained aroma compounds at relatively high levels, with a geranyl acetate-rich oil being most notable. Possible origins for this complex array of chemotypes are proposed."
Eucalypt smoke and wildfires: Temperature dependent emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds,"Abstract

Eucalypt contributions to biogenic sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Australia are estimated at teragram (Tg = 1012 g) amounts each year. Biogenic VOCs include plant-specific isoprenoids (isoprene and a range of terpenes) and other reactive organic compounds (i.e., acids, aldehydes and ketones). Atmospheric reactions of VOCs are numerous and many have significant environmental impact. Wildfires increase both the amounts of VOCs released and the complexity of their reactions. Proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and direct analysis in real time (DART) mass spectrometry were applied to analyze release of VOCs as a function of temperatures ranging from ambient to combustion. PTR-MS enabled trace level analysis of VOCs from a complex forest atmosphere and revealed the release of terpenes associated with leaf damage during a storm. Temperature profile studies revealed ion abundances (i.e., emissions of VOCs) could be correlated with boiling points and vapor pressures of specific compounds. PTR-MS analysis of VOCs resulting from heating fresh leaf (E. grandis) material suggested that emissions of protonated methanol (m/z 33) and protonated acetaldehyde (m/z 45) were greatest at ~60 °C while m/z 137 and 153 (associated with a series of terpenes) showed monotonic increases in ion abundance over a wide temperature range from ambient to 200 °C. GCMS analysis of fresh and senescent leaves of E. grandis showed that a series of VOCs (ethylvinylketone, diethylketone, 2-ethylfuran, hexanal and hexenals) are present only in fresh leaves while several terpenes (a and ß pinenes, a-phellandrene, eucalyptol, ?-terpinene) were common in both. DART analysis of fresh leaf and stem of E. sideroxylon identified tissue-specific VOCs (e.g., methanol and ethanol were more abundant in stems). PTR-MS combustion studies of senescent leaves (E. grandis) identified two distinct, temperature-dependent VOC compositions. Before the appearance of smoke, the composition of VOCs remained consistent and correlated well with various naturally occurring isoprenoids, as observed in temperature profile studies. Sampling of eucalypt smoke suggested ions (m/z 75, 85, 87, 99, 111 and 125) correlated with protonated mass of oxygenated aldehydes, ketones, furans and substituted benzenes, and were due to pyrolysis of polycarbohydrates (cellulose and lignin) that are common in many types of wood."
Evolution of isoprene emission capacity in plants,"Light-dependent de novo volatile isoprene emission by terrestrial plants (approximately 2% of carbon fixed during photosynthesis) contributes as much as 0.5 Pg C/year to the global carbon cycle. Although most plant taxa exhibit either constitutive or inducible monoterpene emissions, the evolution of isoprene emission capacity in multiple lineages has remained unexplained. Based on the predominant occurrence of isoprene emission capacity in long-lived, fast-growing woody plants; the relationship between ‘metabolic scope’ of tree genera and their species richness; and the proposed role of high growth rates and long generation times in accelerating molecular evolution, we hypothesise that long-lived plant genera with inherently high speciation rates have repeatedly acquired and lost the capacity to emit isoprene in their evolutionary history."
Evolution of root-specific carotenoid precursor pathways for apocarotenoid signal biogenesis,"Abstract

Various cleavage products of C40 carotenoid substrates are formed preferentially or exclusively in roots. Such apocarotenoid signaling or regulatory compounds differentially induced in roots during environmental stress responses including root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi include ABA, strigolactones and C13 a-ionol/C14 mycorradicin derivatives. The low carotenoid levels in roots raise the question of whether there is a regulated precursor supply channeled into apocarotenoid formation distinct from default carotenoid pathways. This review describes root-specific isogene components of carotenoid pathways toward apocarotenoid formation, highlighting a new PSY3 class of phytoene synthase genes in dicots. It is clearly distinct from the monocot PSY3 class co-regulated with ABA formation. At least two members of the exclusive dicot PSY3s are regulated by nutrient stress and mycorrhization. This newly recognized dicot PSY3 (dPSY3 vs. mPSY3 from monocots) class probably represents an ancestral branch in the evolution of the plant phytoene synthase family. The evolutionary history of PSY genes is compared with the evolution of MEP pathway isogenes encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthases (DXS), particularly DXS2, which is co-regulated with dPSY3s in mycorrhizal roots. Such stress-inducible isoforms for rate-limiting steps in root carotenogenesis might be components of multi-enzyme complexes committed to apocarotenoid rather than to carotenoid formation."
Expression profiling of various genes during the fruit development and ripening of mango,"Abstract

Mango (Mangifera indica L. cv. Alphonso) development and ripening are the programmed processes; conventional indices and volatile markers help to determine agronomically important stages of fruit life (fruit-setting, harvesting maturity and ripening climacteric). However, more and precise markers are required to understand this programming; apparently, fruit's transcriptome can be a good source of such markers. Therefore, we isolated 18 genes related to the physiology and biochemistry of the fruit and profiled their expression in developing and ripening fruits, flowers and leaves of mango using relative quantitation PCR. In most of the tissues, genes related to primary metabolism, abiotic stress, ethylene response and protein turnover showed high expression as compared to that of the genes related to flavor production. Metallothionin and/or ethylene-response transcription factor showed highest level of transcript abundance in all the tissues. Expressions of mono- and sesquiterpene synthases and 14–3–3 lowered during ripening; whereas, that of lipoxygenase, ethylene-response factor and ubiquitin-protein ligase increased during ripening. Based on these expression profiles, flower showed better positive correlation with developing and ripening fruits than leaf. Most of the genes showed their least expression on the second day of harvest, suggesting that harvesting signals significantly affect the fruit metabolism. Important stages in the fruit life were clearly indicated by the significant changes in the expression levels of various genes. These indications complemented those from the previous analyses of fruit development, ripening and volatile emission, revealing the harmony between physiological, biochemical and molecular activities of the fruit."
Five TPSs are responsible for volatile terpenoid biosynthesis in Albizia julibrissin,"Abstract

Silk tree, Albizia julibrissin Duraz, is an old ornamental plant and extensively cultivated in Asia. Previous works have discovered that the terpenoids were the dominating compounds in the floral VOC of A. julibrissin, however the biosynthesis of these terpenoids was poorly understood so far. Here, 11 terpene synthase genes (TPSs) were identified by transcriptome sequencing that fell into TPS-a, TPS-b and TPS-g subfamilies. The enzymatic activity tests showed that five genes were functional: AjTPS2 was a sesquiterpene synthase and produced a-farnesene and (Z, E)-ß-farnesene; AjTPS5 was able to catalyze the formation of five monoterpenes and nine sesquiterpenes; AjTPS7, AjTPS9 and AjTPS10 were dedicated monoterpene synthases, as AjTPS7 and AjTPS10 formed the single product ß-ocimene and linalool, respectively, and AjTPS9 produced ?-terpinene with other three monoterpenes. More importantly, the main catalytic products of the characterized AjTPSs were consistent with the terpenoids observed in A. julibrissin volatiles. Combining terpene chemistry, TPSs biochemical activities and gene expression analysis, we demonstrate that AjTPS2, AjTPS5, AjTPS7, AjTPS9 and AjTPS10 are responsible for the volatile terpenoids biosynthesis in A. julibrissin."
Floral scent: Regulation and role of MYB transcription factors,"Abstract

Floral scent plays a vital role in reproduction, including attracting pollinators to ensure that fertilization occurs in several plants. In addition, floral scents are widely applied in perfumes, flavors, cosmetics and medicinal substances. Floral scents mediate ecological interactions and have a primary function of attracting visitors and pollinators. Due to the importance of floral scents in plant biology, basic research on flora scent through breeding technology or applications of biotechnology in is still needed. In plants, floral volatile organic compounds (VOC) are categorized into terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids and fatty acid derivatives. Several transcription factors are involved in secondary metabolite pathways, including floral scents. Transcriptional regulation of these biosynthesis pathways involves V-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) protein transcription factors, which play a prominent role in flowers. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of floral scent biosynthesis. Thus far, the engineering of the metabolic pathways responsible for producing floral scents has mainly focused on the final steps of volatile compound generation. In this review, we summarize recent research on the importance and emission of floral scents and emphasize the role of the identified MYB transcription factors in regulating floral volatile metabolism."
Four terpene synthases produce major compounds of the gypsy moth feeding-induced volatile blend of Populus trichocarpa,"Abstract

After herbivore damage, many plants increase their emission of volatile compounds, with terpenes usually comprising the major group of induced volatiles. Populus trichocarpa is the first woody species with a fully sequenced genome, enabling rapid molecular approaches towards characterization of volatile terpene biosynthesis in this and other poplar species. We identified and characterized four terpene synthases (PtTPS1–4) from P. trichocarpa which form major terpene compounds of the volatile blend induced by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) feeding. The enzymes were heterologously expressed and assayed with potential prenyl diphosphate substrates. PtTPS1 and PtTPS2 accepted only farnesyl diphosphate and produced (-)-germacrene D and (E,E)-a-farnesene as their major products, respectively. In contrast, PtTPS3 and PtTPS4 showed both mono- and sesquiterpene synthase activity. They produce the acyclic terpene alcohols linalool and nerolidol but exhibited opposite stereospecificity. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of the respective terpene synthase genes was induced after feeding of gypsy moth caterpillars. The TPS enzyme products may play important roles in indirect defense of poplar to herbivores and in mediating intra- and inter-plant signaling."
Molecular regulation of santalol biosynthesis in Santalum album L.,"Abstract

Santalum album L. commonly known as East-Indian sandal or chandan is a hemiparasitic tree of family santalaceae. Santalol is a bioprospecting molecule present in sandalwood and any effort towards metabolic engineering of this important moiety would require knowledge on gene regulation. Santalol is a sesquiterpene synthesized through mevalonate or non-mevalonate pathways. First step of santalol biosynthesis involves head to tail condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) with its allylic co-substrate dimethyl allyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) to produce geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP; C10 — a monoterpene). GPP upon one additional condensation with IPP produces farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP; C15 — an open chain sesquiterpene). Both the reactions are catalyzed by farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDS). Santalene synthase (SS), a terpene cyclase catalyzes cyclization of open ring FPP into a mixture of cyclic sesquiterpenes such as a-santalene, epi-ß-santalene, ß-santalene and exo bergamotene, the main constituents of sandal oil. The objective of the present work was to generate a comprehensive knowledge on the genes involved in santalol production and study their molecular regulation. To achieve this, sequences encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase and santalene synthase were isolated from sandalwood using suppression subtraction hybridization and 2D gel electrophoresis technology. Functional characterization of both the genes was done through enzyme assays and tissue-specific expression of both the genes was studied. To our knowledge, this is the first report on studies on molecular regulation, and tissue-specific expression of the genes involved in santalol biosynthesis."
Mono- and sesquiterpene release from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaves upon mild and severe heat stress and through recovery: From gene expression to emission responses,"Abstract

Plants frequently experience heat ramps of various severities, but how and to what degree plant metabolic activity recovers from mild and severe heat stress is poorly understood. In this study, we exposed the constitutive terpene emitter, Solanum. lycopersicum leaves to mild (37 and 41 °C), moderate (46 °C) and severe (49 °C) heat ramps of 5 min and monitored foliage photosynthetic activity, lipoxygenase pathway volatile (LOX), and mono- and sesquiterpene emissions and expression of two terpene synthase genes, ß-phellandrene synthase and (E)-ß-caryophyllene/a-humulene synthase, through a 24 h recovery period upon return to pre-stress conditions. Leaf monoterpene emissions were dominated by ß-phellandrene and sesquiterpene emissions by (E)-ß-caryophyllene, and thus, these two terpene synthase genes were representative for the two volatile terpene classes. Photosynthetic characteristics partly recovered under moderate heat stress, and very limited recovery was observed under severe stress. All stress treatments resulted in elicitation of LOX emissions that declined during recovery. Enhanced mono- and sesquiterpene emissions were observed immediately after the heat treatment, but the emissions decreased even to below the control treatment during recovery between 2 and 10 h, and raised again by 24 h. The expression of ß-phellandrene and (E)-ß-caryophyllene synthase genes decreased between 2 and 10 h after heat stress, and recovered to pre-stress level in mild heat stress treatment by 24 h. Overall, this study demonstrates a highly sensitive heat response of terpenoid synthesis that is mainly controlled by gene level responses under mild stress, while severe stress leads to non-recoverable declines in foliage physiological and gene expression activities."
Monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases and the origin of terpene skeletal diversity in plants,"Abstract

The multitude of terpene carbon skeletons in plants is formed by enzymes known as terpene synthases. This review covers the monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases presenting an up-to-date list of enzymes reported and evidence for their ability to form multiple products. The reaction mechanisms of these enzyme classes are described, and information on how terpene synthase proteins mediate catalysis is summarized. Correlations between specific amino acid motifs and terpene synthase function are described, including an analysis of the relationships between active site sequence and cyclization type and a discussion of whether specific protein features might facilitate multiple product formation."
More is better: the diversity of terpene metabolism in plants,"All plants synthesize a diverse array of terpenoid metabolites. Some are common to all, but many are synthesized only in specific taxa and presumably evolved as adaptations to specific ecological conditions. While the basic terpenoid biosynthetic pathways are common in all plants, recent discoveries have revealed many variations in the way plants synthesized specific terpenes. A major theme is the much greater number of substrates that can be used by enzymes belonging to the terpene synthase (TPS) family. Other recent discoveries include non-TPS enzymes that catalyze the formation of terpenes, and novel transport mechanisms."
MTPSLs: New Terpene Synthases in Nonseed Plants,Terpenes constitute a large class of plant secondary metabolites. It was once presumed that these compounds are biosynthesized by typical plant terpene synthases in all land plants. This view has changed with the identification of a new group of terpene synthase genes called MTPSLs for microbial terpene synthase-like genes. MTPSLs are structurally and phylogenetically more related to bacterial and fungal terpene synthases than to typical plant terpene synthases. They are widely distributed in nonseed plants but absent in seed plants and green algae. Much of the terpene diversity in nonseed plants is presumed to be determined by MTPSLs. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that ancestral MTPSL genes were acquired by early land plants from bacteria and fungi through horizontal gene transfer.
My Way: Noncanonical Biosynthesis Pathways for Plant Volatiles,"Plant volatiles are crucial for various interactions with other organisms and their surrounding environment. A large number of these volatiles belong to the terpenoid and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid classes, which have long been considered to be exclusively synthesized from a few canonical pathways. However, several alternative pathways producing these plant volatiles have been discovered recently. This review summarizes the current knowledge about new pathways for these two major groups of plant volatiles, which open new perspectives for applications in metabolic engineering."
Nerolidol production in agroinfiltrated tobacco: Impact of protein stability and membrane targeting of strawberry (Fragraria ananassa) NEROLIDOL SYNTHASE1,"Abstract

The sesquiterpene alcohol nerolidol, synthesized from farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), mediates plant-insect interactions across multiple trophic levels with major implications for pest management in agriculture. We compared nerolidol engineering strategies in tobacco using agroinfiltration to transiently express strawberry (Fragraria ananassa) linalool/nerolidol synthase (FaNES1) either at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or in the cytosol as a soluble protein. Using solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME-GCMS), we have determined that FaNES1 directed to the ER via fusion to the transmembrane domain of squalene synthase or hydroxymethylglutaryl – CoA reductase displayed significant improvements in terms of transcript levels, protein accumulation, and volatile production when compared to its cytosolic form. However, the highest levels of nerolidol production were observed when FaNES1 was fused to GFP and expressed in the cytosol. This SPME-GCMS method afforded a limit of detection and quantification of 1.54 and 5.13?pg, respectively. Nerolidol production levels, which ranged from 0.5 to 3.0?µg/g F.W., correlated more strongly to the accumulation of recombinant protein than transcript level, the former being highest in FaNES-GFP transfected plants. These results indicate that while the ER may represent an enriched source of FDP that can be exploited in metabolic engineering, protein accumulation is a better predictor of sesquiterpene production."
New frontiers: harnessing pivotal advances in microbial engineering for the biosynthesis of plant-derived terpenoids,"Terpenoids are a vast and diverse class of molecules with industrial and medicinal importance. The majority of these molecules are produced across kingdom Plantae via specialized metabolism. Microorganisms, mainly Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have become choice platforms for the biosynthesis of terpenoids due to recent advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. New techniques for gene discovery have expanded our search space for novel terpene synthesis pathways and unlocked unrealized potential for the microbial production of more complex derivatives. Additionally, numerous advances in host and pathway engineering have allowed for the production of terpenoids requiring oxidation and glycosylation, effectively expanding the potential target space. These advances will lay the foundation for the microbial biosynthesis of a seemingly infinite domain of terpenoids with varying applications."
New Light for Phytochemicals,"Light-emitting diode (LED) lighting technology with narrow-bandwidth illumination helps to reduce energy consumption on covered crops. Here, we discuss how this new technology, which provides flexible modification of light spectra, will open new avenues for natural modulation of medicinal and crop plant metabolomes for better colour, flavour, fragrance, and antioxidant properties."
New microbial fuels: a biotech perspective,"Bioethanol and plant oil-derived biodiesel are generally considered first generation biofuels. Recognizing their apparent disadvantages, scientists and engineers are developing more sustainable and economically feasible second generation biofuels. The new microbial fuels summarized here have great potential to become viable replacements or at least supplements of petroleum-derived liquid transportation fuels. Yields and efficiencies of the four metabolic pathways leading to these microbial fuels — mostly designed and optimized in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using modern tools of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology — and the robustness of the biocatalysts that convert the metabolic intermediates to, in some cases, finished and engine-ready fuels, will determine if they can be commercially successful and contribute to alleviating our dependence on fossil fuels."
Nonradioactive Assay for Cellular Dimethylallyl Diphosphate,"Abstract

A sensitive, nonradioactive method was developed to measure cellular levels of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), a central intermediate of isoprenoid metabolism in nature. The assay is based on the hydrolysis of DMAPP in acid to the volatile hydrocarbon isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), with subsequent analysis of isoprene by headspace gas chromatography with reduction gas detection. In the assay, cell samples are directly acidified with 4 M H2SO4 in sealed reaction vials. Therefore, there is no need to extract metabolites, purify them, and keep them stable prior to analysis, and degradative enzymatic activities are destroyed. DMAPP levels of 23 ± 4 nmol (g fresh weight)-1 [ca. 85 nmol (g dry weight)-1] and 80 ± 14 nmol (g fresh weight)-1 [ca. 296 nmol (g dry weight)-1] were measured in dark- and light-adapted leaves of Populus deltoides (Eastern cottonwood), respectively. Evidence is presented to show that DMAPP is the major leaf metabolite giving rise to isoprene following acid hydrolysis. DMAPP levels in Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were determined to be 40.8 ± 16.7 pmol (OD600)-1 [ca. 638 pmol (mg dry weight)-1] and 6.3 ± 3.7 pmol (OD600)-1 [ca. 139 pmol (mg dry weight)-1], respectively. The method should be suitable for any cell or tissue type and isolated cellular organelles."
Nonradioactive assay for detecting isoprenyl diphosphate synthase activity in crude plant extracts using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry,"Abstract

Terpenoids form the largest class of plant metabolites involved in primary and secondary metabolism. Isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs) catalyze the condensation of the C5 terpenoid building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, to form geranyl diphosphate (C10), farnesyl diphosphate (C15), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C20). These branch point reactions control the flow of metabolites that act as precursors to each of the major terpene classes—monoterpenes, sequiterpenes, and diterpenes, respectively. Thus accurate and easily performed assays of IDS enzyme activity are critical to increase our knowledge about the regulation of terpene biosynthesis. Here we describe a new and sensitive nonradioactive method for carrying out IDS assays using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to detect the short-chain prenyl diphosphate products directly without dephosphorylation. Furthermore, we were able to separate cisoid and transoid isomers of both C10 enzyme products (geranyl diphosphate and neryl diphosphate) and three C15 products [(E,E)-, (Z,E)-, and (Z,Z)-farnesyl diphosphate]. By applying the method to crude protein extracts from various organs of Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana attenuata, Populus trichocarpa, and Picea abies, we could determine their IDS activity in a reproducible fashion."
Novel Strategies and Platforms for Industrial Isoprenoid Engineering,"Metabolic engineering has emerged as an important tool for reconstructing heterologous isoprenoid metabolic pathways in microbial hosts. Here, we provide an overview of promising engineering strategies that have proven to be successful for the high-yield production of isoprenoids. Besides ‘conventional’ approaches, such as the ‘push–pull’ and protein engineering to optimize the isoprenoid flux and limited catalytic activity of enzymes, we review emerging strategies in the field, including compartmentalization between synthetic consortia members, novel bypass pathways for isoprenoid synthesis, cell-free systems, and improvement of the lipid content to overcome storage isoprenoid limitations. Pitfalls, along with lessons learned from the application of these strategies, will be addressed with the hope of guiding future efforts toward cost-effective and sustainable production of isoprenoids."
"Nutritional implications of ginger: chemistry, biological activities and signaling pathways","Abstract

Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) has been used as a food, spice, supplement and flavoring agent and in traditional medicines due to its beneficial characteristics such as pungency, aroma, nutrients and pharmacological activity. Ginger and ginger extracts were reported to have numerous effects, such as those on diabetes and metabolic syndrome, cholesterol levels and lipid metabolism, and inflammation, revealed by epidemiological studies. To understand the beneficial characteristics of ginger, especially its physiological and pharmacological activities at the molecular level, the biological effects of ginger constituents, such as monoterpenes (cineole, citral, limonene and a/ß-pinenes), sesquiterpenes (ß-elemene, farnesene and zerumbone), phenolics (gingerols, [6]-shogaol, [6]-paradol and zingerone) and diarylheptanoids (curcumin), and the associated signaling pathways are summarized. Ginger constituents are involved in biological activities, such as apoptosis, cell cycle/DNA damage, chromatin/epigenetic regulation, cytoskeletal regulation and adhesion, immunology and inflammation, and neuroscience, and exert their effects through specific signaling pathways associated with cell functions/mechanisms such as autophagy, cellular metabolism, mitogen-activated protein kinase and other signaling, and development/differentiation. Estrogens, such as phytoestrogens, are one of the most important bioactive materials in nature, and the molecular mechanisms of estrogen actions and the assays to detect them have been discussed. The molecular mechanisms of estrogen actions induced by ginger constituents and related applications, such as the chemoprevention of cancers, and the improvement of menopausal syndromes, osteoporosis, endometriosis, prostatic hyperplasia, polycystic ovary syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, were summarized by a comprehensive search of references to understand more about their health benefits and associated health risks."
"Occurrence and biosynthesis of plant sesterterpenes (C25), a new addition to terpene diversity","Abstract

Terpenes, the largest group of plant-specialized metabolites, have received considerable attention for their highly diverse biological activities. Monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), and triterpenes (C30) have been extensively investigated at both the biochemical and molecular levels over the past two decades. Sesterterpenes (C25), an understudied terpenoid group, were recently described by plant scientists at the molecular level. This review summarizes the plant species that produce sesterterpenes and describes recent developments in the field of sesterterpene biosynthesis, placing a special focus on the catalytic mechanism and evolution of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase and sesterterpene synthase. Finally, we propose several questions to be addressed in future studies, which may help to elucidate sesterterpene metabolism in plants."
On the biosynthesis and evolution of apocarotenoid plant growth regulators,"Abstract

Carotenoids are an important source of metabolites with regulatory function, which include the plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and strigolactones (SLs), and several recently identified growth regulators and signaling molecules. These carotenoid-derivatives originate from oxidative breakdown of double bonds in the carotenoid polyene, a common metabolic process that gives rise to diverse carbonyl cleavage-products known as apocarotenoids. Apocarotenoids exert biologically important functions in all taxa. In plants, they are a major regulator of plant growth, development and response to biotic and abiotic environmental stimuli, and mediate plant’s communication with surrounding organisms. In this article, we provide a general overview on the biology of plant apocarotenoids, focusing on ABA, SLs, and recently identified apocarotenoid growth regulators. Following an introduction on carotenoids, we describe plant apocarotenoid biosynthesis, signal transduction, and evolution and summarize their biological functions. Moreover, we discuss the evolution of these intriguing metabolites, which has not been adequately addressed in the literature."
Opportunistic emissions of volatile isoprenoids,"Isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are synthesized and emitted by some plant species, but not all plant species have this ability. These volatile, nonessential isoprenoid compounds share the same biochemical precursors as larger essential isoprenoids such as gibberellic acids and carotenoids. They have many protective and ecological functions for the plant species that produce them, but plant species that do not produce these compounds also grow and reproduce successfully. Here, we develop an ‘opportunist hypothesis’ suggesting that (i) volatile isoprenoid production takes advantage of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which are synthesized primarily to produce essential isoprenoids, and (ii) conditions affecting synthesis of the higher isoprenoids will affect the production and emission of volatile isoprenoids."
Orchid floral volatiles: Biosynthesis genes and transcriptional regulations,"Abstract

Floral scent and colour are key trait for many floricultural crops. Floral volatiles are biologically and economically important plant derived compounds and they play vital role in pollinator attraction, plant defense and interaction with surrounding the environment. Orchidaceae is one of the largest and most widespread families of flowering plants, with more than 25,000 species. Orchids are one of the most significant plants in ecologically adopted every habitation on earth. Floral volatiles is not limited in its role to pollinator attraction, it’s widely used for perfumes, cosmetics, flavourings and therapeutic applications. Even though biochemistry of floral volatiles is still new field for investigation.Due to importance of the plant biology orchid floral scent research were deeply needed. Analysis of the biosynthesis mechanisms involved in floral scent is necessary to understand the fine-scale molecular functions and to breed to new cultivars through floral volatile genetic engineering approaches. Now a days many researchers developed floral scent models in plants. However, little is known about the pathways responsible for floral scent in orchids, due to the long life cycle and large genome size. Only some terpenoid pathways were reported in orchids. In this review, we mainly concentrated orchid floral volatile regulation and compounds synthesis responsible pathways. Moreover,we mentioned emission of orchid floral volatiles and their function in pollination ecology. This information will provide a basic information on orchid floral scent research."
Overproduction of isoprenoids by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a synthetic grape juice medium in the absence of plant genes,"Abstract

The objective of this work is to demonstrate if the hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase Coq1p might be involved in monoterpenes synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although its currently known function in yeast is to catalyze the first step in ubiquinone biosynthesis. However, in a BY4743 laboratory strain, the presence of an empty plasmid in a chemically defined grape juice medium results in a statistically significant increase of linalool, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol. When COQ1 is overexpressed from a plasmid, the levels of the volatile isoprenoids are further increased. Furthermore, overexpression of COQ1 in the same genetic context but with a mutated farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (erg20 mutation K197E), results in statistically significant higher levels of linalool (above 750?µg/L), geraniol, a-terpineol, and the sesquiterpenes, farnesol and nerolidol (total concentration of volatile isoprenoids surpasses 1300?µg/L). We show that the levels of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that S. cerevisiae can produce, in the absence of plant genes, depend on the composition of the medium and the genetic context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest level of linalool produced by S. cerevisiae up to now. Further research will be needed for understanding how COQ1 and the medium composition might interact to increase flavor complexity of fermented beverages."
Pathway engineering for functional isoprenoids,"Pathway engineering is to engineer biosynthetic pathways for compounds of interests in heterologous organisms such as microbes and higher plants, which has also been one of the most important fields in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. This review focuses on pathway engineering researches for the production of functional isoprenoids containing monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and triterpenes as well as carotenoids and for the elucidation of relevant biosynthesis genes and enzymes, which have been performed in the last two years. As microbial hosts, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have often been employed, since they, specifically the former, are fully amenable to genetic manipulations with extensive molecular resources. Various crops have also been used as the hosts for engineering pathways of functional isoprenoids of the plant origin, particularly carotenoids."
Photosynthetic performance and volatile organic compounds profile in Eucalyptus globulus after UVB radiation,"Abstract

Economically important forest species as Eucalyptus globulus face risks associated with climate changes, whose immediate and long-term damages are yet to account. The aim of this study was to decipher the impacts of UV-B radiation on the physiological performance and metabolome profile of leaves of Eucalyptus juvenile plants. For that, three-month-old plants were treated for two days to a total effective radiation of 12 kJ m-2. One and 11 d after treatment the samples were collected for photosynthetic analyses. UV-B did not affect the photochemical efficiency or gas exchange, but the total soluble sugars (TSS), starch levels and pigment contents were changed. Changes in TSS and pigment contents persisted in time after the end of exposure. The profile of volatile metabolites (1 and 11 days after stress removal) was analyzed by HS-SPME/GC-IT-MS, and showed abundance of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and aldehydes. One day after the stress removal, an increase of aldehydes was observed and a decrease of some monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Eleven days after stress removal, some monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes decreased to values closer to those of control. The absence of mortality, and the minor effects observed in photosynthesis suggest a high tolerance profile of this species to the UV-B dose used, which may be justified by changes at the level of primary metabolism (involving sugars) and secondary (e.g. terpenes) observed in response to UV's. The correlations of these changes with potential functional adaptations are discussed here."
Phylogenetically distant group of terpene synthases participates in cadinene and cedrane-type sesquiterpenes accumulation in Taiwania cryptomerioides,"Abstract

Along with the species evolution, plants have evolved ways to produce a different collection of terpenoids to accommodate its biotic and abiotic environment, and terpene synthase (TPS) is one of the major contributors to various terpene compounds. The timber of a monotypic and relictual conifer species of Cupressace, Taiwania cryptomerioides, has excellent durability, and one of the essential factors for Taiwania to resist decay and insect pests is sesquiterpene. Compared to other conifers, Taiwania has much higher abundance of cadinene-type sesquiterpenes, and the presence of cedrene-type sesquiterpenes. To understand sesquiterpene biosynthesis in Taiwania, we functionally characterized 10 T. cryptomerioides TPSs (TcTPSs) in vivo or in planta, which could catalyze sesquiterpene formation and potentially are involved in biosynthesis of diverse sesquiterpenoids in Taiwania. The distant phylogenetic relationship and the intron loss event of TcTPSs correlate to the differentiation of chemical profile Taiwania compared to other conifers. Furthermore, we identified TcTPS3 and TcTPS12 as d-cadinene synthase, and TcTPS6 as cedrol synthase, which demonstrates the important contributions of dynamic evolution in TPSs to the chemical diversity in plants. Combining with functional characterization and comparison of catalytic residues, we conclude at least three catalytic routes for sesquiterpene biosynthesis in this species, and the skeleton diversity has been expended in T. cryptomeriodes."
Plant Secondary Compounds in Soil and Their Role in Belowground Species Interactions,"Knowledge of the effect of plant secondary compounds (PSCs) on belowground interactions in the more diffuse community of species living outside the rhizosphere is sparse compared with what we know about how PSCs affect aboveground interactions. We illustrate here that PSCs from foliar tissue, root exudates, and leaf litter effectively influence such belowground plant–plant, plant–microorganism, and plant–soil invertebrate interactions. Climatic factors can induce PSC production and select for different plant chemical types. Therefore, climate change can alter both quantitative and qualitative PSC production, and how these compounds move in the soil. This can change the soil chemical environment, with cascading effects on both the ecology and evolution of belowground species interactions and, ultimately, soil functioning."
"Plant volatile terpenoid metabolism: Biosynthetic genes, transcriptional regulation and subcellular compartmentation","Abstract

Volatile terpenoids released from different plant parts play crucial roles in pollinator attraction, plant defense, and interaction with the surrounding environment. Two distinct pathways localized in different subcellular compartments are responsible for the biosynthesis of these compounds. Recent advances in the characterization of genes and enzymes responsible for substrate and end product biosynthesis as well as efforts in metabolic engineering have revealed new aspects of volatile terpenoid biosynthesis. This review summarizes recent progress in the characterization of volatile terpenoid biosynthetic genes, their spatio-temporal expression patterns and subcellular localization of corresponding proteins. In addition, recent information obtained from metabolic engineering is discussed."
Plant volatiles: Using Scented molecules as food additives,"Abstract
Background

Secondary metabolism of plants produces molecules that are widely used in the food industry for many years. The demand for these molecules has been increasing, and special focus has been given to volatile molecules.

Scope

The study of secondary metabolites with special focus on the volatile molecules is overviewed, explaining their bioactivities and examples of application in the food industry.

Approach

Systematic analysis of volatiles and their applications. Specific analysis of volatile components of plants and their use as active packaging and airborne food preservatives.

Key findings

Some work has been done regarding volatiles in terms of food preservation but is focused mostly on postharvest protection. Considering the number of studies regarding the use of volatiles, the industry should start implementing these molecules for more sustainable approaches to preservation.

Conclusions

The food industry has researched plant volatiles for some years, but the focus has been almost exclusively on postharvest protection, and more research can be directed to other food categories. Technology to overcome limitations of plant volatiles is expected to improve, placing pressure on regulatory bodies to allow these molecules in foods, on par with consumer and industry preference for natural-based molecules used in foods."
Plant-derived Secondary Organic Material in the Air and Ecosystems,"Biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and deposited secondary organic material (SOM) are formed by oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants. Many SOA compounds have much longer chemical lifetimes than the original VOC, and may accumulate on plant surfaces and in soil as SOM because of their low volatility. This suggests that they may have important and presently unrecognized roles in plant adaptation. Using reactive plant terpenoids as a model we propose a three-tier (atmosphere–vegetation–soil) framework to better understand the ecological and evolutionary functions of SOM. In this framework, SOA in the atmosphere is known to affect solar radiation, SOM on the plant surfaces influences the interactive organisms, and wet and dry deposition of SOM on soil affects soil organisms."
Plant-Derived Terpenes: A Feedstock for Specialty Biofuels,"Research toward renewable and sustainable energy has identified specific terpenes capable of supplementing or replacing current petroleum-derived fuels. Despite being naturally produced and stored by many plants, there are few examples of commercial recovery of terpenes from plants because of low yields. Plant terpene biosynthesis is regulated at multiple levels, leading to wide variability in terpene content and chemistry. Advances in the plant molecular toolkit, including annotated genomes, high-throughput omics profiling, and genome editing, have begun to elucidate plant terpene metabolism, and such information is useful for bioengineering metabolic pathways for specific terpenes. We review here the status of terpenes as a specialty biofuel and discuss the potential of plants as a viable agronomic solution for future terpene-derived biofuels."
Pre-exposure to nitric oxide modulates the effect of ozone on oxidative defenses and volatile emissions in lima bean,"Abstract

The roles that ozone and nitric oxide (NO), the chief O3 precursor, play in the antioxidative balance and inducible volatile emissions of lima bean were assessed. Exposure to O3 inhibited APX, CAT, and GR, decreased GSH content and induced emissions of (E)-ß-ocimene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, linalool, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (E)-DMNT, 2-butanone and nonanal. O3 did not induce emissions of (E)-ß-caryophyllene and appeared to reduce the antioxidative capacity of plants to a greater extent than NO and NO followed by O3 (NO/O3) treatments. There were significant differences in emissions of (E)-ß-ocimene and linalool between NO/O3 treated plants and controls, but no differences in antioxidant concentrations. A model to explain the relationships between the ascorbate–glutathione cycle and O3 and NO inducible volatiles was proposed. Our findings suggest that prior exposure to NO modulates the oxidative effect of ozone by the process of cross-tolerance, which might regulate the antioxidative system and induction of volatile organic compounds."
Prenyltransferases catalyzing geranyldiphosphate formation in tomato fruit,"Abstract

Monoterpenes contribute either favorably or adversely to the flavor of tomato, yet modern tomato varieties generally lack monoterpenes in their fruit. The main immediate biosynthetic precursor of monoterpenes is geranyldiphosphate (GPP), produced by the action of GPP synthases (GPPSs). Plant GPPSs are often heteromeric enzymes consisting of a non-catalytic small subunit (GPPS.SSU) and a large subunit (GPPS.LSU), the latter similar to geranylgeranyldiphosphate synthases (GGPPSs) which generate longer prenylphosphate chains. We show here that LeGGPPS2, an enzyme previously reported to support carotenoid biosynthesis, can synthesize farnesyldiphosphate (FPP) and GPP in vitro, in addition to geranylgeranyldiphosphate, depending on the assay conditions. Moreover, GPP formation is favored in vitro by the interaction of LeGGPPS2 with GPPS.SSU from either Anthirrhinum majus (AmGPPS.SSU) or from a newly discovered GPPS.SSU ortholog present in the genome of M82 tomato. SlGPPS.SSU is not expressed in M82 tomato fruit but its orthologs are expressed in fruit of wild tomato relatives, such as Solanum pimpinelifollium and S. cheesmaniae that accumulate monoterpenes."
Production of plant metabolites with applications in the food industry using engineered microorganisms,"Secondary plant metabolites are extensively used in today’s food industries, for example, as coloring-agents, flavouring-agents or texturizing agents. In particular, metabolites with antioxidative properties find applications as preservatives or anti-browning agents. Today, extraction from plant material represents the major source of these metabolites, but progress in the field of metabolic engineering also enabled the microbial production of these valuable compounds as a more economic and ecological alternative. This review article presents the current state of metabolic engineering of microorganisms for production of plant metabolites with applications in the food industries. We focus on compounds, which are already used in food applications, discuss current limitations of microbial plant metabolite production, and outline strategies on how these challenges can be addressed in the future."
Production of the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene by metabolically engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum,"Abstract

The sesquiterpene (+)-valencene is an aroma compound of citrus fruits and is used to flavor foods and drinks. Biosynthesis of (+)-valencene starts from farnesyl pyrophosphate, an intermediate of carotenoid biosynthesis. Corynebacterium glutamicum, the workhorse of the million-ton scale amino acid industry, is naturally pigmented as it synthesizes the rare fifty carbon atoms (C50) containing carotenoid decaprenoxanthin. Since the carotenoid pathway of this Gram-positive bacterium has previously been engineered for efficient production of several C50 and C40 carotenoids, its potential to produce a sesquiterpene was assessed. Growth of C. glutamicum was negatively affected by (+)-valencene, but overlaying n-dodecane as organic phase for extraction of (+)-valencene was shown to be biocompatible. Heterologous expression of the (+)-valencene synthase gene from the sweet orange Citrus sinensis was not sufficient to enable (+)-valencene production, likely because provision of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) by endogenous prenyltransferases was too low. However, upon deletion of two endogenous prenyltransferase genes and heterologous expression of either FPP synthase gene ispA from Escherichia coli or ERG20 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (+)-valence production by C. sinensis valencene synthase was observed. Employing the valencene synthase from Nootka cypress improved (+)-valencene titers 10 fold to 2.41 ± 0.26 mg l-1 (+)-valencene, which is equivalent to 0.25 ± 0.03 mg g-1 cell dry weight (CDW). This is the first report on sesquiterpene overproduction by recombinant C. glutamicum."
Progressive Regulation of Sesquiterpene Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin) by the miR156-Targeted SPL Transcription Factors,"Abstract

Plant metabolites vary at different stages of their life cycle. Although it is well documented that environmental factors stimulate biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, the regulation by endogenous developmental cues remains poorly understood. The microRNA156 (miR156)-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) factors function as a major age cue in regulating developmental phase transition and flowering. We show here that the miR156-targeted SPL transcription factor plays an important role in the spatiotemporal regulation of sesquiterpene biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the miR156-SPL module regulates the formation of (E)-ß-caryophyllene in the flowering stage through modulating expression of the sesquiterpene synthase gene TPS21. We demonstrated that SPL9 directly binds to TPS21 promoter and activates its expression. In the perennial fragrant herb Pogostemon cablin, the accumulation of patchouli oil, largely composed of sesquiterpenes dominated by (-)-patchoulol, is also age-regulated, and the SPL promotes biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes in elder plants by upregulating patchoulol synthase (PatPTS) gene expression. As miR156-SPLs are highly conserved in plants, our finding not only uncovers a molecular link between developmental timing and sesquiterpene production but also suggests a new strategy to engineer plants for accelerated growth with enhanced production of terpenoids."
Purification and kinetic properties of elisabethatriene synthase from the coral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae,"Abstract

The Bahamian octocoral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae is the source of pseudopterosins, diterpene glycosides with potent anti-inflammatory activity. The first committed step in pseudopterosin biosynthesis comprises the cyclisation of the universal diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate to elisabethatriene. This reaction is catalysed by elisabethatriene synthase, which was purified to homogeneity from a crude coral extract. This represents the first purification to apparent homogeneity of a terpene cyclase from any marine source. The reaction kinetics of elisabethatriene synthase was examined using a steady state approach with 3H-labelled isoprenyldiphosphates varying in carbon chain length (C10, C15, C20). For the reaction of elisabethatriene synthase with its natural substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate, values of Km (2.3 × 10- 6 M), Vmax (3.4 × 104 nM elisabethatriene * s- 1) and the specificity constant (kcat / Km = 1.8 × 10- 10 M- 1 * s- 1) were comparable with diterpene cyclases from terrestrial plants. Elisabethatriene synthase also catalysed the conversion of C15 and C10 isoprenyldiphosphate analogues to monoterpene and sesquiterpene olefins, respectively. Kinetic parameters indicated that substrate specificity and Km of elisabethatriene synthase decreased with decreasing isoprenoid carbon chain length. Furthermore, GC–MS analysis showed increased product diversity with decreasing isoprenoid carbon chain length."
Pyrolytic formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from sesquiterpenes,"Abstract

The products of the pyrolysis of four sesquiterpenes, ß-caryophyllene, a-cedrene, longifolene and valencene, have been examined. Pyrolysis was carried out at 300, 400 and 500 °C, the products determined by GC–MS and then examined for similarities and differences using multivariate data analysis. Analysis showed that longifolene was most resistant and caryophyllene least resistant to pyrolysis with cedrene and valencene occupying intermediate positions. While the compounds were largely unchanged at 300 °C, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were major components of the pyrolysates at 400 and 500 °C. No less than nine of the 16 EPA priority pollutants were present in the pyrolysates at the higher temperatures."
Recent advances in biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in traditional Chinese medicinal plants,"Abstract

Plants synthesize and accumulate large amount of specialized (or secondary) metabolites also known as natural products, which provide a rich source for modern pharmacy. In China, plants have been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years. Recent development of molecular biology, genomics and functional genomics as well as high-throughput analytical chemical technologies has greatly promoted the research on medicinal plants. In this article, we review recent advances in the elucidation of biosynthesis of specialized metabolites in medicinal plants, including phenylpropanoids, terpenoids and alkaloids. These natural products may share a common upstream pathway to form a limited numbers of common precursors, but are characteristic in distinct modifications leading to highly variable structures. Although this review is focused on traditional Chinese medicine, other plants with a great medicinal interest or potential are also discussed. Understanding of their biosynthesis processes is critical for producing these highly value molecules at large scale and low cost in microbes and will benefit to not only human health but also plant resource conservation."
Recent advances in essential oils-based metal nanoparticles: A review on recent developments and biopharmaceutical applications,"Abstract

Biogenic synthesis of metal/metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) by reducing metal ions using secondary metabolites of plant essential oils is a single step and an eco-friendly approach. This biogenic synthesis of metal nanoparticles is somewhat fast, conducted readily at low temperatures and pressures, and a quite easy process. Metal nanoparticle synthesis using essential oils is environmentally-friendly or bio-safe. Essential oils (EOs) are complex lipids and contain a range of volatile and organic bioactive compounds, having huge applications in the medical, cosmetics and food industries. In this review, we have discussed the current developments on preparation of metal nanoparticles using essential oils and their biological properties in various applications. The various methods of nanoparticle characterizations are analyzed and potential applications of these nanoparticles are reviewed."
Recent advances in synthetic biology for engineering isoprenoid production in yeast,"Isoprenoids (terpenes/terpenoids) have many useful industrial applications, but are often not produced at industrially viable level in their natural sources. Synthetic biology approaches have been used extensively to reconstruct metabolic pathways in tractable microbial hosts such as yeast and re-engineer pathways and networks to increase yields. Here we review recent advances in this field, focusing on central carbon metabolism engineering to increase precursor supply, re-directing carbon flux for production of C10, C15, or C20 isoprenoids, and chemical decoration of high value diterpenoids (C20). We also overview other novel synthetic biology strategies that have potential utility in yeast isoprenoid pathway engineering. Finally, we address the question of what is required in the future to move the field forwards."
Recent advances in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Abstract

Isoprenoids, as the largest group of chemicals in the domains of life, constitute more than 50,000 members. These compounds consist of different numbers of isoprene units (C5H8), by which they are typically classified into hemiterpenoids (C5), monoterpenoids (C10), sesquiterpenoids (C15), diterpenoids (C20), triterpenoids (C30), and tetraterpenoids (C40). In recent years, isoprenoids have been employed as food additives, in the pharmaceutical industry, as advanced biofuels, and so on. To realize the sufficient and efficient production of valuable isoprenoids on an industrial scale, fermentation using engineered microorganisms is a promising strategy compared to traditional plant extraction and chemical synthesis. Due to the advantages of mature genetic manipulation, robustness and applicability to industrial bioprocesses, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has become an attractive microbial host for biochemical production, including that of various isoprenoids. In this review, we summarized the advances in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in engineered S. cerevisiae over several decades, including synthetic pathway engineering, microbial host engineering, and central carbon pathway engineering. Furthermore, the challenges and corresponding strategies towards improving isoprenoid production in engineered S. cerevisiae were also summarized. Finally, suggestions and directions for isoprenoid production in engineered S. cerevisiae in the future are discussed."
Recent advances in the microbial production and recovery of apolar molecules,"Several apolar molecules of interest for the production of fuels and chemicals can nowadays be produced by fermentation. Those secreted from the microbial cell are of particular interest for large scale bioprocessing, since they allow for cell reuse, in situ product recovery and competitive production levels. So far, however, bioprocess strategies for fermentation and product recovery have been developed for addressing needs at the laboratory scale, rather than the process scale. Most commonly used strategies include extractive fermentations, product stripping in the gas phase, and off-line de-emulsification followed by intensive centrifugation. At the same time, current techno-economic studies at process scale have demonstrated the absolute need for significant improvements in both microorganism and process technology, for these processes to become competitive."
Regulation of floral scent production in petunia revealed by targeted metabolomics,"Abstract

Petunia hybrida line W115 (Mitchell) has large white flowers that produce a pleasant fragrance. By applying solid phase micro extraction (SPME) techniques coupled to GC–MS analysis, volatile emission was monitored in vivo using a targeted metabolomics approach. Mature flowers released predominantly benzenoid compounds of which benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, methylbenzoate, phenylethylalcohol, iso-eugenol and benzylbenzoate were most abundant. This emission had a circadian rhythm reaching its maximum at dusk. During petal limb expansion two sesquiterpenes were emitted by the petunia flowers, tentatively identified as germacrene D and cadina-3,9-diene. In vitro analysis showed that the petal limbs and stigma were the main producers of the benzenoids and sesquiterpenes, respectively. Moreover, comparison of in vivo and in vitro analysis indicated that volatiles were not stored during periods of low emission but rather were synthesized de novo. DNA-microarray analysis revealed that genes of the pathways leading to the production of volatile benzenoids were upregulated late during the day, preceding the increase of volatile emission. RNA-gel blot analyses confirmed that the levels of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) synthase transcripts increased towards the evening. Our results suggest that the circadian production of volatile benzenoids in petunia W115 is, at least partly, regulated at the transcript level."
Remodeling the isoprenoid pathway in tobacco by expressing the cytoplasmic mevalonate pathway in chloroplasts,"Abstract

Metabolic engineering to enhance production of isoprenoid metabolites for industrial and medical purposes is an important goal. The substrate for isoprenoid synthesis in plants is produced by the mevalonate pathway (MEV) in the cytosol and by the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids. A multi-gene approach was employed to insert the entire cytosolic MEV pathway into the tobacco chloroplast genome. Molecular analysis confirmed the site-specific insertion of seven transgenes and homoplasmy. Functionality was demonstrated by unimpeded growth on fosmidomycin, which specifically inhibits the MEP pathway. Transplastomic plants containing the MEV pathway genes accumulated higher levels of mevalonate, carotenoids, squalene, sterols, and triacyglycerols than control plants. This is the first time an entire eukaryotic pathway with six enzymes has been transplastomically expressed in plants. Thus, we have developed an important tool to redirect metabolic fluxes in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway and a viable multigene strategy for engineering metabolism in plants."
Resin-based defenses in conifers,"Abstract

Bark beetle infestation and associated fungal infection are a serious disease problem in conifer species. Conifers have evolved elaborate, constitutive and inducible, terpene-based defense mechanisms to deter insect pests and their symbiotic fungal pathogens. This process involves the secretion of oleoresin, a complex mixture of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenoid acids. Induced oleoresinosis in grand fir (Abies grandis) provides a model system for studying the regulation of defensive terpene biosynthesis and for identifying relevant genes. The ecological relationships between conifers, beetle pests, beetle predators and fungal pathogens present several possible avenues for manipulating oleoresin composition to improve tree resistance. Possible examples include chemically disguising the host, adding toxins and altering the levels of pheromone precursors, attractants for predators or hormone mimics to disrupt insect development. Strategies and prospects for generating transgenic conifers with increased defense capability are discussed."
"Rethinking of botanical volatile organic compounds applied in food preservation: Challenges in acquisition, application, microbial inhibition and stimulation","Abstract
Background

With the rising demand of microbiologically and chemically safe food products, conventional chemical preservatives are gradually fading away from the interests of both researchers and consumers. Thus, natural products are considered as promising substitution, especially botanical volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with bio-compatibility, accessibility and practicability, which are found versatile in defending both foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms.

Scope and approach

This article aims to comprehensively review the biosynthesis and antimicrobial mechanism of VOCs, collects and selects current and potential applications of VOCs in food pathogen control from both applied and basic research. Antimicrobial mechanisms of VOCs are divided into direct and indirect effects combined with summarization of potential VOCs candidates as antimicrobials. Biosynthesis and their rate-limited steps of VOCs in plants are systematically summarized in this review, furnishing a guideline for synthetic biology of VOC production. Challenges involving side-effects, microbial detoxification, toxicity, and acquisition of VOCs with possible solutions are elaborated.

Key findings and conclusions

Conceptual distinction is conducted between VOCs and essential oils (EOs), where synergetic and antagonistic effects of every single VOC component in EOs require more investigations. Synthetic biology enables large-scale production of VOCs instead of traditional extraction technique, however, detailed VOC biosynthesis pathway should be deciphered. Versatile applied platforms including modified atmosphere package, emulsion and coating are solutions for solving challenges impairing VOC practical application. Applied concentration and type of VOC directly influence on the safety and efficiency. Thus, strict regulation and safety assessment are demanded due to potential toxicity."
Structure and Dynamics of the Isoprenoid Pathway Network,"ABSTRACT

Isoprenoids are functionally and structurally the most diverse group of plant metabolites reported to date. They can function as primary metabolites, participating in essential plant cellular processes, and as secondary metabolites, of which many have substantial commercial, pharmacological, and agricultural value. Isoprenoid end products participate in plants in a wide range of physiological processes acting in them both synergistically, such as chlorophyll and carotenoids during photosynthesis, or antagonistically, such as gibberellic acid and abscisic acid during seed germination. It is therefore expected that fluxes via isoprenoid metabolic network are tightly controlled both temporally and spatially, and that this control occurs at different levels of regulation and in an orchestrated manner over the entire isoprenoid metabolic network. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the topology of the plant isoprenoid pathway network and its regulation at the gene expression level following diverse stimuli. We conclude by discussing agronomical and biotechnological applications emerging from the plant isoprenoid metabolism and provide an outlook on future directions in the systems analysis of the plant isoprenoid pathway network."
"Variation in the amino acids, volatile organic compounds and terpenes profiles in induced polyploids and in Solanum tuberosum varieties","Abstract

Polyploids often display a variety of phenotypic novelties when compared to their diploid progenitors, some of which may represent ecological advantages, especially regarding tolerance to biotic and abiotic factors. Plants cope with environmental factors by producing chemicals such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and specific amino acids (AAs). In potato, the third most important food crop in the world, gene introgression from diploid wild relative species into the genetic pool of the cultivated species (tetraploid) would be of great agronomical interest. The consequences of allopolyploidization on the potato VOCs and AAs profiles have not been yet analyzed. In this work, the effects of whole genome duplication on VOCs and AAs contents in leaves of potato allo- and autotetraploids and cultivated varieties were studied. The polyploids were obtained by chromosomal duplication of a genotype of the wild diploid species S. kurtzianum (autopolyploid model), and a diploid interspecific hybrid between the cultivated species S. tuberosum and S. kurtzianum (allopolyploid model). Almost all compounds levels varied greatly among these tetraploid lines; while all tetraploids showed higher contents of non-isoprenoids compounds than diploids, we found either increments or reductions in terpenes and AAs content. The results support the idea that genome duplication is a stochastic source of variability, which might be directly used for introgression in the 4x gene pool of the cultivated potato by sexual hybridization."
Volatile isoprenoids and their importance for protection against environmental constraints in the Mediterranean area,"Abstract

Among plant secondary metabolites, volatile isoprenoids have received increasing attention because they are involved in a range of physiological and ecological interactions, often helping plants cope with abiotic and biotic stressors, and potentially affecting the chemistry of the troposphere once they are emitted in the air. We review evidence about the beneficial functions of volatile isoprenoids in leaves, principally as antioxidants and membrane stabilizing agents, avoiding heat damage. Because the Mediterranean environment is characterized by prolonged dry and hot seasons, and recurrent heat-waves, we surmise that volatile isoprenoids are particularly widespread, and play an important physiological role, in Mediterranean woody plants. Based on a review of available inventories, isoprene emission characterizes deciduous woody plants, whereas evergreens are more often monoterpene emitters. Monoterpene emitters may be better fit to the Mediterranean climate, and, in general, to climate conditions favoring evergreens."
Volatile organic compound emission and residual substances from plants in light of the globally increasing CO2 level,"Abstract

Global carbon dioxide emission in the atmosphere is increasing in the last years more than ever with values of 414 ppm in July 2020. For plants, more CO2 in the air is beneficial because the rate of photosynthetic carbon fixation is increasing, which determines more biomass production. An increase in CO2 brings with it climate change, which includes global warming and extreme phenomena. Such stress factors affect the development and metabolic pathways of plants. To counteract the effects of abiotic and biotic stresses, plants used different defense strategies, including volatile organic compounds emission. Plants are emitting different compounds such as terpenes, aromatic compounds, alcohols, and aldehydes. There are many papers which are dealing with the emission of volatile compounds from plants under abiotic and biotic stresses. Our review is focused on the emission of volatile organic compounds from plants under climate change and their implication in atmospheric chemistry and human health."
Volatile organic compound emissions from Alnus glutinosa under interacting drought and herbivory stresses,"Abstract

Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) elicited in response to herbivory can serve as cues for parasitic and predatory insects, but the modification of VOC elicitation responses under interacting abiotic stresses is poorly known. We studied foliage VOC emissions in the deciduous tree Alnus glutinosa induced by feeding by the larvae of green alder sawfly (Monsoma pulveratum) under well-watered and drought-stressed conditions. Drought strongly curbed photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance, but there were no effects of insect feeding on photosynthetic characteristics. Feeding induced emissions of volatile products of lipoxygenase pathway and monoterpenes, and emissions of stress marker compounds (E)-ß-ocimene and homoterpene DMNT. The emissions were more strongly elicited and reached a maximum value earlier in drought-stressed plants. In addition, methyl salicylate emissions were elicited in herbivory-fed drought-stressed plants. Herbivores were more strongly attracted to well-watered plants and consumed more than a four-fold greater fraction of leaf area than they consumed from drought-treated plants. Overall, this study demonstrates an important priming effect of drought, suggesting that plants under combined drought/herbivory stress are more resistant to herbivores."
Volatile profiling from heartwood of East Indian sandalwood tree,"Abstract
Background

Volatile aroma compounds are important characteristics determining essential oil quality. The heartwood of sandalwood tree, Santalum album L. deposits the sandalwood oil with enormous therapeutic potentials. The majority of the biological activities are attributed to the sesquiterpenoid alcohols i.e. santalols and hence, there is the need to explore the presence of other volatile bioactive constituents from heartwood.

Methods

We used a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method employing an ion trap quadrupole (ITQ) mass analyzer to identify and quantify volatiles from solvent extracted heartwood oil of the East Indian sandalwood tree, S. album L.

Results

A total of 46 constituents composed of a great variety of n-alkanes, sesquiterpenoids, fatty acids, aldehydes, naphthalene derivatives, methyl esters, alcohols, carotenoid degradation products, and acetates were identified. Oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, i.e., Z-a-santalol and epi-ß-santalol and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were identified as the major constituents in the extracted oil.

Conclusion

Results indicate that GC–ITQ–MS is a robust tool for qualitative and quantitative analysis of volatile constituents of the heartwood of sandalwood tree. Furthermore, the constituents reported may lead to the discovery of novel phytopharmaceuticals from sandalwood tree."
Volatile science? Metabolic engineering of terpenoids in plants,"Terpenoids are important for plant survival and also possess biological properties that are beneficial to humans. Here, we describe the state of the art in terpenoid metabolic engineering, showing that significant progress has been made over the past few years. Subcellular targeting of enzymes has demonstrated that terpenoid precursors in subcellular compartments are not as strictly separated as previously thought and that multistep pathway engineering is feasible, even across cell compartments. These engineered plants show that insect behavior is influenced by terpenoids. In the future, we expect rapid progress in the engineering of terpenoid production in plants. In addition to commercial applications, such transgenic plants should increase our understanding of the biological relevance of these volatile secondary metabolites."
Yeast metabolic engineering – Targeting sterol metabolism and terpenoid formation,"Abstract

Terpenoids comprise various structures conferring versatile functions to eukaryotes, for example in the form of prenyl-anchors they attach proteins to membranes. The physiology of eukaryotic membranes is fine-tuned by another terpenoid class, namely sterols. Evidence is accumulating that numerous membrane proteins require specific sterol structural features for function. Moreover, sterols are intermediates in the synthesis of steroids serving as hormones in higher eukaryotes. Like steroids many compounds of the terpenoid family do not contribute to membrane architecture, but serve as signalling, protective or attractant/repellent molecules. Particularly plants have developed a plenitude of terpenoid biosynthetic routes branching off early in the sterol biosynthesis pathway and, thereby, forming one of the largest groups of naturally occurring organic compounds. Many of these aromatic and volatile molecules are interesting for industrial application ranging from foods to pharmaceuticals. Combining the fortunate situation that sterol biosynthesis is highly conserved in eukaryotes with the amenability of yeasts to genetic and metabolic engineering, basically all naturally occurring terpenoids might be produced involving yeasts. Such engineered yeasts are useful for the study of biological functions and molecular interactions of terpenoids as well as for the large-scale production of high-value compounds, which are unavailable in sufficient amounts from natural sources due to their low abundance."
Centella asiatica: phytochemistry and mechanisms of neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement,"This review describes in detail the phytochemistry and neurological effects of the medicinal herb Centella asiatica (L.) Urban. C. asiatica is a small perennial plant that grows in moist, tropical and sub-tropical regions throughout the world. Phytochemicals identified from C. asiatica to date include isoprenoids (sesquiterpenes, plant sterols, pentacyclic triterpenoids and saponins) and phenylpropanoid derivatives (eugenol derivatives, caffeoylquinic acids, and flavonoids). Contemporary methods for fingerprinting and characterization of compounds in C. asiatica extracts include liquid chromatography and/or ion mobility spectrometry in conjunction with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Multiple studies in rodent models, and a limited number of human studies, support C. asiatica’s traditional reputation as a cognitive enhancer, as well as its anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects. Neuroprotective effects of C. asiatica are seen in several in vitro models, for example against beta amyloid toxicity, and appear to be associated with increased mitochondrial activity, improved antioxidant status, and/or inhibition of the pro-inflammatory enzyme, phospholipase A2. Neurotropic effects of C. asiatica include increased dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis, and may be due to modulations of signal transduction pathways such as ERK1/2 and Akt. Many of these neurotropic and neuroprotective properties of C. asiatica have been associated with the triterpene compounds asiatic acid, asiaticoside and madecassoside. More recently, caffeoylquinic acids are emerging as a second important group of active compounds in C. asiatica, with the potential of enhancing the Nrf2-antioxidant response pathway. The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the triterpenes, caffeoylquinic acids and flavonoids found in C. asiatica have been studied in humans and animal models, and the compounds or their metabolites found in the brain. This review highlights the remarkable potential for C. asiatica extracts and derivatives to be used in the treatment of neurological conditions, and considers the further research needed to actualize this possibility."
Thymus vulgaris L. (Thyme): In Vitro Culture and the Production of Secondary Metabolites,"
              Thymus is a perennial herb of the Labiatae family (Fig. 1A) and can grow to a height of some 30 cm. There are more than 100 varieties of Thymus distributed throughout Europe. It has dark green leaves and light mauve-pink flowers in early summer. Thyme is a good rock-garden plant, as it spreads easily. It originates on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and in the region of Asia Minor. Now it is cultivated in numerous European countries, Russia, Canada, America, and some of the North African countries. Thyme is one of the great culinary and medicinal herbs, and is a classic constituent of a bouquet garni (Fleming 1990), but only a few species are used in the kitchen, e.g., common thyme (T. vulgaris) and lemon thyme (T. citriodorus.) The essential oil (Marhuenda et al. 1988; Blazquez and Zafra-Polo 1989) of thyme has also been reported to be effective in food preservatives, antioxidants (Farag et al. 1990), antimicrobials (Morris et al. 1979), breath-freshen- ing dentifrices (Ishikawa and Shibuya 1989), medical disinfectants, etc. In general, the dried leaves contain 0.7–2.5% dry wt. of the essential oil. The major components are thymol (15–62%), carvacrol (2–44%), p-cymene, and ?-terpinene. The typical chemical structure is shown in Fig. 2."
A genomics resource for investigating regulation of essential oil production in Lavandula angustifolia,"We are developing Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) as a model system for investigating molecular regulation of essential oil (a mixture of mono- and sesquiterpenes) production in plants. As an initial step toward building the necessary ‘genomics toolbox’ for this species, we constructed two cDNA libraries from lavender leaves and flowers, and obtained sequence information for 14,213 high-quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Based on homology to sequences present in GenBank, our EST collection contains orthologs for genes involved in the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) and the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways of terpenoid biosynthesis, and for known terpene synthases and prenyl transferases. To gain insight into the regulation of terpene metabolism in lavender flowers, we evaluated the transcriptional activity of the genes encoding for 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), which represent regulatory steps of the DXP and MVA pathways, respectively, in glandular trichomes (oil glands) by real-time PCR. While HMGR transcripts were barely detectable, DXS was heavily expressed in this tissue, indicating that essential oil constituents are predominantly produced through the DXP pathway in lavender glandular trichomes. As anticipated, the linalool synthase (LinS)—the gene responsible for the production of linalool, a major constituent of lavender essential oil—was also strongly expressed in glands. Surprisingly, the most abundant transcript in floral glandular trichomes corresponded to a sesquiterpene synthase (cadinene synthase, CadS), although sesquiterpenes are minor constituents of lavender essential oils. This result, coupled to the weak activity of the MVA pathway (the main route for sesquiterpene production) in trichomes, indicates that precursor supply may represent a bottleneck in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes in lavender flowers."
"Abscisic Acid and Fruit Ripening: Its Role in Grapevine Acclimation to the Environment, a Case of Study","The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is a sesquiterpene (C15) produced not only in plants, but also by algae, fungi and bacteria. In higher plants, ABA is produced in plastids via the methyl erythritol phosphate that leads to carotene biosynthesis. ABA levels in plant tissues are regulated by biosynthesis, catabolism and reversible conjugation with glucose. Cell site of ABA synthesis is associated with its role in the control of stomata movement. ABA alleviates plant tissues from water stress by inducing stomata closure that hampers water restriction, although CO2 diffusion is also lessened and therefore photosynthesis limited. However, ABA is also critical for growth and yield under non-stressful conditions, and even it promotes growth and cropping under stressful situations and in different species by improving water use efficiency and dry matter accumulation. In fruits ABA participates in their growth, development and ripening, interplaying with other phytohormones and regulating a complex network of transcriptional factors. The control by ABA of grape berry ripening and its role in grapevines acclimation to solar ultraviolet-B and moderate water restriction is analyzed as a case of study. The results obtained involve crop increases as a result of fruit set stimulation, along with modulation in carbohydrate transport, enhancement of membrane stability via sterol biosynthesis, increase of antioxidant enzymes, and promotion of phloem tissue. ABA also induces production of metabolites with antioxidant properties, like phenolic and volatile organic compounds, in berry skins, so anticipating berry ripening and improving the fruit characteristics for high-quality winemaking."
An IDS-Type Sesquiterpene Synthase Produces the Pheromone Precursor (Z)-a-Bisabolene in Nezara viridula,"Insects use a wide range of structurally diverse pheromones for intra-specific communication. Compounds in the class of terpenes are emitted as sex, aggregation, alarm, or trail pheromones. Despite the common occurrence of terpene pheromones in different insect lineages, their origin from dietary host plant precursors or de novo biosynthetic pathways often remains unknown. Several stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) release bisabolene-type sesquiterpenes for aggregation and mating. Here we provide evidence for de novo biosynthesis of the sex pheromone trans-/cis-(Z)-a-bisabolene epoxide of the Southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula. We show that an enzyme (NvTPS) related to isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs) of the core terpene metabolic pathway functions as a terpene synthase (TPS), which converts the general intermediate (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to the putative pheromone precursor (+)-(S,Z)-a-bisabolene in vitro and in protein lysates. A second identified IDS-type protein (NvFPPS) makes the TPS substrate (E,E)-FPP and functions as a bona fide FPP synthase. NvTPS is highly expressed in male epidermal tissue associated with the cuticle of ventral sternites, which is in agreement with the male specific release of the pheromone from glandular cells in this tissue. Our study supports findings of the function of similar TPS enzymes in the biosynthesis of aggregation pheromones from the pine engraver beetle Ips pini, the striped flea beetle Phyllotreta striolata, and the harlequin bug Murgantia histrionica, and hence provides growing evidence for the evolution of terpene de novo biosynthesis by IDS-type TPS families in insects."
"Analysis of expressed sequence tags from Actinidia: applications of a cross species EST database for gene discovery in the areas of flavor, health, color and ripening","Kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) are a relatively new, but economically important crop grown in many different parts of the world. Commercial success is driven by the development of new cultivars with novel consumer traits including flavor, appearance, healthful components and convenience. To increase our understanding of the genetic diversity and gene-based control of these key traits in Actinidia, we have produced a collection of 132,577 expressed sequence tags (ESTs)."
Anemia tomentosa var. anthriscifolia in vitro culture: sporophyte development and volatile compound profile of an aromatic fern,"Anemia tomentosa var. anthriscifolia is an aromatic fern with a pleasant woody aroma and antimycobacterial activity. In this paper, we describe for the first time its spore-derived gametophyte development and the effect of indole-3-acetic acid and jasmonic acid on in vitro gametophyte/sporophyte development, as well as volatile compound production. Volatiles were obtained by simultaneous distillation and extraction (SDE) and analyzed by high resolution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Spore-derived gametophytes were able to develop into sporophytes independently of the media culture composition, even when no plant growth regulator was added. Fifty different substances were detected in all in vitro A. tomentosa SDE extracts, while 20 were detected in the wild SDE plant extract. Monoterpenes were more prevalent (69.8–89.8%) than sesquiterpenes (9.4–28.7%) in in vitro plants, while sesquiterpenes represent 97.5% of the volatiles produced by the wild-grown plants. The major monoterpene components in in vitro plants were a-pinene (9.3–24.3%), trans-pinocarveol (20.6–27.9%), pinocarvone (15.4–25.1%) and myrtenyl acetate (6.4–12.3%). The triquinane sesquiterpenes silphiperfol-6-ene (0.6–2.9%), a-guaiene (0.5–2.5%), ß-barbatene (1.1–3.9%) and 9-epi-presilphiperfolan-1-ol (2.5–5.6%) represent the most abundant sesquiterpenes. The changes in the monoterpene/sesquiterpene rates between micropropagated and wild plants are not related to the presence of JA or IAA in the media culture. Further studies are still needed to obtain a complete understanding of the factors leading to these results, which could be related to differences in the irradiance levels of in vitro plants versus those from a wild environment, as well as the developmental stage of the plants. This is the first report of the use of plant growth regulators on Anemia tomentosa in vitro culture development and their effects on volatile profiles."
Apocarotenoids: A New Carotenoid-Derived Pathway,"Carotenoids are precursors of carotenoid derived molecules termed apocarotenoids, which include isoprenoids with important functions in plant-environment interactions such as the attraction of pollinators and the defense against pathogens and herbivores. Apocarotenoids also include volatile aromatic compounds that act as repellents, chemoattractants, growth simulators and inhibitors, as well as the phytohormones abscisic acid and strigolactones. In plants, apocarotenoids can be found in several types of plastids (etioplast, leucoplast and chromoplast) and among different plant tissues such as flowers and roots. The structural similarity of some flower and spice isoprenoid volatile organic compounds (ß-ionone and safranal) to carotenoids has led to the recent discovery of carotenoid-specific cleavage oxygenases, including carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases and 9-cis-epoxydioxygenases, which tailor and transform carotenoids into apocarotenoids. The great diversity of apocarotenoids is a consequence of the huge amount of carotenoid precursors, the variations in specific cleavage sites and the modifications after cleavage. Lycopene, ß-carotene and zeaxanthin are the precursors of the main apocarotenoids described to date, which include bixin, crocin, picrocrocin, abscisic acid, strigolactone and mycorradicin."
"Apocarotenoids: hormones, mycorrhizal metabolites and aroma volatiles","Apocarotenoids are tailored from carotenoids by oxidative enzymes [carotenoid cleavage oxygenases (CCOs)], cleaving specific double bonds of the polyene chain. The cleavage products can act as hormones, signaling compounds, chromophores and scent/aroma constituents. Recent advances were the identification of strigolactones as apocarotenoids and the description of their novel role as shoot branching inhibitor hormones. Strigolactones are also involved in plant signaling to both harmful (parasitic weeds) and beneficial [arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi] rhizosphere residents. This review describes the progress in the characterization of CCOs, termed CCDs and NCEDs, in plants. It highlights the importance of sequential cleavage reactions of C40 carotenoid precursors, the apocarotenoid cleavage oxygenase (ACO) nature of several CCOs and the topic of compartmentation. Work on the biosynthesis of abundant C13 cyclohexenone and C14 mycorradicin apocarotenoids in mycorrhizal roots has revealed a new role of CCD1 as an ACO of C27 apocarotenoid intermediates, following their predicted export from plastid to cytosol. Manipulation of the AM-induced apocarotenoid pathway further suggests novel roles of C13 apocarotenoids in controlling arbuscule turnover in the AM symbiosis. CCD7 has been established as a biosynthetic crosspoint, controlling both strigolactone and AM-induced C13 apocarotenoid biosynthesis. Interdependence of the two apocarotenoid pathways may thus play a role in AM-mediated reduction of parasitic weed infestations. Potential scenarios of C13 scent/aroma volatile biogenesis are discussed, including the novel mechanism revealed from mycorrhizal roots. The recent progress in apocarotenoid research opens up new perspectives for fundamental work, but has also great application potential for the horticulture, food and fragrance industries."
"Artemisia annua L. and photoresponse: from artemisinin accumulation, volatile profile and anatomical modifications to gene expression","Blue and yellow light affected metabolism and the morphology. Blue and red promote the DOXP/MEP pathway. ADS gene expression was increased in plants cultivated under blue, promoting artemisinin content."
Bioinformatics approach to understand nature’s unified mechanism of stereo-divergent synthesis of isoprenoid skeletons,"In isoprenoid metabolism, cyclisation is the important gateway to chemical diversity. Terpene synthase is responsible for the cyclisation of a few universal substrates forming hundreds of often stereo-chemically complex mono- and poly-cyclic terpene hydrocarbons with a broad spectrum of functions in pharmaceuticals, flavours and fragrance industry. Although they are discovered and characterised mainly from plants and fungi, yet only a small share of bacterial terpenes has been investigated so far owing to their low level of expression in wild-type microorganisms. Extensive bacterial genome mining has revealed a treasure trove of terpene synthase genes and their regulated heterologous overexpression has pitched-in to describe the biochemical function of putative genes and sequester new terpene metabolites. This review deals with the modern genome mining techniques and molecular methods, providing more experimental tools for studying the structure and functions of terpenoid metabolites and strongly supports the idea that genome mining is a utile approach in deciphering the terpenoid diversity in bacteria."
"Bioproducts, Biofuels, and Perfumes: Conifer Terpene Synthases and their Potential for Metabolic Engineering","Conifer trees, including the economically and ecologically important pine (Pinus), spruce (Picea), and fir (Abies) species, produce large amounts of oleoresin terpenoids as a defense against herbivores and pathogens. Due to the structural diversity of oleoresin terpenoids and their various chemical and physical properties, which range from solid and viscous resins to liquids and volatiles, many of these compounds are useful to humans for the production of therapeutics, fragrances and flavors, biofuels, and fine chemicals. In this chapter, we feature three examples of conifer terpenoids, the diterpene resin acids (DRA), the sesquiterpene E-a-bisabolene, and the diterpenol cis-abienol, to highlight the versatile utility of conifer terpenoids as renewable bioproducts. We focus on recent research progress on conifer terpene synthases (TPS) which produce a wealth of terpene scaffolds in nature. Our recent advances in conifer transcriptome and genome sequencing as well as metabolite analyses have accelerated discovery and definitive functional annotation of terpenoid pathway genes. New insights into the evolutionary diversification of conifer TPS, their modular organization, and dynamic expression will be fundamental to advance metabolic engineering and synthetic biology platforms for high-value terpenoids."
Bio-solar cell factories for photosynthetic isoprenoids production,Photosynthetic production of isoprenoids in cyanobacteria is considered in terms of metabolic engineering and biological importance.
Biosynthesis and Biological Functions of Terpenoids in Plants,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation MCB grant 0950865.
Biosynthesis and engineering of isoprenoid small molecules,"Isoprenoid secondary metabolites are a rich source of commercial products that have not been fully explored. At present, there are isoprenoid products used in cancer therapy, the treatment of infectious diseases, and crop protection. All isoprenoids share universal prenyl diphosphate precursors synthesized via two distinct pathways. From these universal precursors, the biosynthetic pathways to specific isoprenoids diverge resulting in a staggering array of products. Taking advantage of this diversity has been the focus of much effort in metabolic engineering heterologous hosts. In addition, the engineering of the mevalonate pathway has increased levels of the universal precursors available for heterologous production. Finally, we will describe the efforts to produce to commercial terpenoids, paclitaxel and artemisinin."
Biosynthesis and function of terpenoid defense compounds in maize (Zea mays),Maize produces an array of herbivore-induced terpene volatiles that attract parasitoids to infested plants and a suite of pathogen-induced non-volatile terpenoids with antimicrobial activity to defend against pests.
Biosynthesis of Carotenoids in Plants: Enzymes and Color,"Carotenoids are the most important biocolor isoprenoids responsible for yellow, orange and red colors found in nature. In plants, they are synthesized in plastids of photosynthetic and sink organs and are essential molecules for photosynthesis, photo-oxidative damage protection and phytohormone synthesis. Carotenoids also play important roles in human health and nutrition acting as vitamin A precursors and antioxidants. Biochemical and biophysical approaches in different plants models have provided significant advances in understanding the structural and functional roles of carotenoids in plants as well as the key points of regulation in their biosynthesis. To date, different plant models have been used to characterize the key genes and their regulation, which has increased the knowledge of the carotenoid metabolic pathway in plants. In this chapter a description of each step in the carotenoid synthesis pathway is presented and discussed."
Biosynthesis of Lower Terpenoids: Genetic and Physiological Controls in Woody Plants,"Biosynthesis of lower terpenoids has been studied in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) using three complementary approaches: (a) biochemistry, (b) electron microscopy, and (c) cell-free systems. Monoterpene hydrocarbon synthesis is performed by the transitory activity of a specific organelle—the leucoplast. Monogenic control of terpenes is expressed differently in primary and secondary structures. In needles, sesquiterpene production is continuous. The cyclization processes take place in endomembranes, presumably in the endoplasmic reticulum. The role of C10 and C15 acyclic compounds is demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro results. The existence of six major genes, each controlling the level of one terpene, has been demonstrated and some practical applications developed. The cell regulation of terpene biosynthesis is disturbed by various aggressions which induce either stimulation of quiescent specialized cells or delocalized synthesis."
Biosynthesis of Plant-Derived Odorants,"Plants produce thousands of structurally diverse volatile signal compounds to attract pollinating insects and seed dispersing animals. These compounds are often perceived by humans as a specific fruit or vegetable aroma. Many of these volatiles serve also as defense substances against fungi, bacteria, viruses, and herbivores. The knowledge of precursors and pathways leading to the formation of volatiles in fruits and vegetables has considerably progressed during the last years because of the use of molecular and biochemical techniques. In vitro characterization of the heterologously expressed enzymes has helped clarify the pathways of volatile formation. This chapter will, therefore, provide an overview of biosynthetic sequences and construction mechanisms that are illustrated in most cases using detailed reaction schemes. The various compounds are predominantly ordered according to the biosynthetic pathway that is used in plants to synthesize them and are grouped into carbohydrate-, lipid-, and amino-acid-derived odorants, terpenoids, and glycosidically bound odorants."
Biosynthesis of Sesquiterpene Lactones in Plants and Metabolic Engineering for Their Biotechnological Production,"In the present chapter, we review some aspects of the biosynthesis of sesquiterpene lactones and its regulation in different medicinal and aromatic plants used in the pharmaceutical industry. In this sense, we describe the mevalonate and the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathways, which generate the corresponding isoprenoid precursors (isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate), as well as the late pathways that lead to sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis. This chapter also analyses the role of the transcription factors involved in the regulation of sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis and the different biotechnological approaches that have been developed for sesquiterpene lactone production. In vitro plant cell cultures (comprising micropropagation and plant cell suspension, shoot and root cultures) have emerged as a production platform for many plant secondary metabolites, since they allow their production under controlled conditions and shorter production cycles. The characterisation and isolation of genes involved in the regulation of sesquiterpene lactone biosynthetic pathways have allowed the design of metabolic engineering strategies to increase the production of these metabolites. Moreover, we discuss different strategies to increase sesquiterpene lactone production through genetic engineering. We also focus on the metabolic engineering of the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway in Artemisia annua. This metabolic pathway has become a model system not only for the biotechnological production of sesquiterpene lactones but also for the improvement of other plant secondary metabolic pathways. Finally, we analyse the successful expression of the complete artemisinin biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has led to the efficient accumulation of artemisinic acid in these microorganisms."
Biosynthesis of Terpenoid Natural Products in Fungi,"Tens of thousands of terpenoid natural products have been isolated from plants and microbial sources. Higher fungi (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) are known to produce an array of well-known terpenoid natural products, including mycotoxins, antibiotics, antitumor compounds, and phytohormones. Except for a few well-studied fungal biosynthetic pathways, the majority of genes and biosynthetic pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of a small number of these secondary metabolites have only been discovered and characterized in the past 5–10 years. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on fungal terpenoid biosynthesis from biochemical, genetic, and genomic viewpoints. Enzymes involved in synthesizing, transferring, and cyclizing the prenyl chains that form the hydrocarbon scaffolds of fungal terpenoid natural products are systematically discussed. Genomic information and functional evidence suggest differences between the terpenome of the two major fungal phyla—the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota—which will be illustrated for each group of terpenoid natural products."
"Biosynthesis, accumulation and emission of carotenoids, a-tocopherol, plastoquinone, and isoprene in leaves under high photosynthetic irradiance","The localization of isoprenoid lipids in chloroplasts, the accumulation of particular isoprenoids under high irradiance conditions, and channelling of photosynthetically fixed carbon into plastidic thylakoid isoprenoids, volatile isoprenoids, and cytosolic sterols are reviewed. During leaf and chloroplast development in spring plastidic isoprenoid biosynthesis provides primarily thylakoid carotenoids, the phytyl side-chain of chlorophylls and the electron carriers phylloquinone K1, a-tocoquinone and a-tocopherol, as well as the nona-prenyl side-chain of plastoquinone-9. Under high irradiance, plants develop sun leaves and high light (HL) leaves with sun-type chloroplasts that possess, besides higher photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rates, different quantitative levels of pigments and prenylquinones as compared to shade leaves and low light (LL) leaves. After completion of chloroplast thylakoid synthesis plastidic isoprenoid biosynthesis continues at high irradiance conditions, constantly accumulating a-tocopherol (a-T) and the reduced form of plastoquinone-9 (PQ-9H2) deposited in the steadily enlarging osmiophilic plastoglobuli, the lipid reservoir of the chloroplast stroma. In sun leaves of beech (Fagus) and in 3-year-old sunlit Ficus leaves the level of a-T and PQ-9 can exceed that of chlorophyll b. Most plants respond to HL conditions (sun leaves, leaves suddenly lit by the sun) with a 1.4–2-fold increase of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids (violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin), an enhanced operation of the xanthophyll cycle and an increase of ß-carotene levels. This is documented by significantly lower values for the weight ratio chlorophylls to carotenoids (range: 3.6–4.6) as compared to shade and LL leaves (range: 4.8–7.0). Many plant leaves emit under HL and high temperature conditions at high rates the volatile compounds isoprene (broadleaf trees) or methylbutenol (American ponderosa pines), both of which are formed via the plastidic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-phosphate/2-C-methylerythritol 5-phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathway. Other plants by contrast, accumulate particular mono- and diterpenes. Under adequate photosynthetic conditions the chloroplastidic DOXP/MEP isoprenoid pathway essentially contributes, with its C5 isoprenoid precusors, to cytosolic sterol biosynthesis. The possible cross-talk between the two cellular isoprenoid pathways, the acetate/MVA and the DOXP/MEP pathways, that preferentially proceeds in a plastid-to-cytosol direction, is shortly discussed."
Biotechnological Approaches to Increase Essential Oil Yield and Quality in Aromatic Plants: The Lavandula latifolia (Spike Lavender) Example. Past and Recommendations for the Future,"Increasing knowledge about isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways has provided new tools for aromatic plant breeding using biotechnological approaches. Notably, there are possibilities to modify essential oil profiles and enhance production of valuable monoterpenes. This attains a particular significance in Lavandula latifolia Medik. (spike lavender), one of the most important essential oil crops in Spain. This chapter summarizes work done to improve essential oil yield and quality by engineering: (1) the enzymes controlling regulatory steps of methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) and mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways to increase C5 units employed for monoterpene biosynthesis and (2) the monoterpene synthases to produce changes in the qualitative profile of particular monoterpenes."
Biotechnological production of limonene in microorganisms,"This mini review describes novel, biotechnology-based, ways of producing the monoterpene limonene. Limonene is applied in relatively highly priced products, such as fragrances, and also has applications with lower value but large production volume, such as biomaterials. Limonene is currently produced as a side product from the citrus juice industry, but the availability and quality are fluctuating and may be insufficient for novel bulk applications. Therefore, complementary microbial production of limonene would be interesting. Since limonene can be derivatized to high-value compounds, microbial platforms also have a great potential beyond just producing limonene. In this review, we discuss the ins and outs of microbial limonene production in comparison with plant-based and chemical production. Achievements and specific challenges for microbial production of limonene are discussed, especially in the light of bulk applications such as biomaterials."
Calling in the Dark: The Role of Volatiles for Communication in the Rhizosphere,"Volatile organic compounds play an important role in the communication between plants and other organisms. The rhizosphere contains a large and diverse microbial community whose members use similar volatiles for intra- and interspecific communication. However, the analysis of volatiles produced in the rhizosphere and their ecological functions have been little explored so far. In this chapter, we outline what is known about the classes of volatiles that are emitted into the rhizosphere by roots and soil microbes, and the effect they have on different interactors in the soil. Additionally, we review current approaches to sample volatiles in mesocosms and field soils. We conclude that to better understand the production and functions of volatiles in the rhizosphere, it is of critical importance to design set-ups that account for the natural complexity of soils. This will help to apply this knowledge for sustainable agriculture and the identification of novel agrochemicals."
Cardamom Chemistry,"The chapter discusses, at length, the chemistry of cardamom, with special reference to the principal components of cardamom volatile oil, biosynthesis of flavor compounds, cardamom oleoresins, and extract. It also discusses biosynthesis of flavor compounds and evaluation of flavor quality."
Chapter 10 The Role of the Methyl-Erythritol-Phosphate (MEP)Pathway in Rhythmic Emission of Volatiles,"Plants release an array of terpenoid compounds including hemiterpenes, mono- and sesquiterpenes, irregular terpenes and some diterpenes throughout their life cycles. These secondary metabolites play crucial roles in pollinator attraction, defense, communication and interaction with the surrounding environment. Release of these compounds from flowers and undamaged and herbivore attacked leaves follows a rhythmic profile, which is induced by illumination and often controlled by a circadian clock. In plants two distinct biochemical pathways localized in different subcellular compartments, the cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and plastidial methyl-erythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway, are responsible for the biosynthesis of basic carbon building blocks for terpenoid compounds. Mounting evidence suggests that the flux through the MEP pathway changes rhythmically over a daily light/dark cycle peaking during the day. In this chapter we discuss the contribution of the MEP pathway to the rhythmic emission of terpenoids released from different plant tissues and the regulatory steps controlling the flux through this pathway."
Chapter 7 The Non-mevalonate DOXP/MEP (Deoxyxylulose 5-Phosphate/Methylerythritol 4-Phosphate) Pathway of Chloroplast Isoprenoid and Pigment Biosynthesis,"The plastidic pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and isoprenoid biosynthesis, the DOXP/MEP pathway, possesses an essential function in the biosynthesis of thylakoidal prenylllipids chlorophylls (phytyl side-chain), carotenoids, plastoquinone-9, phylloquinone K1 and a-tocopherol, as well as for monoterpenes and diterpenes. Here we review its detection, its enzymes, intermediates, genes, cofactor requirements and inhibitors. This plastidic isoprenoid pathway is also contrasted against the acetate/mevalonate(MVA) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis operating in the cytosol for the biosynthesis of sterols, sesquiterpenes and polyterpenes. The DOXP/MEP pathway can specifically be inhibited by fosmidomycin and the acetate/MVA pathway by statins (e.g. mevinolin). By applying specifically marked substrates (2H-deoxyxylulose, 14C-DOXP, 3H-MVA or 14C-MVA) and specific inhibitors a cross-talk between both IPP yielding cell pathways was detected that operates preferentially in the chloroplast-to-cytosol direction. The DOXP/MEP pathway is also involved in the biosynthesis of the volatile hemiterpenes isoprene and methylbutenol. The distribution of the DOXP/MEP pathway in photosynthetic organisms (bacteria, algae, higher plants) and its putative origin in anoxigenic photosynthetic bacteria is reviewed. The DOXP/MEP pathway does not occur in Archaea, fungi or animals. The use of etiolated seedlings with their light-induced pigment accumulation as a test system for inhibitors of the DOXP/MEP pathway in the search of active ingredients against pathogenic bacteria and the malaria parasite Plasmodium is discussed."
Chapter 8 The Methylerythritol 4-Phosphate Pathway: Regulatory Role in Plastid Isoprenoid Biosynthesis,"Plastids synthesize a variety of isoprenoid compounds that are essential for plant growth and development, like carotenoids, gibberellins, abscisic acid and the side chain of chlorophylls, plastoquinone and tocopherols. Some plastidial isoprenoids are also relevant for their biotechnological interest. The recently elucidated methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway provides the isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate required for the synthesis of plastidial isoprenoids. At present, very little is known about the regulatory mechanisms underlying the control of the metabolic flux through the MEP pathway and its crosstalk with the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Here I summarize recent aspects related to the regulatory role of the MEP pathway in the synthesis of plastidial isoprenoids and the use of reverse genetic strategies to study the crosstalk between the MVA and the MEP pathways."
"Characterization and functional analysis of the genes encoding 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, the two enzymes in the MEP pathway, from Amomum villosum Lour","A DXR gene, AvDXR (GenBank accession no. FJ459894), and a DXS gene, AvDXS (GenBank accession no. FJ455512), were isolated from the leaves of Amomum villosum, one of the most well-known and authentic herbs in South China. The 1,749-bp full-length cDNA of AvDXR encoded a peptide of 472 amino acids, and the 2,347-bp full-length cDNA of AvDXS encoded a peptide of 715 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequences of the AvDXR and AvDXS proteins share high homology with DXRs and DXSs from other plant species, and AvDXS belongs to class 1 plant DXS. The characterization based on bioinformatic analysis indicated that the AvDXR and AvDXS encoded functional proteins as DXR and DXS, respectively. The functional color assay in Escherichia coli with pAC-BETA implied that AvDXR and AvDXS encoded functional proteins that manipulated the biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors. Both AvDXR and AvDXS were expressed extensively in the leaves, stems, roots, pericarps and seeds of A. villosum. AvDXS expression was similar in all tissues investigated, whereas higher levels of AvDXR were observed in the fruits, the main part for the accumulation of volatile oil in this plant. AvDXR was transformed into tobacco to confirm its function further. Overexpression of AvDXR in transgenic T1 generation tobacco increased DXR activity, photosynthetic pigment content and volatile isoprenoid components, and the increase of photosynthetic pigment content was consistent with the AvDXR transcription level. This study demonstrated that AvDXR plays important role in isoprenoid biosynthesis and it is useful for metabolic engineering."
Chemical Characterization of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Through Headspace Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME),"Plants are able to store and emit a wide array of volatile organic compounds, also known as VOCs, which play a pivotal role in their interaction with the ecosystems. These VOCs, released as a mixture of lipophilic compounds with low molecular weight, are produced by different biosynthetic pathways and actively participate in plant defensive strategies against both abiotic and biotic stress factors. Among them, plant-plant interaction, the attraction of pollinators and/or parasitoids and the signaling between symbiont organisms, are the most documented. The development of techniques aimed in trapping, analyze, identify, and quantify plant volatiles, coupled to the evolution of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical methods, as well as the possibility to monitor in-vivo the changes in VOCs production, has significantly increased our knowledge concerning VOCs biosynthesis and their ecological role. This chapter will introduce an overview concerning the ecological role of plant volatiles as well as the biosynthetic pathways involved in their production. Moreover, it will describe the materials as well as the analytical steps that should be followed for static headspace VOCs analysis through solid-phase microextraction (SPME), which is one of the most common, repeatable and accepted technique."
"Cloning and characterization of a novel gene that encodes (S)-ß-bisabolene synthase from ginger, Zingiber officinale","Ginger, Zingiber officinale Roscoe, contains a fragrant oil mainly composed of sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. We isolated a cDNA that codes for a sesquiterpene synthase from young rhizomes of ginger, Z. officinale Roscoe, Japanese cultivar “Kintoki”. The cDNA, designated ZoTps1, potentially encoded a protein that comprised 550 amino acid residues and exhibited 49–53% identity with those of the sesquiterpene synthases already isolated from the genus Zingiber. Recombinant Escherichia coli cells, in which ZoTps1 was coexpressed along with genes for D-mevalonate utilization, resulted in the production of a sesquiterpene (S)-ß-bisabolene exclusively with a D-mevalonolactone supplement. This result indicated that ZoTps1 was the (S)-ß-bisabolene synthase gene in ginger. ZoTPS1 was suggested to catalyze (S)-ß-bisabolene formation with the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate to nerolidyl diphosphate followed by the cyclization between position 1 and 6 carbons. The ZoTps1 transcript was detected in young rhizomes, but not in leaves, roots and mature rhizomes of the ginger “Kintoki”."
Cloning and characterization of terpene synthase genes from Taiwan cherry,"Prunus campanulata Maxim. also known as Taiwan cherry is a broadleaf tree native to Taiwan and is highly valued as an ornamental tree. Terpenoids are one of the most important sources of plant secondary metabolites with many functions such as attracting pollinators, defending against herbivores, and acting as anti-bacterial agents. Here, the terpene synthases (TPSs) that produce small and volatile monoterpenes or sesquiterpenes were focused. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, we obtained nine full-length cDNAs from P. campanulata which were predicted to encode TPSs. The predicted proteins possessed typical characteristics of TPSs, such as the highly conserved RRX8W and DDXXD motifs. To identify the functions of these TPSs, the recombinant proteins were reacted with the substrate to produce corresponding monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Analysis results revealed that the eight TPSs produced their corresponding major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, except for one TPS gene that lacks a part of the N-terminus sequence. MeJA treatment (10 mM) resulted in differential expression of these nine TPSs, suggesting that they may have different regulation mechanisms with different functions in plants."
Computational Simulations for Cyclizations Catalyzed by Plant Monoterpene Synthases,"Metabolic pathways collectively define the biochemical repertory on an organism exposing the steps of its production. In silico metabolic pathways have been reconstructed using a wide range of computational methods. The reconstructed metabolic pathways can vary in some aspects, among which, in the context of this work, it is relevant to remark the data structure and granularity of biochemical details. Inferring chemical reactions using graph grammar rules is a method that exposes the initial, intermediates, and final products by modeling pathways over graphs and hypergraphs. Plant monoterpenes are volatile compounds with applications in industry, biotechnology, and medicine. They also play a vital ecological role. The last enzymatic reaction in the plant monoterpenes production chain is plentiful of possibilities due to the promiscuous nature of the terpene synthases (TPS), a case in which the application of inferring chemical reactions using graph grammar rules is suitable. In this work, we designed graph grammar rules that express cyclization reactions catalyzed by plant monoterpene synthases. As a result, it was generated a reachable chemical space of potential plant monoterpene blend, which can be computationally exploitable. In addition, these graph grammar rules were added to the 2Path, and a graphical interface was provided to aid the simulation code outlining.

"Investigating sesquiterpene biosynthesis in Ginkgo biloba: molecular cloning and functional characterization of (E,E)-farnesol and a-bisabolene synthases","
                        Ginkgo biloba is one of the oldest living tree species and has been extensively investigated as a source of bioactive natural compounds, including bioactive flavonoids, diterpene lactones, terpenoids and polysaccharides which accumulate in foliar tissues. Despite this chemical diversity, relatively few enzymes associated with any biosynthetic pathway from ginkgo have been characterized to date. In the present work, predicted transcripts potentially encoding enzymes associated with the biosynthesis of diterpenoid and terpenoid compounds, including putative terpene synthases, were first identified by mining publicly-available G. biloba RNA-seq data sets. Recombinant enzyme studies with two of the TPS-like sequences led to the identification of GbTPS1 and GbTPS2, encoding farnesol and bisabolene synthases, respectively. Additionally, the phylogenetic analysis revealed the two terpene synthase genes as primitive genes that might have evolved from an ancestral diterpene synthase."
Involvement of Compartmentalization in Monoterpene and Sesquiterpene Biosynthesis in Plants,"Terpenoids play numerous vital roles in basic plant processes with volatile monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes contributing to plant defense and reproduction. The biosynthesis of terpenoids in plants occurs in different subcellular compartments, which until recently were believed to include the cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria. The plastidic MEP pathway and the cytosolic MVA pathway give rise to IPP and DMAPP, which are subsequently utilized by prenyltransferases to produce prenyl diphosphates. It has been accepted that GPP and monoterpenes are synthesized in plastids, whereas FPP and sesquiterpenes are produced in the cytosol. Here we discuss how compartmentalization contributes to the formation of terpenoid diversity in plants in light of recent reports on new subcellular localizations for some enzymatic steps as well as on bifunctional terpene synthases capable of producing both mono- and sesquiterpenes."
Isopentenyl Diphosphate Isomerase (IPI) Gene Silencing Negatively Affects Patchouli Alcohol Biosynthesis in Pogostemon cablin,"Pogostemon cablin is a medicinally and economically important plant because it contains a high content of patchouli oil. Patchouli oil is composed of more than 24 unique sesquiterpene compounds, with the most abundant being patchouli alcohol (PA). PA is a sesquiterpene and is mainly synthesized through the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in plants in which isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPI) is a key enzyme. Here, a full-length cDNA encoding IPI (designated as PcIPI) was cloned from P. cablin through the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the full-length PcIPI includes an 879 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 292 amino acid protein with a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.55 and a molecular mass of 32.8 kDa. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that PcIPI shared the most recent genetic relationship with the IPI of Isodon rubescens (86.43%), Salvia miltiorrhiza (85.38%), Plectranthus barbatus (86.54%), and Prunella vulgaris (86.31%). To verify the function of the PcIPI gene in PA biosynthesis, the P. cablin plants were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens bearing a pTRV2-PcIPI construct to induce virus-mediated PcIPI silencing. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis were applied to detect changes in the PcIPI catalytic products and transcription levels. The trend of decreasing transcript level was found to be similar to that of decreasing sesquiterpene content. These results revealed that PcIPI silencing had a negative effect on PA biosynthesis."
"Isoprenoid Drugs, Biofuels, and Chemicals—Artemisinin, Farnesene, and Beyond","Isoprenoids have been identified and used as natural pharmaceuticals, fragrances, solvents, and, more recently, advanced biofuels. Although isoprenoids are most commonly found in plants, researchers have successfully engineered both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways to produce these valuable chemicals in microorganisms at high yields. The microbial synthesis of the precursor to artemisinin—an important antimalarial drug produced from the sweet wormwood Artemisia annua—serves as perhaps the most successful example of this approach. Through advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, microbial-derived semisynthetic artemisinin may soon replace plant-derived artemisinin as the primary source of this valuable pharmaceutical. The richness and diversity of isoprenoid structures also make them ideal candidates for advanced biofuels that may act as “drop-in” replacements for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Indeed, the sesquiterpenes farnesene and bisabolene, monoterpenes pinene and limonene, and hemiterpenes isopentenol and isopentanol have been evaluated as fuels or fuel precursors. As in the artemisinin project, these isoprenoids have been produced microbially through synthetic biology and metabolic engineering efforts. Here, we provide a brief review of the numerous isoprenoid compounds that have found use as pharmaceuticals, flavors, commodity chemicals, and, most importantly, advanced biofuels. In each case, we highlight the metabolic engineering strategies that were used to produce these compounds successfully in microbial hosts. In addition, we present a current outlook on microbial isoprenoid production, with an eye towards the many challenges that must be addressed to achieve higher yields and industrial-scale production.

"Isoprenoid Production via Plant Cell Cultures: Biosynthesis, Accumulation and Scaling-Up to Bioreactors","Plant cell culture is traditionally viewed as a unique artificially created biological system representing a heterogenous population of dedifferentiated cells. This system undergoes a continuous process of autoselection based on the intensity and stability of cell proliferation. We discuss here the details of formation and regulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis in plant cell in vitro based on literature survey and our research. Obviously, secondary metabolism differs in cell culture compared to the plant per se, because in cell culture metabolites are synthesized and compartmentalized within a single heterotrophic cell with sparse or underdeveloped vacuoles and plastids. For example, in plant cell cultures isoprenoid biosynthesis via MVA pathway was found to be more active than via plastid-localized MEP pathway. Also, it was hypothesized that cell cultures preferably produce metabolites, which promote cell proliferation and growth. Indeed, cell cultures of Dioscorea deltoidea produced mainly furostanol glycosides, which promoted cell division. Triterpene glycosides (ginsenosides) in the cell cultures of various Panax species are represented mainly by Rg- and Rb-groups. Rb ginsenosides are predominantly found as malonyl-esters that may influence their intracellular localization."
Isoprenoid-derived plant signaling molecules: biosynthesis and biological importance,The present review summarizes current knowledge of the biosynthesis and biological importance of isoprenoid-derived plant signaling compounds.
Leaf isoprene emission as a trait that mediates the growth-defense tradeoff in the face of climate stress,"Plant isoprene emissions are known to contribute to abiotic stress tolerance, especially during episodes of high temperature and drought, and during cellular oxidative stress. Recent studies have shown that genetic transformations to add or remove isoprene emissions cause a cascade of cellular modifications that include known signaling pathways, and interact to remodel adaptive growth-defense tradeoffs. The most compelling evidence for isoprene signaling is found in the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways, which produce salicylic acid, alkaloids, tannins, anthocyanins, flavonols and other flavonoids; all of which have roles in stress tolerance and plant defense. Isoprene also influences key gene expression patterns in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, and the jasmonic acid, gibberellic acid and cytokinin signaling networks that have important roles in controlling inducible defense responses and influencing plant growth and development, particularly following defoliation. In this synthesis paper, using past studies of transgenic poplar, tobacco and Arabidopsis, we present the evidence for isoprene acting as a metabolite that coordinates aspects of cellular signaling, resulting in enhanced chemical defense during periods of climate stress, while minimizing costs to growth. This perspective represents a major shift in our thinking away from direct effects of isoprene, for example, by changing membrane properties or quenching ROS, to indirect effects, through changes in gene expression and protein abundances. Recognition of isoprene's role in the growth-defense tradeoff provides new perspectives on evolution of the trait, its contribution to plant adaptation and resilience, and the ecological niches in which it is most effective."
MAIZE GENES INDUCED BY HERBIVORY AND VOLICITIN,"In crop plants, both mechanical damage and insect attack trigger rapid changes in gene transcription. We investigated whether insect herbivory differs from a general wound response, and if so, is the induction specific to the pest/host plant interaction? Herbivory by beet armyworm (BAW; Spodoptera exigua) caterpillars on maize results in a unique pattern of volatile compounds not triggered by wounding alone that attracts the generalist parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris. Caterpillar-induced volatile emission can be mimicked when a component of the BAW oral secretions (N-(17-hydroxylinolenoyl)-L-glutamine) termed volicitin, is applied to wounded leaves. We identified genes that are affected by BAW feeding by comparing volicitin treatment with wounding alone. We compared cDNAs from these two populations by isolating genes from a subtractive library and using reverse northerns. Virtual northern blots confirmed these results and further showed that BAW infestation affected the expression of these genes. In some cases, BAW feeding inhibited the expression of volicitin-induced genes, suggesting the role of additional bioactive components in caterpillar regurgitate. Transcripts involved in volatile production are increased by volicitin and BAW infestation treatments, and are also detectable at low levels in mechanically wounded leaves. Finally, we identified three new sesquiterpene cyclase genes that are induced by volicitin."
Metabolic and Gene Expression Controls on the Production of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds,"The emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), including isoprenoid compounds, methanol and oxygenated organic compounds, is controlled by both the existing metabolic potential of a leaf and gene expression responses that modulate the existing metabolic potential to increase or decrease compound biosynthesis and emission rate. This capability to respond both instantaneously and in the long term to environmental variation provides plants with flexibility in their adaptions to biotic and abiotic stresses, which are also encountered in short and long-term time frames. This chapter reviews the mechanistic basis of the immediate controls of volatile BVOC emissions by light, temperature, and ambient CO2 and O2 concentrations, as well as the genetic responses that involve changes in gene expression patterns. Photosynthesis ultimately provides the carbon for BVOC production, though under non-stressed conditions the photosynthetic rate itself is rarely so low that it limits BVOC emissions. However, various metabolic pathways compete for substrates that are produced from photosynthate, including cytosolic pathways, such as the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and chloroplastic pathways such as the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP). Controls over the use of substrate are regulated among these pathways through feedback mechanisms, specificity in the transport of metabolites across organelle membranes, and the channeling of NADPH reductant and ATP to specific steps in the pathways. This chapter emphasizes that these interactive controls provide the major explanation for longer-term physiological controls of emissions. Emissions of several types of compounds are considered, including isoprenoids, methanol, and green leaf volatiles such as various aldehydes and ketones."
Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology for isoprenoid production in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Isoprenoids, often called terpenoids, are the most abundant and highly diverse family of natural organic compounds. In plants, they play a distinct role in the form of photosynthetic pigments, hormones, electron carrier, structural components of membrane, and defence. Many isoprenoids have useful applications in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and chemical industries. They are synthesized by various isoprenoid synthase enzymes by several consecutive steps. Recent advancement in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology has enabled the production of these isoprenoids in the heterologous host systems like Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both heterologous systems have been engineered for large-scale production of value-added isoprenoids. This review article will provide the detailed description of various approaches used for engineering of methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) and mevalonate (MVA) pathway for synthesizing isoprene units (C5) and ultimate production of diverse isoprenoids. The review particularly highlighted the efforts taken for the production of C5–C20 isoprenoids by metabolic engineering techniques in E. coli and S. cerevisiae over a decade. The challenges and strategies are also discussed in detail for scale-up and engineering of isoprenoids in the heterologous host systems."
Metabolic engineering for the microbial production of carotenoids and related products with a focus on the rare C50 carotenoids,"Carotenoids, a subfamily of terpenoids, are yellow- to red-colored pigments synthesized by plants, fungi, algae, and bacteria. They are ubiquitous in nature and take over crucial roles in many biological processes as for example photosynthesis, vision, and the quenching of free radicals and singlet oxygen. Due to their color and their potential beneficial effects on human health, carotenoids receive increasing attention. Carotenoids can be classified due to the length of their carbon backbone. Most carotenoids have a C40 backbone, but also C30 and C50 carotenoids are known. All carotenoids are derived from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) as a common precursor. Pathways leading to IPP as well as metabolic engineering of IPP synthesis and C40 carotenoid production have been reviewed expertly elsewhere. Since C50 carotenoids are synthesized from the C40 carotenoid lycopene, we will summarize common strategies for optimizing lycopene production and we will focus our review on the characteristics, biosynthesis, glycosylation, and overproduction of C50 carotenoids."

Metabolism of Acyclic Terpenes by Pseudomonas,"
              Pseudomonas is a highly versatile bacterial genus with the ability to grow on a wide diversity of organic compounds. The compounds that can be used as a carbon and energy source include root exudates of plants such as sugars, amino acids, and organic acids, animals in putrefaction steps, and other contaminant compounds [1]. Pseudomonas species are found in pristine waters, wild soils and extreme habitats."
Metabolomics-Based Studies on Artemisinin Biosynthesis,"
            Artemisia annua L. is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant. In the 1970s, Chinese scientists first isolated colorless needle-like crystals with antimalarial activity from A. annua and named artemisinin. The chemical structure of artemisinin was confirmed as a sesquiterpene lactone with an endoperoxide bridge, of melting point 156–157 °C and molecular formula C15H22O5."
"Microbial Production, Extraction, and Quantitative Analysis of Isoprenoids","Isoprenoids, also known as terpenes or terpenoids, are compounds made of one or more isoprene (C5H8) moieties and constitute the largest class of natural products. They play diverse roles in biology and have broad industrial uses as flavors, fragrances, biofuels, polymers, agricultural chemicals, and medicines. Most isoprenoids are secondary plant metabolites and only produced in very low amounts. To make these valuable compounds economically accessible, significant efforts in the culture and engineering of microbial cells for isoprenoid biosynthesis have been made in the last decades. The protocols presented here describe lab-scale cultivation of microbes, either naturally producing or engineered, for isoprenoid production, the extraction of products and their quantification by high-performance liquid chromatography. Examples of isoprenoids covered in this chapter include (C10) mono-, (C15) sesqui-, (C20) di-, (C30) tri-, and (C40) tetraterpenoids. We focus on yeast and cyanobacteria as production systems, but the protocols can be adapted for other organisms."
Molecular and Pathway Controls on Biogenic Volatile Organic Compound Emissions,"Plants make a number of volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), many of which are emitted in a light- and temperature-dependent manner. The vast majority of these BVOCs are isoprenoids including isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. The total BVOC flux into the atmosphere is on the order of a petagram (1015 g) and has multiple effects on atmospheric chemistry. Understanding the biochemical and molecular regulation of BVOC emissions allows us to build prediction models that better reflect the underlying physiological and biochemical processes. In this chapter we review the enzymes and pathways involved in the biosynthesis of various BVOCs that originate from plants, using isoprene as a model. The biochemical and molecular control of BVOC emission in response to short-term environment drivers such as temperature, light, CO2, and O2, and long-term factors such as circadian, seasonal, and developmental effects are discussed. An emerging theme in the regulation of isoprene emission is that the enzyme isoprene synthase controls the basal emission rate in the long term, while the responses of isoprene emission to short-term factors are regulated by levels of the substrate (dimethylallyl diphosphate), which is in turn determined by upstream enzymes. In addition, we propose a new hypothesis to explain the high-CO2 suppression of isoprene emission. At high CO2 concentrations, a high cytosolic inorganic phosphate (Pi) gradient needed to transport triose phosphates out of the chloroplasts could work against the transport of phosphoenol pyruvate into the chloroplasts. This altered partitioning of phosphoenol pyruvate would then reduce the supply of pyruvate into the MEP pathway. Much work is still needed to understand the CO2 response of BVOC emissions but we expect to see significant progress in the near future."
Molecular Engineering of Monoterpene Production,"The terpenoids (often referred to as isoprenoids) constitute the largest group of natural products, with more than 22, 000 individual structures now known (1). They are all derived from the sequential addition of branched, five-carbon isopentenoid (isoprenoid) units, and range in size from isoprene (C5H8) to natural rubber (molecular weight greater than 106). In plants, the terpenoids and meroterpenoids (in which the terpenoid comprises a part of a larger molecule) play a broad range of metabolic and physiological roles, for example in photosynthesis (chlorophyll side chains, carotenoids, phylloquinones, plastoquinones), respiration (ubiquinone), cell membrane architecture (sterols), regulation of growth and development (gibberellins, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids), defense mechanisms (as phytoalexins, insect feeding and oviposition deterrents, competitive phytotoxins), and reproduction (as attractants of pollinators and seed dispersing animals). Additionally, isoprenylation of proteins by addition of a C15 or C20 olefinic chain provides a means of membrane anchoring, for example of cell cycle-regulating proteins. In this chapter, we focus on one family of industrially and agronomically significant plant terpenoids, the monoterpenes, and on the potential for the molecular genetic manipulation of the biosynthesis of this group of C10 compounds formed by the head-to-tail condensation of two isoprenoid units."
Monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in glandular trichomes of peppermint (Mentha x piperita) rely exclusively on plastid-derived isopentenyl diphosphate,"The subcellular compartmentation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) synthesis was examined in secretory cells isolated from glandular trichomes of peppermint (Mentha x piperita L. cv. Black Mitcham). As a consequence of their anatomy and the conditions of their isolation, the isolated secretory cells are non-specifically permeable to low-molecular-weight water-soluble metabolites. Thus, the cytoplasm is readily accessible to the exogenous buffer whereas the selective permeability of subcellular organelles is maintained. With the appropriate choice of exogenous substrates, this feature allows the assessment of cytoplasmic and organellar (e.g. plastidic) metabolism in situ. Glycolytic substrates such as [14C]glucose-6-phosphate and [14C]pyruvic acid are incorporated into both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes with a monoterpene:sesquiterpene ratio that closely mimics that observed in vivo, indicating that the correct subcellular partitioning of these substrates is maintained in this model system. Additionally, exogenous [14C]mevalonic acid and [14C]IPP, which are both intitially metabolized in the cytoplasm, produce an abnormally high proportion of sesquiterpenes. In contrast, incubation with either [14C]citrate or [14C]acetyl-CoA results in the accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) with no detectable isoprenoids formed. Taken together, these results indicate that the cytoplasmic mevalonic acid pathway is blocked at HMG-CoA reductase and that the IPP utilized for both monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis is synthesized exclusively in the plastids."
Mouse lipogenic proteins promote the co-accumulation of triacylglycerols and sesquiterpenes in plant cells,Mouse FIT2 protein redirects the cytoplasmic terpene biosynthetic machinery to lipid-droplet-forming domains in the ER and this relocalization supports the efficient compartmentalization and accumulation of sesquiterpenes in plant cells.
Natural Products: An Alternative to Conventional Therapy for Dermatophytosis?,"The increased incidence of fungal infections, associated with the widespread use of antifungal drugs, has resulted in the development of resistance, making it necessary to discover new therapeutic alternatives. Among fungal infections, dermatophytoses constitute a serious public health problem, affecting 20–25 % of the world population. Medicinal plants represent an endless source of bioactive molecules, and their volatile and non-volatile extracts are clearly recognized for being the historical basis of therapeutic health care. Because of this, the research on natural products with antifungal activity against dermatophytes has considerably increased in recent years. However, despite the recognized anti-dermatophytic potential of natural products, often advantageous face to commercial drugs, there is still a long way to go until their use in therapeutics. This review attempts to summarize the current status of anti-dermatophytic natural products, focusing on their mechanism of action, the developed pharmaceutical formulations and their effectiveness in human and animal models of infection."
Novel approaches and achievements in biosynthesis of functional isoprenoids in Escherichia coli,"Isoprenoids, also referred to as terpenes, are the most diverse class of natural products appearing in a variety of natural sources, specifically in higher plants, and have a wide range of biological functions. This review describes novel or recent approaches and achievements in pathway engineering of Escherichia coli towards efficient biosynthesis of functional isoprenoids, specifically carotenoids and sesquiterpene, following description of “regularity and simplicity” in the biosynthesis of isoprenoid basic structures. The introduction of heterologous mevalonate pathway-based genes into E. coli has been shown to improve the productivity of carotenoids or sesquiterpenes that are synthesized from farnesyl diphosphate. This achievement also enables relevant researchers to efficiently analyze an isolated gene candidate for a terpene synthase (terpene cyclase)."
On the Evolution and Functional Diversity of Terpene Synthases in the Pinus Species: A Review,"In the biosynthesis of terpenoids, the ample catalytic versatility of terpene synthases (TPS) allows the formation of thousands of different molecules. A steadily increasing number of sequenced plant genomes invariably show that the TPS gene family is medium to large in size, comprising from 30 to 100 functional members. In conifers, TPSs belonging to the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily produce a complex mixture of mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenoid specialized metabolites, which are found in volatile emissions and oleoresin secretions. Such substances are involved in the defence against pathogens and herbivores and can help to protect against abiotic stress. Oleoresin terpenoids can be also profitably used in a number of different fields, from traditional and modern medicine to fine chemicals, fragrances, and flavours, and, in the last years, in biorefinery too. In the present work, after summarizing the current views on the biosynthesis and biological functions of terpenoids, recent advances on the evolution and functional diversification of plant TPSs are reviewed, with a focus on gymnosperms. In such context, an extensive characterization and phylogeny of all the known TPSs from different Pinus species is reported, which, for such genus, can be seen as the first effort to explore the evolutionary history of the large family of TPS genes involved in specialized metabolism. Finally, an approach is described in which the phylogeny of TPSs in Pinus spp. has been exploited to isolate for the first time mono-TPS sequences from Pinus nigra subsp. laricio, an ecologically important endemic pine in the Mediterranean area."
Plant Secondary Metabolites: Functions in Plants and Pharmacological Importance,"Plant secondary metabolites are the organic compounds that are not necessary for growth or reproduction of plants, but which can be demonstrated genetically, physiologically, or biochemically. Of the estimated 400,000–500,000 plant species, only a small percentage has been investigated for their ethanopharmacological value, and even a lower fraction has been exploited to get the active pharmaceutical ingredients. Studies have revealed that the ability of plants to synthesize secondary metabolites is directly related to their course of evolution, and these metabolites fulfill physiological needs of plants such as attracting pollinators, protecting from pests and pathogens, enabling the plant to tolerate environmental stress, etc. The evolution of secondary metabolism is primarily from the primary metabolism by alterations in certain enzymes and pathways. This chapter provides an overview of the diversity of plant secondary metabolites in terms of their structure, function, and biosynthesis. Further research is needed to understand the chemical interactions between different plant species, and between plants and other organisms so that the potential secondary metabolites can be traced for novel uses by mankind."
Overexpression of Panax ginseng sesquiterpene synthase gene confers tolerance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Sesquiterpenes are an abundant group belonging to the terpenoid family, with a C15 structure comprise of three isoprene units. Many sesquiterpenes are volatile compounds and it act as chemical messenger in plant signalling, particularly in the defense mechanism against biotic and abiotic stresses. Panax ginseng Meyer is important medicinal herbs with various reported pharmacological efficacies in which its triterpenoid saponins, called ginsenosides, were mostly studied. However, there have been few studies on volatile sesquiterpenes compounds regulation on P. ginseng. As slow-growing perennial plant, P. ginseng received many kind of stresses during its cultivation. The pathogen attack is one of the most devastated perturbation for ginseng yield. Thus, we aimed to analyze P. ginseng STS gene (PgSTS) expressions in ginseng organs as well as mono-, sesquiterpenes contents from ginseng seedlings treated with elicitors. qRT-PCR and GC-MS analysis showed that two elicitors- salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) triggered PgSTS expression at different time points and significantly induced mono-, sesquiterpene yield. Overexpression of PgSTS in Arabidopsis also induced high terpene content and conferred tolerance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato infection. These results suggested that PgSTS transcripts are involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in response to environmental stress mediated by MeJA and SA elicitors; thus, generate tolerance against pathogen attack."
Ozone-Induced Changes in Plant Secondary Metabolism,"In their ecosystem, plants have to cope with a plethora of potentially unfavourable conditions. Stress factors affecting plant’s fitness not only derive from natural sources, such as adverse temperature fluctuations (heating, chilling and freezing), high irradiance (photoinhibition, photooxidation), osmotic imbalance (salinity and drought), hypoxia/anoxia (flooding), mineral (macro- and micronutrient) deficiency, wounding, phytophagy and pathogen attack, but also from anthropogenic activities. The latter include xenobiotics employed in agriculture (herbicide, pesticides and fungicides), environmental (air, soil and water) pollutants and increased UV radiations. Particularly, many atmospheric pollutants, belonging to greenhouse gases, may increase the greenhouse effect, a natural warming process that prevents heat from diffusing to the outer atmosphere, thus balancing Earth cooling processes. Without the natural greenhouse effect, temperature on Earth would be much lower than it is now, and the existence of life would have not been possible. However, the rising emissions of greenhouse gases due to anthropogenic activities, namely carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), nitrous oxide (N2O), tropospheric ozone (O3) and water vapour, may cause a short-term increase of the mean global temperature on the planet surface with consequent changes in precipitation patterns (Krupa and Kickert 1989). In this scenario, life on the earth depended from the co-evolution between atmosphere and biosphere, because the gradual and long-term climate changes enabled living organism adaptation to the new temperatures, precipitation patterns and other climate conditions (Voronin and Black 2007)."
Paradigm of Monoterpene (ß-phellandrene) Hydrocarbons Production via Photosynthesis in Cyanobacteria,"A direct “photosynthesis-to-fuels” approach envisions application of a single organism, absorbing sunlight, photosynthesizing, and converting the primary products of photosynthesis into ready-made fuel. The work reported here applied this concept for the photosynthetic generation of monoterpene (ß-phellandrene) hydrocarbons in the unicellular cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Heterologous expression of a codon-optimized Lavandula angustifolia ß-phellandrene synthase (ß-PHLS) gene in Synechocystis enabled photosynthetic generation of ß-phellandrene in these microorganisms. ß-phellandrene accumulation occurred constitutively and in tandem with biomass accumulation, generated from sunlight, CO2, and H2O. Results showed that ß-phellandrene diffused through the plasma membrane and cell wall of the cyanobacteria and accumulated on the surface of the liquid culture. Spontaneous ß-phellandrene separation from the biomass and its removal from the liquid phase alleviated product inhibition of cellular metabolism and enabled a continuous production process. The work showed that oxygenic photosynthesis can be directed to generate monoterpene hydrocarbons, while consuming CO2, without a prior requirement for the harvesting, dewatering, and processing of the respective biomass."
"Pathways for Carotenoid Biosynthesis, Degradation, and Storage","Carotenoids are isoprenoid compounds synthesized de novo in all photosynthetic organisms as well as in some nonphotosynthetic bacteria and fungi. In plants, carotenoids are essential for light harvesting and photoprotection. They contribute to the vivid color found in many plant organs. The cleavage of carotenoids produces small molecules (apocarotenoids) that serve as aroma compounds, as well as phytohormones and signals to affect plant growth and development. Since carotenoids provide valuable nutrition and health benefits for humans, understanding of carotenoid biosynthesis, catabolism and storage is important for biofortification of crops with improved nutritional quality. This chapter primarily introduces our current knowledge about carotenoid biosynthesis and degradation pathways as well as carotenoid storage in plants."
Plant geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases: every (gene) family has a story,"Plant isoprenoids (also known as terpenes or terpenoids) are a wide family of primary and secondary metabolites with multiple functions. In particular, most photosynthesis-related isoprenoids (including carotenoids and chlorophylls) as well as diterpenes and polyterpenes derive from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) produced by GGPP synthase (GGPPS) enzymes in several cell compartments. Plant genomes typically harbor multiple copies of differentially expressed genes encoding GGPPS-like proteins. While sequence comparisons allow to identify potential GGPPS candidates, experimental evidence is required to ascertain their enzymatic activity and biological function. Actually, functional analyses of the full set of potential GGPPS paralogs are only available for a handful of plant species. Here we review our current knowledge on the GGPPS families of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop species rice (Oryza sativa), pepper (Capsicum annuum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The results indicate that a major determinant of the biological role of particular GGPPS paralogs is the expression profile of the corresponding genes even though specific interactions with other proteins (including GGPP-consuming enzymes) might also contribute to subfunctionalization. In some species, however, a single GGPPS isoforms appears to be responsible for the production of most if not all GGPP required for cell functions. Deciphering the mechanisms regulating GGPPS activity in particular cell compartments, tissues, organs and plant species will be very useful for future metabolic engineering approaches aimed to manipulate the accumulation of particular GGPP-derived products of interest without negatively impacting the levels of other isoprenoids required to sustain essential cell functions."
"Plant terpenes: defense responses, phylogenetic analysis, regulation and clinical applications","The terpenoids constitute the largest class of natural products and many interesting products are extensively applied in the industrial sector as flavors, fragrances, spices and are also used in perfumery and cosmetics. Many terpenoids have biological activities and also used for medical purposes. In higher plants, the conventional acetate-mevalonic acid pathway operates mainly in the cytosol and mitochondria and synthesizes sterols, sesquiterpenes and ubiquinones mainly. In the plastid, the non-mevalonic acid pathway takes place and synthesizes hemi-, mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes along with carotenoids and phytol tail of chlorophyll. In this review paper, recent developments in the biosynthesis of terpenoids, indepth description of terpene synthases and their phylogenetic analysis, regulation of terpene biosynthesis as well as updates of terpenes which have entered in the clinical studies are reviewed thoroughly."
Production of (+)-valencene in the mushroom-forming fungus S. commune,"Production of commercially interesting sesquiterpenes was previously examined in plants and microorganisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We here investigate the potential of the mushroom Schizophyllum commune for the production of sesquiterpenes. Genomic analysis of S. commune revealed that the mevalonate pathway required for the synthesis of the farnesyl diphosphate substrate for sesquiterpene production is operational. Introduction of a valencene synthase gene resulted in production of the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene, both in mycelium and in fruiting bodies. Levels of (+)-valencene in culture media of strains containing a mutated RGS regulatory protein gene (thn) were increased fourfold compared to those in wild-type transformants. Up to 16 mg L-1 (+)-valencene was produced in these strains. In addition, the amount of (+)-valencene containing n-dodecane recovered from the culture medium increased sixfold to sevenfold in the thn mutant strains due to the absence of schizophyllan."
Production of artemisinin by genetically-modified microbes,"Artemisinin, an endoperoxidized sesquiterpene originally extracted from the medicinal plant Artemisia annua L., is a potent malaria-killing agent. Due to the urgent demand and short supply of this new antimalarial drug, engineering enhanced production of artemisinin by genetically-modified or transgenic microbes is currently being explored. Cloning and expression of the artemisinin biosynthetic genes in Saccharomyces
                        cerevisiae and Escherichia coli have led to large-scale microbial production of the artemisinin precursors such as amorpha-4,11-diene and artemisinic acid. Although reconstruction of the complete biosynthetic pathway toward artemisinin in transgenic yeast and bacteria has not been achieved, artemisinic acid available from these transgenic microbes facilitates the subsequent partial synthesis of artemisinin by either chemical or biotransformational process, thereby providing an attractive strategy alternative to the direct extraction of artemisinin from A.annua L. In this review, we update the current trends and summarize the future prospects on genetic engineering of the microorganisms capable of accumulating artemisinin precursors through heterologous and functional expression of the artemisinin biosynthetic genes."
Production of Industrially Relevant Isoprenoid Compounds in Engineered Microbes,"Isoprenoids are the largest class of natural compounds and have extremely diverse chemical and functional properties. They are involved in many different cellular processes, including hormonal regulation, signalling, pest/pathogen defence and redox status. They also provide many of the colours, flavours and aromas found in biology. The diversity of isoprenoids lends them to a wide variety of biotechnological applications, both by exploiting their myriad natural functions and by using them as industrial chemicals/chemical feedstocks. These applications range from fine chemicals (pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, antimicrobials) through mid-volume (flavours, fragrances, colourants, fuel additives) and bulk (fuels, synthetic polymers, agricultural chemicals, etc.) products. However, in their natural context, individual isoprenoids are not usually found at sufficient abundance for industrial use. Moreover, extraction and/or purification may be difficult and/or expensive, or production may be highly variable, making industrial production processes challenging or impossible. Artificial synthesis is often not possible due to complexity, expense or other chemical properties/requirements. Consequently, there is a strong movement towards bioengineering of microbes for production of these valuable compounds in controlled fermentation conditions. Here we consider the requirements for developing economically viable isoprenoid production bioprocesses as well as the current state of the art in engineering production in microbes. We also discuss some of the challenges we face in bringing these technologies to the market."

"
Production of terpenes and terpenoids,"The best-studied routes of isoprenoid biosynthesis are those of vertebrates, where terpenes and terpenoids are generally produced via the mevalonate metabolism. Throughout this book we will refer to it as the mevalonate-dependent route (MAD route). The biosynthesis of mevalonic acid, which is their precursor, is governed by at least four different enzymes: acetyl-CoA thiolase, HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA cyclase and HMG-CoA reductase. The latter enzyme that reduces ß-hydroxy-ß-methylglutaryl CoA to mevalonic acid (MVA) (Box 2.1) is a key enzyme in the production of MVA and isoprenoid groups."
Protocols for the Production and Analysis of Isoprenoids in Bacteria and Yeast,"Isoprenoids (a.k.a. terpenes/terpenoids) are the largest group of natural products. They fulfil a wide variety of both essential and non-essential roles in biology; many isoprenoids also have useful industrial applications. In recent years, there has been a significant focus on metabolic engineering of various isoprenoids in microbial cells. Here, we describe methods for lab-scale culturing, sampling and analytics of different isoprenoid classes using specific examples from the following classes: (1) highly volatile isoprenoids that sequester into culture headspaces, e.g. the hemiterpene isoprene; (2) volatile isoprenoids that can be collected in a non-toxic organic phase, e.g. the monoterpene limonene; and (3) non-volatile isoprenoids that accumulate in the cell, e.g. the carotenoid lycopene. Production methods are provided for isoprene, limonene, and lycopene as examples for each class. Specific analytical methods are provided for isoprene, limonene, terpinolene, caryophyllene, amorphadiene, linalool, nerolidol, pinene and lycopene. We focus on yeast and Escherichia coli as production organisms. The protocols can be modified for other organisms and products as appropriate."
Quantitative assessment of crosstalk between the two isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways in plants by NMR spectroscopy,"Plants have been shown to use the mevalonate pathway for the biosynthesis of sterols and triterpenes in the cytoplasm and the recently discovered deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway for the biosynthesis of a variety of hemiterpenes, monoterpenes, diterpenes, as well as for the biosynthesis of carotenoids and the phytol side chain of chlorophyll in plastids. Despite the compartmental separation, at least one terpene precursor can be exchanged between the two pathways. In order to assess quantitatively the crosstalk between the two isoprenoid pathways, [2-13C1]mevalonolactone or [U-13C6]glucose were supplied to cell cultures of Catharanthus roseus grown under illumination or in darkness. Sitosterol, lutein and phytol were isolated and analysed by NMR spectroscopy. The incorporations of exogenous [2-13C1]mevalonolactone were 48% and 7% into the DMAPP and IPP precursors of sitosterol and lutein, respectively. With [U-13C6]glucose as precursor, at least 95% of sitosterol precursors were obtained via the mevalonate pathway, whereas phytol appeared to be biosynthesised via the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway (approximately 60%) as well via the mevalonate pathway (approximately 40%). The apparent ratios for the contribution of the two pathways depend on the nature of the precursor supplied as well as the nature of the target compound. Thus, crosstalk between the two terpenoid pathways cannot be explained in detail by a simple two compartment model and requires an additional in depth study of complex regulatory mechanisms."
Quantitative trait loci for foliar terpenes in a global eucalypt species,"Terpenes are a diverse group of plant secondary metabolites that mediate a plethora of ecological interactions in many plant species. Despite increasing research into the genetic control of important adaptive traits in some plant species, the genetic control of terpenes in forest tree species is still relatively poorly studied. In this study, we use quantitative genetic and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis to investigate the genetic control of foliar terpenes in an ecologically and commercially important eucalypt species, Eucalyptus globulus. We show a moderate to high within-family broad-sense heritability and significant genetic basis to the variation in 14 of the 16 terpenes assayed. This is the first report of QTL for terpenes in this species. Eleven QTL influenced the terpenes overall. One QTL on linkage group 6 affected six of the seven different sesquiterpenes assayed (plus one monoterpene), which, in combination with highly significant correlations between these compounds, argues that their variation is influenced by a QTL with pleiotropic effect early in the biosynthetic pathway. We examine the homology of these QTL to those found in a closely related eucalypt, Eucalyptus nitens, and provide evidence that both common and unique QTL influence terpene levels."
Regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis by miRNA in Persicaria minor induced by Fusarium oxysporum,"Persicaria minor (kesum) is an herbaceous plant with a high level of secondary metabolite compounds, particularly terpenoids. These terpenoid compounds have well-established roles in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Although the terpenoids of P. minor have been studied thoroughly, the involvement of microRNA (miRNA) in terpenoid regulation remains poorly understood and needs to be explored. In this study, P. minor plants were inoculated with the pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum for terpenoid induction."
Responses of Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon roots to the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Funneliformis mosseae and the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Ensifer meliloti include changes in volatile organic compounds,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are beneficial microorganisms that may associate with grapevine roots, improving stress tolerance, growth, and nutrition. AM fungi and PGPR enhance the production of plant secondary metabolites, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that play a key role in the interaction of plants with the environment and are involved in defence mechanisms. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of an AM fungus and a rhizobacterium on plant growth and VOCs in Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon roots to gain insight into the potential role of plant-rhizosphere microorganisms in vine growth and defence. Grapevines were inoculated or not with the AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae IN101 and/or the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Ensifer meliloti TSA41. Both microbial strains enhanced plant growth. Fifty-eight VOCs extracted from ground roots were identified using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. VOCs were induced by F. mosseae IN101, increasing up to 87% compared with control plants. Monoterpenes were strongly enhanced by F. mosseae IN101, increasing up to 113% compared with control plants. Interestingly, monoterpene alcohols related to plant defence, such as myrtenol, p-cymen-7-ol, and p-mentha-1.8-dien-7-ol were increased. By contrast, E. meliloti TSA41 did not significantly affect VOCs. The knowledge of the effects of AM fungi and PGPR on grapevine VOCs may contribute to an integrated and sustainable management of vineyards."
Rice terpene synthase 20 (OsTPS20) plays an important role in producing terpene volatiles in response to abiotic stresses,"This study examined the volatile terpenes produced by rice seedlings in response to oxidative stress induced by various abiotic factors. Solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME–GC–MS) analyses revealed that when exposed to UV-B radiation, rice seedlings emitted a bouquet of monoterpene mixtures in a time-dependent manner. The mixtures comprised limonene, sabinene, myrcene, a-terpinene, ß-ocimene, ?-terpinene, and a-terpinolene. Among them, (S)-limonene was the most abundant volatile, discriminated by chiral SPME–GC–MS. The volatile profiles collected from rice plants treated with both ?-irradiation and H2O2 were identical to those observed in the UV-B irradiated plants, thus indicating that the volatile mixtures were specifically produced in response to oxidative stress, particularly in the presence of H2O2. Using a reverse genetics approach, we isolated full-length rice terpene synthase 20 (OsTPS20, 599 amino acids, 69.39 kDa), which was further characterized as an (S)-limonene synthase by removing the N-terminal signal peptide (63 amino acids) of the protein. The recombinant OsTPS20 protein catalyzed the conversion of geranyl diphosphate to (S)-limonene and other minor monoterpenes, essentially covering all of the volatile compounds detected from the plant. Moreover, qRT-PCR revealed that the transcript levels of OsTPS20 were significantly induced in response to oxidative stress, thereby suggesting that OsTPS20 plays a major role in producing terpene volatiles during abiotic stress. Detailed biochemical analyses and the unusual domain characteristics of OsTPS20 are also discussed in this report."
Role of Global Warming and Plant Signaling in BVOC Emissions,"Plants emit a substantial amount of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) into the atmosphere having significant effects on atmospheric chemistry, physics, and the organisms. In this chapter, important facts about BVOCs’ production mechanism, storage, and emissions due to various abiotic and biotic factors have been discussed. The role of BVOCs in defense system through plant signaling has also been discussed. The chapter continues with the discussions about the importance of BVOCs in the formation of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosols and ultimately strengthens our understanding about global change research."
Role of Plant Peroxisomes in Protection Against Herbivores,"Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles of vital importance. They are ubiquitous, have a single membrane and execute numerous metabolic reactions in plants. Plant peroxisomes are multifaceted and have diverse functions including, but not limited to, photomorphogenesis, lipid metabolism, photorespiration, nitrogen metabolism, detoxification and plant biotic interactions. Plants have evolved a variety of defence barriers against herbivory. These barriers are unique and loaded with various metabolites. Peroxisomes play an important role in cells, maintaining the compartmentation of certain specific reactions. They serve as a first line of defence, as peroxisomes generate primary signals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Both ROS and RNS sense the invasion by herbivores and dramatically reshape the plant transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes, so indicating the importance of signals generated by peroxisomes. Peroxisomes also store a plethora of important enzymes, which have a key role in producing defence molecules. Some of the main enzymes in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids are present in peroxisomes. These enzymes generate plant volatiles, which have numerous functions and important roles in plant-herbivore communication."
Role of Secondary Metabolites and Brassinosteroids in Plant Defense Against Environmental Stresses,"Being sessile, plants are subjected to a diverse array of environmental stresses during their life span. Exposure of plants to environmental stresses results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These activated oxygen species tend to oxidize various cellular biomolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, a process that challenges the core existence of the cell. To prevent the accumulation of these ROS and to sustain their own survival, plants have developed an intricate antioxidative defence system. The antioxidative defence system comprises various enzymatic and nonenzymatic molecules, produced to counter the adverse effect of environmental stresses. A sizable number of these molecules belong to the category of compounds called secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the growth and development of plants but perform specialized functions under a given set of conditions. Absence of secondary metabolites results in long-term impairment of the plant’s survivability. Such compounds generally include pigments, phenolics, and so on. Plant phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and lignin precursors have been reported to accumulate in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses and are regarded as crucial defence compounds that can scavenge harmful ROS. Another important category of plant metabolites, called brassinosteroids, exhibit stress regulatory and growth-promoting activity and are classified as phytohormones. Elucidation of the physiological and molecular effects of secondary metabolites and brassinosteroids have catapulted them as highly promising and environment-friendly natural substances, suitable for wider application in plant protection and crop yield promotion. The present review focuses on our current understanding of how plants respond to the generation of excessive ROS and the role of secondary metabolites and brassinosteroids in countering the adverse effects of environmental stresses."
Signalling During Insect Plant Interaction,"Insects and plants share refined interactions as plants recognize insects via mechanical and chemical hints. The initial response begins at plant cell membrane. Insects interact physically with the membrane and triggers production of signalling molecules in the plant. Herbivore contact causes charge distribution differences across the membrane which eventually leads to calcium signalling cascade. Generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species also follows membrane depolarization. Multiple hormone response pathways leads to appropriate responses, but the primary signalling cassette mediating the information received at the plant-insect interface and starting defence responses in plants is the jasmonate (JA) pathway. Defence responses are initiated by the accumulation of several secondary metabolites and defence proteins. Plants differently prioritize defence response at different developmental stages. Plants release volatile cues to mediate ecological interactions, and these metabolites play pivotal role in plant-herbivore interactions."
"Exploring plant metabolic genomics: chemical diversity, metabolic complexity in the biosynthesis and transport of specialized metabolites with the tea plant as a model","The diversity and complexity of secondary metabolites in tea plants contribute substantially to the popularity of tea, by determining tea flavors and their numerous health benefits. The most significant characteristics of tea plants are that they concentrate the complex plant secondary metabolites into one leaf: flavonoids, alkaloids, theanine, volatiles, and saponins. Many fundamental questions regarding tea plant secondary metabolism remain unanswered. This includes how tea plants accumulate high levels of monomeric galloylated catechins, unlike the polymerized flavan-3-ols in most other plants, as well as how they are evolved to selectively synthesize theanine and caffeine, and how tea plants properly transport and store these cytotoxic products and then reuse them in defense. Tea plants coordinate many metabolic pathways that simultaneously take place in young tea leaves in response to both developmental and environmental cues. With the available genome sequences of tea plants and high-throughput metabolomic tools as great platforms, it is of particular interest to launch metabolic genomics studies using tea plants as a model system. Plant metabolic genomics are to investigate all aspects of plant secondary metabolism at the genetic, genome, and molecular levels. This includes plant domestication and adaptation, divergence and convergence of secondary metaboloic pathways. The biosynthesis, transport, storage, and transcriptional regulation mechanisms of all metabolites are of core interest in the plant as a whole. This review highlights relevant contexts of metabolic genomics, outstanding questions, and strategies for answering them, with aim to guide future research for genetic improvement of nutrition quality for healthier plant foods."
"Free and glycosidically bound aroma compounds in fruit: biosynthesis, transformation, and practical control","Fruit aroma makes an initial flavor impression and largely determines the consumer preference and acceptance of fruit products. Free volatile organic compounds (FVOCs) directly make up the characteristic aromas of fruits. While glycosidically bound volatile compounds (GBVs) can be hydrolyzed during fruit ripening, postharvest storage, and processing, releasing the attached aglycones as free volatiles that could alter the overall aroma attributes of fruits. GBVs typically exhibit significantly higher concentrations than their free counterparts in fruits such as grapes, cherries, kiwifruits, tomatoes, and tamarillos. This review highlights the biosynthesis of FVOCs and GBVs in fruit and illustrates their biological transformations for various functional purposes such as detoxification, aroma enhancement, plant defense, and pollinator attraction. Practical applications for regulating the levels of aroma compounds emitted or accumulated in fruit are also reviewed, emphasizing the metabolic engineering of free volatile metabolites and hydrolytic technologies on aroma glycosides. Generally, enzymatic hydrolysis using AR2000 is a common strategy to enhance the sensory attributes of fruit juices/wines, while acidic hydrolysis induces the oxidation and rearrangement of aglycones, generating artifacts with off-aromas. This review associates the occurrence of free and glycosidic bound volatiles in fruit and addresses their importance in fruit flavor enhancement and industrial applications."
"Grape terpenoids: flavor importance, genetic regulation, and future potential","Terpenes significantly affect the flavor and quality of grapes and wine. This review summarizes recent research on terpenoids with regard to grape wine. Although, the grapevine terpene synthase gene family is the largest identified, genetic modifications involving terpenes to improve wine flavor have received little attention. Key enzyme modulation alters metabolite production. Over the last decade, the heterologous manipulation of grape glycosidase has been used to alter terpenoids, and cytochrome P450s may affect terpene synthesis. Metabolic and genetic engineering can further modify terpenoid metabolism, while using transgenic grapevines (trait transfer to the plant) could yield more flavorful wine. We also discuss traits involved in wine aroma quality, and the strategies that can be used to improve grapevine breeding technology."
Hop Aroma and Hoppy Beer Flavor: Chemical Backgrounds and Analytical Tools—A Review,"Hops are the most complex and costly raw material used in brewing. Their chemical composition depends on genetically controlled factors that essentially distinguish hop varieties and is influenced by environmental factors and post-harvest processing. The volatile fingerprint of hopped beer relates to the quantity and quality of the hop dosage and timing of hop addition, as well as the overall brewing technology applied. Analytically, the aroma of hops and the flavor of hoppy beers cannot be measured by quantification of a single odorant; moreover, the selection of several key compounds or a comprehensive characterization (profiling) seems reasonable. Analysis of hops and beer is challenging. The selective enrichment of volatiles from complex matrices, separation, unambiguous identification, and precise quantification are the keywords used in this context. This review outlines the synthesis of relevant hop aroma compounds within the plant. The process that incorporates hops into the final beer is described using the hopping techniques used in the industry. Due to the complexity and multiplicity of chemical compounds found in hops, an attempt was made to simplify the information presented by separating the chemical compounds considered into two broad groups: terpenoids and nonterpenoids. This review summarizes approaches commonly used for analysis of hop aroma compounds in hops and beer."
Metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways leading to isoprenoids: Mono- and sesquiterpenes in plastids and cytosol,"Isoprenoids are a large and structurally diverse family of compounds that play essential roles in plants as hormones, photosynthetic pigments, electron carriers, and membrane components as well as serving in communication and defense. Now it is unequivocally proved that two distinct and independent biosynthetic routes exist to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the two building blocks for isoprenoids in plants. The cytosolic pathway is triggered by Acetyl Coenzyme A where classical intermediate mevalonic acid is formed which, in turn, converts into IPP and DMAPP. These further combine to elongate into sesquiterpenes (C15) and triterpenes (C30); whereas the plastidial pathway provides precursors for the biosynthesis of isoprene (C5), monoterpenes (C10), diterpenes (C20), and tetraterpenes (C40). The pathway is initiated by the transketolase-type condensation of pyruvate (C-2 and C-3) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DXP), followed by the isomerization and reduction of this intermediate to 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP), formation of the cytidine 5'-diphosphate (CDP) derivative, phosphorylation at C2, and cyclization to 2-C-methylerythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (CDP-Me2P as the last defined step). The genes encoding each enzyme of the plastid pathway up to formation of the cyclic diphosphate have been isolated from plants and from eubacteria where the pathway exists. Studies on the complete biosynthetic pathways using radio-labeled substrates will help in characterizing and identifying the enzymes involved in each and every step of cyclization, isomerization, chain elongation, hydrogen shifts, oxidation and hydroxylation during the formation of many isoprenoid compounds present in food and flavor substances and are highly useful to human beings."
Metabolic engineering strategies for sesquiterpene production in microorganism,"Sesquiterpenes are a large variety of terpene natural products, widely existing in plants, fungi, marine organisms, insects, and microbes. Value-added sesquiterpenes are extensively used in industries such as: food, drugs, fragrances, and fuels. With an increase in market demands and the price of sesquiterpenes, the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes by microbial fermentation methods from renewable feedstocks is acquiring increasing attention. Synthetic biology provides robust tools of sesquiterpene production in microorganisms. This review presents a summary of metabolic engineering strategies on the hosts and pathway engineering for sesquiterpene production. Advances in synthetic biology provide new strategies on the creation of desired hosts for sesquiterpene production. Especially, metabolic engineering strategies for the production of sesquiterpenes such as: amorphadiene, farnesene, bisabolene, and caryophyllene are emphasized in: Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and other microorganisms. Challenges and future perspectives of the bioprocess for translating sesquiterpene production into practical industrial work are also discussed."
Metabolie Engineering of Floral Scent of Ornamentals,"Flowers of many plant species emit floral scent to attract pollinators. Such scents are often complex mixtures of various small aliphatic molecules, mostly terpenoid, phenylpropanoid, and benzenoid compounds. However, a large number of commercial flower varieties have lost their scent during the traditional breeding process. This lack of scent has been recognized as one of the major problems in the floriculture industry. Recent discoveries of genes encoding enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of scent compounds, and advances in our understanding of the regulation of scent biosynthetic genes, now make it possible to engineer plants with increased scent or with newly introduced aromas. Past approaches for metabolic engineering of floral scent have used various strategies, including the introduction of new scent genes and the blockage of existing non-scent pathways to divert metabolites into scent production. However, these experiments have only been partially successful. Problems have included the lack of specificity in targeting the expression of the introduced gene to flowers and unexpected biochemical reactions that metabolized the new scent compounds into non-volatile byproducts. Future attempts at scent genetic engineering will need to utilize specific floral gene promoters and be based on a clearer understanding of metabolic fluxes."
Plant Volatiles: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives,"Volatile compounds act as a language that plants use for their communication and interaction with the surrounding environment. To date, a total of 1700 volatile compounds have been isolated from more than 90 plant families. These volatiles, released from leaves, flowers, and fruits into the atmosphere and from roots into the soil, defend plants against herbivores and pathogens or provide a reproductive advantage by attracting pollinators and seed dispersers. Plant volatiles constitute about 1% of plant secondary metabolites and are mainly represented by terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, fatty acid derivatives, and amino acid derivatives. In this review we focus on the functions of plant volatiles, their biosynthesis and regulation, and the metabolic engineering of the volatile spectrum, which results in plant defense improvement and changes of scent and aroma properties of flowers and fruits."
Proteomic sensing associated with terpenoid biosynthesis of Artemisia annua L. in response to different artificial light spectra,"Artificial light has been used to control plant growth and secondary metabolite production. Artemisia annua L. plants were illuminated with three light-emitting diode (LED) spectra to investigate proteomic and biochemical responses. After 7 days, proteomic data revealed different protein numbers in leaves, stems, and roots under particular treatments. Results demonstrated increased accumulation of several proteins, including secondary metabolite-related proteins. The red light (R) (660 nm) highly induced terpenoid proteins. Similar biochemical profiles were observed in white light (W) (445, 544 nm) and blue light (B) (445 nm) conditions, while profiles from R treatment were different. Functional proteins of W and B treatments were involved in the MVA and MEP pathways and sesquiterpene biosynthesis. By contrast, unique proteins in R treatment were mainly expressed in sesquiterpene and tetraterpene biosynthesis. Specific relationships between biosynthetic proteins and sesquiterpenes were observed, suggesting the indispensable role of the light spectrum in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis."
Research progress in biosynthesis and regulation of plant terpenoids,"Terpenoids are aromatic metabolites in plants. They can improve the adaptability of plants to the environment. Some specialized terpenoids have immense value to people because of the applications to medicine, industry and agriculture. However, it is impossible to produce terpenoids in large quantities because of their complex chemical structures and low content in plants. The regulatory mechanism of terpenoids biosynthesis has gradually become a research hot spot. Here, we provide an overview on the synthesis and metabolic pathways, regulatory pathways, and key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids. This paper will provide references for further exploring the molecular regulation and improving the content of terpenoids in plants."
Terpenes and derivatives as a new perspective for pain treatment: a patent review,"Areas covered:  In this review, the authors summarize therapeutic patent applications concerning the employment of terpenes for pain relief, focusing on the perspective for these compounds to become candidates for new drugs intended to control painful syndromes."
"Terpenoid Secondary Metabolites in Bryophytes: Chemical Diversity, Biosynthesis and Biological Functions","Bryophytes are close extant relatives of the ancestral land plant. As such, they have retained many innovations that had enabled the adaptation of early land plants to the terrestrial environment. One of such important innovations is the elaboration of an enormously diverse array of secondary metabolites. This article reviews current knowledge of terpenoid secondary metabolites, which constitute the largest family of plant metabolites, in bryophytes from three perspectives: chemical diversity, biosynthesis, and biological functions. The diversity of terpenoids in bryophytes, particularly in liverworts, is enormously rich. More than 1600 terpenoids have been reported from this plant group. While many terpenoids are observed in both bryophytes and seed plants, some are unique to bryophytes. It is just the beginning for us to understand the molecular and biochemical basis underlying terpenoid biosynthesis in bryophytes. Compared to seed plants, which have only one type of terpene synthase genes, so-called typical plant terpene synthase genes, bryophytes employ not only typical plant terpene synthase genes but also another class of terpene synthase genes called microbial-terpene synthase-like (MTPSL) genes for terpenoid biosynthesis. Biochemical studies suggest the MTPSLs are largely responsible for the terpenoid diversity in bryophytes, particularly sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. Existing literature indicates that terpenoids made by bryophytes have important functions in diverse biological and ecological processes, particularly as defenses against biotic and abiotic stresses. The continued development of genomic resources and molecular tool kit for bryophytes will accelerate characterization of terpenoids biosynthesis and their biological functions in this important lineage of plants."
An update on the function and regulation of methylerythritol phosphate and mevalonate pathways and their evolutionary dynamics,"Isoprenoids are among the largest and most chemically diverse classes of organic compounds in nature and are involved in the processes of photosynthesis, respiration, growth, development, and plant responses to stress. The basic building block units for isoprenoid synthesis—isopentenyl diphosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate—are generated by the mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. Here, we summarize recent advances on the roles of the MEP and MVA pathways in plant growth, development and stress responses, and attempt to define the underlying gene networks that orchestrate the MEP and MVA pathways in response to developmental or environmental cues. Through phylogenomic analysis, we also provide a new perspective on the evolution of the plant isoprenoid pathway. We conclude that the presence of the MVA pathway in plants may be associated with the transition from aquatic to subaerial and terrestrial environments, as lineages for its core components are absent in green algae. The emergence of the MVA pathway has acted as a key evolutionary event in plants that facilitated land colonization and subsequent embryo development, as well as adaptation to new and varied environments."
Biogenic volatile organic compounds in the Earth system,"Biogenic volatile organic compounds produced by plants are involved in plant growth, development, reproduction and defence. They also function as communication media within plant communities, between plants and between plants and insects. Because of the high chemical reactivity of many of these compounds, coupled with their large mass emission rates from vegetation into the atmosphere, they have significant effects on the chemical composition and physical characteristics of the atmosphere. Hence, biogenic volatile organic compounds mediate the relationship between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Alteration of this relationship by anthropogenically driven changes to the environment, including global climate change, may perturb these interactions and may lead to adverse and hard-to-predict consequences for the Earth system.

"Biosynthesis, function and metabolic engineering of plant volatile organic compounds","Plants synthesize an amazing diversity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that facilitate interactions with their environment, from attracting pollinators and seed dispersers to protecting themselves from pathogens, parasites and herbivores. Recent progress in -omics technologies resulted in the isolation of genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of many volatiles and contributed to our understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in VOC formation. In this review, we largely focus on the biosynthesis and regulation of plant volatiles, the involvement of floral volatiles in plant reproduction as well as their contribution to plant biodiversity and applications in agriculture via crop–pollinator interactions. In addition, metabolic engineering approaches for both the improvement of plant defense and pollinator attraction are discussed in light of methodological constraints and ecological complications that limit the transition of crops with modified volatile profiles from research laboratories to real-world implementation."
Capturing of the monoterpene olefin limonene produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Monoterpene olefins such as limonene are plant compounds with applications as flavouring and fragrance agents, as solvents and potentially also in polymer and fuel chemistry. We engineered baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to express a (-)-limonene synthase from Perilla frutescens and a (+)-limonene synthase from Citrus limon. Both proteins were expressed either with their native plastid targeting signal or in a truncated form in which the plastidial sorting signal was removed. The yeast host strain for expression was AE9 K197G, which expresses a mutant Erg20 enzyme. This enzyme catalyses the formation of geranyl diphosphate, which is the precursor for monoterpenes. Several methods were tested to capture limonene produced by the yeast. Extraction from the culture medium by pentane, or by the addition of CaCl2 followed by solid-phase micro-extraction, did not lead to detectable limonene, indicating that limonene is rapidly lost from the culture medium. Volatile terpenes such as limonene may also be trapped in a dodecane phase added to the medium during fermentation. This method resulted in recovery of 0.028?mg/l (+)-limonene and 0.060?mg/l (-)-limonene in strains using the truncated Citrus and Perilla synthases, respectively. Trapping the headspace during culture of the limonene synthase-expressing strains resulted in higher titres, at 0.12?mg/l (+)-limonene and 0.49?mg/l (-)-limonene. These results show that the volatile properties of the olefins produced require specific methods for efficient recovery of these molecules from biotechnological production systems. Gene Bank Nos were: KM015220 (Perilla limonene synthase; this study); AF317695 (Perilla limonene synthase; Yuba et al., 1996); AF514287.1 (Citrus limonene synthase; Lucker et al., 2002).

Carotenoid biosynthesis in plant storage organs: recent advances and prospects for improving plant food quality,"Carotenoids are components of the photosynthetic machinery, intermediates in the biosynthesis of abscisic acid and other apocarotenoids and act as coloured pigments particularly in floral and fruit tissue. Humans benefit in a number of ways from dietary carotenoids present in green leaf tissue and many fruits, seeds, roots and tubers. Carotenoids with a ß-ring end group are required for the synthesis of vitamin A, and deficiency for this vitamin remains a major health problem in some parts of the world. Epidemiological studies suggest that carotenoids also have important roles in a range of diseases including age-related macular degradation and some cancers. The isoprenoid pathway is described, which leads to the carotenoids via the condensation of five-carbon isoprenoid units to form a 40-carbon chain in phytoene. The early part of the biosynthetic pathway involves crosstalk between plastidic and cytosolic components. Desaturation, isomerization, cyclization, hydroxylation and epoxidation of the 40-carbon phytoene gives the range of carotenoids found in plants. The nuclear-encoded enzymes for these stages are targeted to plastids, and in some cases, different members of a gene family are active in plastids in different tissue types. Studies on the transgenic manipulation of the pathway, natural and induced mutants, gene silencing and gene and quantitative trait locus mapping are increasingly unravelling the pathway and its control, giving opportunities for directed manipulation of the types and quantities of these nutritionally important compounds in crop tissues used in human and animal diets."
Chemical convergence between plants and insects: biosynthetic origins and functions of common secondary metabolites,"Despite the phylogenetic distance between plants and insects, these two groups of organisms produce some secondary metabolites in common. Identical structures belonging to chemical classes such as the simple monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, iridoid monoterpenes, cyanogenic glycosides, benzoic acid derivatives, benzoquinones and naphthoquinones are sometimes found in both plants and insects. In addition, very similar glucohydrolases involved in activating two-component defenses, such as glucosinolates and cyanogenic glycosides, occur in both plants and insects. Although this trend was first noted many years ago, researchers have long struggled to find convincing explanations for such co-occurrence. In some cases, identical compounds may be produced by plants to interfere with their function in insects. In others, plant and insect compounds may simply have parallel functions, probably in defense or attraction, and their co-occurrence is a coincidence. The biosynthetic origin of such co-occurring metabolites may be very different in insects as compared to plants. Plants and insects may have different pathways to the same metabolite, or similar sequences of intermediates, but different enzymes. Further knowledge of the ecological roles and biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites may shed more light on why plants and insects produce identical substances."
Determination of specific volatile organic compounds synthesised during Tuber borchiifruit body development by solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry,"Fruit body development is a particular phase of the Tuber life cycle, characterised by the aggregation of different types of hyphae, i.e., vegetative hyphal cells and highly specialised reproductive hyphae (asci). In order to identify the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced in different stages of the Tuber borchii ripening fruit body, solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was used. The volatile organic compounds were extracted using a DVB/CAR/PDMS 50/30?µm fiber placed for 10 min at room temperature in the truffle headspace. The results obtained reveal 49 compounds each of which was present only in a particular stage of maturation. 1-octen-3-ol, aromadendrene, a-farnesene and other terpenoid compounds were of particular interest, and their possible biological roles are discussed. The production of aromadendrene in the completely unripe fruit body suggests the existence of communication events in the early stage of ascomata formation between the fungus and the host plant. a-Farnesene could represent a chemotactic attractant to saprophytic organisms in order to disperse the fungal spores in the environment. The identification of the VOCs produced by truffles during their maturation could give information about the processes underlying this phase of Tuber life cycle.

Effect of land-use change and management on biogenic volatile organic compound emissions – selecting climate-smart cultivars,"Land-use change (LUC) has fundamentally altered the form and function of the terrestrial biosphere. Increasing human population, the drive for higher living standards and the potential challenges of mitigating and adapting to global environmental change mean that further changes in LUC are unavoidable. LUC has direct consequences on climate not only via emissions of greenhouse gases and changing the surface energy balance but also by affecting the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Isoprenoids, which dominate global BVOC emissions, are highly reactive and strongly modify atmospheric composition. The effects of LUC on BVOC emissions and related atmospheric chemistry have been largely ignored so far. However, compared with natural ecosystems, most tree species used in bioenergy plantations are strong BVOC emitters, whereas intensively cultivated crops typically emit less BVOCs. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on LUC-driven BVOC emissions and how these might affect atmospheric composition and climate. We further discuss land management and plant-breeding strategies, which could be taken to move towards climate-friendly BVOC emissions while simultaneously maintaining or improving key ecosystem functions such as crop yield under a changing environment."
Emissions of volatile organic compounds from vegetation and the implications for atmospheric chemistry,"Vegetation provides a major source of reactive carbon entering the atmosphere. These compounds play an important role in (1) shaping global tropospheric chemistry, (2) regional photochemical oxidant formation, (3) balancing the global carbon cycle, and (4) production of organic acids which contribute to acidic deposition in rural areas. Present estimates place the total annual global emission of these compounds between approximately 500 and 825 Tg yr-1. The volatile olefinic compounds, such as isoprene and the monoterpenes, are thought to constitute the bulk of these emissions. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that a variety of partially oxidized hydrocarbons, principally alcohols, are also emitted. The available information concerning the terrestrial vegetation as sources of volatile organic compounds is reviewed. The biochemical processes associated with these emissions of the compounds and the atmospheric chemistry of the emitted compounds are discussed."
Enantiomeric Natural Products: Occurrence and Biogenesis,"In nature, chiral natural products are usually produced in optically pure form—however, occasionally both enantiomers are formed. These enantiomeric natural products can arise from a single species or from different genera and/or species. Extensive research has been carried out over the years in an attempt to understand the biogenesis of naturally occurring enantiomers; however, many fascinating puzzles and stereochemical anomalies still remain."
Engineering isoprene synthesis in cyanobacteria,"The renewable production of isoprene (Isp) hydrocarbons, to serve as fuel and synthetic chemistry feedstock, has attracted interest in the field recently. Isp (C5H8) is naturally produced from sunlight, CO2 and H2O photosynthetically in terrestrial plant chloroplasts via the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway and emitted in the atmosphere as a response to heat stress. Efforts to institute a high capacity continuous and renewable process have included heterologous expression of the Isp synthesis pathway in photosynthetic microorganisms. This review examines the premise and promise emanating from this relatively new research effort. Also examined are the metabolic engineering approaches applied in the quest of renewable Isp hydrocarbons production, the progress achieved so far, and barriers encountered along the way."
Enhancing epi -cedrol production in Escherichia coliby fusion expression of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase and epi -cedrol synthase,"Terpene synthase catalyses acyclic diphosphate farnesyl diphosphate into desired sesquiterpenes. In this study, a fusion enzyme was constructed by linking Santalum album farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (SaFPPS) individually with terpene synthase and Artemisia annua Epi-cedrol synthase (AaECS). The stop codon at the N-terminus of SaFPPS was removed and replaced by a short peptide (GSGGS) to introduce a linker between the two open reading frames. This fusion clone was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosseta DE3 cells. The fusion enzyme FPPS-ECS produced sesquiterpene 8-epi-cedrol from substrates isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate through sequential reactions. The Km values for FPPS-ECS for isopentyl diphosphate was 4.71 µM. The fusion enzyme carried out the efficient conversion of IPP to epi-cedrol, in comparison to single enzymes SaFPPS and AaECS when combined together in enzyme assay over time. Further, the recombinant E. coli BL21 strain harbouring fusion plasmid successfully produced epi-cedrol in fermentation medium. The strain having fusion plasmid (pET32a-FPPS-ECS) produced 1.084 ± 0.09 mg/L epi-cedrol, while the strain harbouring mixed plasmid (pRSETB-FPPS and pET28a-ECS) showed 1.002 ± 0.07 mg/L titre in fermentation medium by overexpression and MEP pathway utilization. Structural analysis was done by I-TASSER server and docking was done by AutoDock Vina software, which suggested that secondary structure of the N- C terminal domain and their relative positions to functional domains of the fusion enzyme was greatly significant to the catalytic properties of the fusion enzymatic complex than individual enzymes."
Evolution of TPS20-related terpene synthases influences chemical diversity in the glandular trichomes of the wild tomato relative Solanum habrochaites,"A systematic screen of volatile terpene production in the glandular trichomes of 79 accessions of Solanum habrochaites was conducted and revealed the presence of 21 mono- and sesquiterpenes that exhibit a range of qualitative and quantitative variation. Hierarchical clustering identified distinct terpene phenotypic modules with shared patterns of terpene accumulation across accessions. Several terpene modules could be assigned to previously identified terpene synthase (TPS) activities that included members of the TPS-e/f subfamily that utilize the unusual cis-prenyl diphosphate substrates neryl diphosphate and 2z,6z-farnesyl diphosphate. DNA sequencing and in vitro enzyme activity analysis of TPS-e/f members from S. habrochaites identified three previously unassigned enzyme activities that utilize these cisoid substrates. These produce either the monoterpenes a-pinene and limonene, or the sesquiterpene 7-epizingiberene, with the in vitro analyses that recapitulated the trichome chemistry found in planta. Comparison of the distribution of S. habrochaites accessions with terpene content revealed a strong preference for the presence of particular TPS20 alleles at distinct geographic locations. This study reveals that the unusually high intra-specific variation of volatile terpene synthesis in glandular trichomes of S. habrochaites is due at least in part to evolution at the TPS20 locus."
Expression of Clarkia S -linalool synthase in transgenic petunia plants results in the accumulation of S -linalyl-ß-d-glucopyranoside,"Petunia hybrida W115 was transformed with a Clarkia breweri S-linalool synthase cDNA (lis). Lis was expressed in all tissues analysed, and linalool was detected in leaves, sepals, corolla, stem and ovary, but not in nectaries, roots, pollen and style. However, the S-linalool produced by the plant in the various tissues is not present as free linalool, but was efficiently converted to non-volatile S-linalyl-ß-d-glucopyranoside by the action of endogenous glucosyltransferase. The results presented demonstrate that monoterpene production can be altered by genetic modification, and that the compounds produced can be converted by endogenous enzymatic activity."
Farnesol production from Escherichia coliby harnessing the exogenous mevalonate pathway,"Farnesol (FOH) production has been carried out in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. FOH is formed through the depyrophosphorylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which is synthesized from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) by FPP synthase. In order to increase FPP synthesis, E. coli was metabolically engineered to overexpress ispA and to utilize the foreign mevalonate (MVA) pathway for the efficient synthesis of IPP and DMAPP. Two-phase culture using a decane overlay of the culture broth was applied to reduce volatile loss of FOH produced during culture and to extract FOH from the culture broth. A FOH production of 135.5?mg/L was obtained from the recombinant E. coli harboring the pTispA and pSNA plasmids for ispA overexpression and MVA pathway utilization, respectively. It is interesting to observe that a large amount of FOH could be produced from E. coli without FOH synthase by the augmentation of FPP synthesis. Introduction of the exogenous MVA pathway enabled the dramatic production of FOH by E. coli while no detectable FOH production was observed in the endogenous MEP pathway-only control. Biotechnol.

Floral volatiles: from biosynthesis to function,"Floral volatiles have attracted humans' attention since antiquity and have since then permeated many aspects of our lives. Indeed, they are heavily used in perfumes, cosmetics, flavourings and medicinal applications. However, their primary function is to mediate ecological interactions between flowers and a diverse array of visitors, including pollinators, florivores and pathogens. As such, they ultimately ensure the plants' reproductive and evolutionary success. To date, over 1700 floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been identified. Interestingly, they are derived from only a few biochemical networks, which include the terpenoid, phenylpropanoid/benzenoid and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. These pathways are intricately regulated by endogenous and external factors to enable spatially and temporally controlled emission of floral volatiles, thereby fine-tuning the ecological interactions facilitated by floral volatiles. In this review, we will focus on describing the biosynthetic pathways leading to floral VOCs, the regulation of floral volatile emission, as well as biological functions of emitted volatiles."
Fueling the future with biomass: Processes and pathways for a sustainable supply of hydrocarbon fuels and biogas,"Global economic growth, wealth and security rely upon the availability of cheap, mostly fossil-derived energy and chemical compounds. The replacement by sustainable resources is widely discussed. However, the current state of biotechnological processes usually restricts them to be used as a true alternative in terms of economic feasibility and even sustainability. Among the rare examples of bioprocesses applied for the energetic use of biomass are biogas and bioethanol production. Usually, these processes lack in efficiency and they cannot be operated without the support of legislation. Although they represent a first step towards a greater share of bio-based processes for energy provision, there is no doubt that tremendous improvements in strain and process development, feedstock and process flexibility as well as in the integration of these processes into broader supply and production networks, in this review called smart bioproduction grids, are required to make them economically attractive, robust enough, and wider acceptance by society. All this requires an interdisciplinary approach, which includes the use of residues in closed carbon cycles and issues concerning the process safety. This short review aims to depict some of the promising strategies to achieve an improved process performance as a basis for future application."
Genetic control of a-farnesene production in apple fruit and its role in fungal pathogenesis,"Terpenes are important compounds in plant trophic interactions. A meta-analysis of GC-MS data from a diverse range of apple (Malus × domestica) genotypes revealed that apple fruit produces a range of terpene volatiles, with the predominant terpene being the acyclic branched sesquiterpene (E,E)-a-farnesene. Four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for a-farnesene production in ripe fruit were identified in a segregating ‘Royal Gala’ (RG) × ‘Granny Smith’ (GS) population with one major QTL on linkage group 10 co-locating with the MdAFS1 (a-farnesene synthase-1) gene. Three of the four QTLs were derived from the GS parent, which was consistent with GC-MS analysis of headspace and solvent-extracted terpenes showing that cold-treated GS apples produced higher levels of (E,E)-a-farnesene than RG. Transgenic RG fruit downregulated for MdAFS1 expression produced significantly lower levels of (E,E)-a-farnesene. To evaluate the role of (E,E)-a-farnesene in fungal pathogenesis, MdAFS1 RNA interference transgenic fruit and RG controls were inoculated with three important apple post-harvest pathogens [Colletotrichum acutatum, Penicillium expansum and Neofabraea alba (synonym Phlyctema vagabunda)]. From results obtained over four seasons, we demonstrate that reduced (E,E)-a-farnesene is associated with decreased disease initiation rates of all three pathogens. In each case, the infection rate was significantly reduced 7 days post-inoculation, although the size of successful lesions was comparable with infections on control fruit. These results indicate that (E,E)-a-farnesene production is likely to be an important factor involved in fungal pathogenesis in apple fruit."
Herbivore-induced and constitutive volatiles are controlled by different oxylipin-dependent mechanisms in rice,"Despite the importance of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for plants, control mechanisms for their basal and stress-induced biosynthesis and release remain unclear. We sampled and characterized headspace and internal leaf volatile pools in rice (Oryza sativa), after a simulated herbivory treatment, which triggers an endogenous jasmonate burst. Certain volatiles, such as linalool, were strongly upregulated by simulated herbivory stress. In contrast, other volatiles, such as ß-caryophyllene, were constitutively emitted and fluctuated according to time of day. Transcripts of the linalool synthase gene transiently increased 1–3 h after exposure of rice to simulated herbivory, whereas transcripts of caryophyllene synthase peaked independently at dawn. Unexpectedly, although emission and accumulation patterns of rice inducible and constitutive VOCs were substantially different, both groups of volatiles were compromised in jasmonate-deficient hebiba mutants, which lack the allene oxide cyclase (AOC) gene. This suggests that rice employs at least two distinct oxylipin-dependent mechanisms downstream of AOC to control production of constitutive and herbivore-induced volatiles. Levels of the JA precursor, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), were correlated with constitutive volatile levels suggesting that OPDA or its derivatives could be involved in control of volatile emission in rice."
"High-level production of amorpha-4,11-diene in a two-phase partitioning bioreactor of metabolically engineered Escherichia coli","Reconstructing synthetic metabolic pathways in microbes holds great promise for the production of pharmaceuticals in large-scale fermentations. By recreating biosynthetic pathways in bacteria, complex molecules traditionally harvested from scarce natural resources can be produced in microbial cultures. Here we report on a strain of Escherichia coli containing a heterologous, nine-gene biosynthetic pathway for the production of the terpene amorpha-4,11-diene, a precursor to the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. Previous reports have underestimated the productivity of this strain due to the volatility of amorphadiene. Here we show that amorphadiene evaporates from a fermentor with a half-life of about 50 min. Using a condenser, we take advantage of this volatility by trapping the amorphadiene in the off-gas. Amorphadiene was positively identified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and determined to be 89% pure as collected. We captured amorphadiene as it was produced in situ by employing a two-phase partitioning bioreactor with a dodecane organic phase. Using a previously characterized caryophyllene standard to calibrate amorphadiene production and capture, the concentration of amorphadiene produced was determined to be 0.5 g/L of culture medium. A standard of amorphadiene collected from the off-gas showed that the caryophyllene standard overestimated amorphadiene production by approximately 30%. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
IdsA is the major geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase involved in carotenogenesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum,"Corynebacterium glutamicum, a yellow-pigmented soil bacterium that synthesizes the rare cyclic C50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin and its glucosides, has been engineered for the production of various carotenoids. CrtE was assumed to be the major geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase in carotenogenesis; however, deletion of crtE did not abrogate carotenoid synthesis. In silico analysis of the repertoire of prenyltransferases encoded by the C. glutamicum genome revealed two candidate GGPPS genes (idsA and ispB). The absence of pigmentation of an idsA deletion mutant and complementation experiments with a double deletion mutant lacking both idsA and crtE showed that IdsA is the major GGPPS of C. glutamicum and that crtE overexpression compensated for the lack of IdsA, whereas plasmid-borne overexpression of ispB did not. Purified His-tagged CrtE was active as a homodimer, whereas the active form of IdsA was homotetrameric. Both enzymes catalyzed prenyl transfer with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesylphosphate (FPP) as substrates. IdsA showed the highest catalytic efficiency with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and IPP, whereas the catalytic efficiency of CrtE was highest with geranyl pyrophosphate and IPP. Finally, application of prenyltransferase overexpression revealed that combined overexpression of idsA and the IPP isomerase gene idi in the absence of crtE led to the highest decaprenoxanthin titer reported to date."
Impact of agronomic practices on grape aroma composition: a review,"Aroma compounds are secondary metabolites that play a key role in grape quality for enological purposes. Terpenes, C13-norisoprenoids, phenols, and non-terpenic alcohols are the most important aroma compounds in grapes and they can be found as free volatiles or glycoconjugated (bound) molecules. The non-volatile glycosylated group is the largest, and it is present in all varieties of Vitis vinifera (L.), the most widely used species for wine production. These aroma precursors represent the reserve of aroma molecules that can be released during winemaking. Their relative and absolute concentrations at fruit ripening determine the organoleptic value of the final product. A large range of biotic and abiotic factors can influence their biosynthesis in several ways. Agronomic practices such as irrigation, training systems, leaf removal, and bunch thinning can have an effect at plant level. The spraying of stimulatory compounds on fruit at different developmental stages has also been shown to modify metabolic pathways at fruit level with some impact on the aroma composition of the grapevine fruit. Viticulturists could act to promote aroma precursors to improve the aromatic profile of grapes and the wine ultimately produced. However, agronomic practices do not always have uniform results. The metabolic and physiological changes resulting from agronomic practices are unknown because there has not been sufficient research to date. This review presents the state of the art regarding the influences of vineyard agronomic management on the biosynthesis of grape aroma compounds. Although literature regarding the topic is abundant there are still many unknown biological mechanisms involved and/or that have been insufficiently studied. The aim of this work is therefore to find the gaps in scientific literature so that future investigations can focus on them. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry"
Isoprenoids: Remarkable diversity of form and function,"The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is the source of a wide array of products. The pathway has been highly conserved throughout evolution, and isoprenoids are some of the most ancient biomolecules ever identified, playing key roles in many life forms. In this review we focus on C-10 mono-, C-15 sesqui-, and C-20 diterpenes. Evidence for interconversion between the pathway intermediates farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranly pyrophosphate and their respective metabolites is examined. The diverse functions of these molecules are discussed in detail, including their ability to regulate expression of the ß-HMG-CoA reductase and Ras-related proteins. Additional topics include the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic effects of select isoprenoids, antiulcer activities, and the disposition and degradation of isoprenoids in the environment. Finally, the significance of pharmacological manipulation of the isoprenoid pathway and clinical correlations are discussed."
Lepidopteran herbivory and oral factors induce transcripts encoding novel terpene synthases in Medicago truncatula†,"Terpenes are an important class of defense compounds that accumulate in plants after pathogen infection or arthropod injury. Sequences predicted to encode terpene synthases were selected from an expressed sequence tag (EST) database of Medicago truncatula. Four putative terpene synthase clones (MtTps1–MtTps4), originating from a chewing insect-damaged M. truncatula leaf cDNA library, were isolated. Transcript levels of each gene examined increased in response to artificial wounding, Spodoptera exigua herbivory, and treatment with volatile methyl jasmonate (meJA). Addition of S. exigua regurgitant to wound sites triggered transcript accumulation of MtTps1 and levels increased with higher concentrations of regurgitant. Furthermore, induction of MtTps1 occurred after application of N-linolenoyl-glutamate or N-linoleoyl-glutamate, factors found in lepidopteran regurgitant. Genomic DNA blots indicate that each of the putative proteins is encoded by a single-copy gene or a small gene family. Proteins encoded by MtTps3 and MtTps4 are imported into the soluble fraction of chloroplasts in in vitro assays, whereas proteins encoded by MtTps1 and MtTps2 are not imported into chloroplasts. Combined with sequence comparisons of multiple plant terpene synthases, the import data indicate that MtTps1 and MtTps2 likely encode sesquiterpene synthases and that MtTps3 and MtTps4 encode mono- or di-terpene synthases. In addition to serving as a valuable model legume species for genomic studies, M. truncatula should prove a valuable source of novel terpene-producing enzymes. Induction of wound-responsive genes by insect oral factors suggests that M. truncatula senses biotic damage through the presence of elicitors originating in the herbivore. Arch. Insect Biochem.

Metabolic engineering of aroma components in fruits,"Plants have the ability to produce a diversity of volatile metabolites, which attract pollinators and seed dispersers and strengthen plant defense responses. Selection by plant breeders of traits such as rapid growth and yield leads, in many cases, to the loss of flavor and aroma quality in crops. How the aroma can be improved without affecting other fruit attributes is a major unsolved issue. Significant advances in metabolic engineering directed at improving the set of volatiles that the fruits emit has been aided by the characterization of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of flavor and aroma compounds in some fruits. However, before this technology can be successfully applied to modulate the production of volatiles in different crops, further basic research is needed on the mechanisms that lead to the production of these compounds in plants. Here we review the biosynthesis and function of volatile compounds in plants, and the attempts that have been made to manipulate fruit aroma biosynthesis by metabolic engineering. In addition, we discuss the possibilities that molecular breeding offers for aroma enhancement and the implications of the latest advances in biotechnological modification of fruit flavor and aroma."
"Metabolic engineering of plant monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes—current status and future opportunities","Terpenoids (a.k.a. isoprenoids) represent the most diverse class of natural products found in plants, with tens of thousands of reported structures. Plant-derived terpenoids have a multitude of pharmaceutical and industrial applications, but the natural resources for their extraction are often limited and, in many cases, synthetic routes are not commercially viable. Some of the most valuable terpenoids are not accumulated in model plants or crops, and genetic resources for breeding of terpenoid natural product traits are thus poorly developed. At present, metabolic engineering, either in the native producer or a heterologous host, is the only realistic alternative to improve yield and accessibility. In this review article, we will evaluate the state of the art of modulating the biosynthetic pathways for the production of mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes in plants."
Metabolic Engineering of Plant-derived (E )-ß-farnesene Synthase Genes for a Novel Type of Aphid-resistant Genetically Modified Crop Plants†,"Aphids are major agricultural pests that cause significant yield losses of crop plants each year. Excessive dependence on insecticides for long-term aphid control is undesirable because of the development of insecticide resistance, the potential negative effects on non-target organisms and environmental pollution. Transgenic crops engineered for resistance to aphids via a non-toxic mode of action could be an efficient alternative strategy. (E)-ß-Farnesene (EßF) synthases catalyze the formation of EßF, which for many pest aphids is the main component of the alarm pheromone involved in the chemical communication within these species. EßF can also be synthesized by certain plants but is then normally contaminated with inhibitory compounds. Engineering of crop plants capable of synthesizing and emitting EßF could cause repulsion of aphids and also the attraction of natural enemies that use EßF as a foraging cue, thus minimizing aphid infestation. In this review, the effects of aphids on host plants, plants’ defenses against aphid herbivory and the recruitment of natural enemies for aphid control in an agricultural setting are briefly introduced. Furthermore, the plant-derived EßF synthase genes cloned to date along with their potential roles in generating novel aphid resistance via genetically modified approaches are discussed."
