Abstract
"The chemical properties and diversity of volatile isoprenoids lends them to a broad variety of biological roles. It also lends them to a host of biotechnological applications, both by taking advantage of their natural functions and by using them as industrial chemicals/chemical feedstocks. Natural functions include roles as insect attractants and repellents, abiotic stress protectants in pathogen defense, etc. Industrial applications include use as pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, fuels, fuel additives, etc. Here we will examine the ways in which researchers have so far found to exploit volatile isoprenoids using biotechnology. Production and/or modification of volatiles using metabolic engineering in both plants and microorganisms are reviewed, including engineering through both mevalonate and methylerythritol diphosphate pathways. Recent advances are illustrated using several case studies (herbivores and bodyguards, isoprene, and monoterpene production in microbes). Systems and synthetic biology tools with particular utility for metabolic engineering are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss the practical realities of various applications in modern biotechnology, explore possible future applications, and examine the challenges of moving these technologies forward so that they can deliver tangible benefits. While this review focuses on volatile isoprenoids, many of the engineering approaches described here are also applicable to non-isoprenoid volatiles and to non-volatile isoprenoids."
"Terpenes constitute a distinct class of natural products1 that attract insects2, defend against phytopathogenic microbes3 and combat human diseases4. However, like most natural products, they are usually made by plants and microbes in small amounts and as complex mixtures. Chemical synthesis is often costly and inefficient, and may not yield enantiomerically pure terpenes, whereas large-scale microbial production requires expensive feedstocks. We engineered high-level terpene production in tobacco plants by diverting carbon flow from cytosolic or plastidic isopentenyl diphosphate through overexpression in either compartment of an avian farnesyl diphosphate synthase and an appropriate terpene synthase. Isotopic labeling studies suggest little, if any, metabolite exchange between these two subcellular compartments. The strategy increased synthesis of the sesquiterpenes patchoulol and amorpha-4,11-diene more than 1,000-fold, as well as the monoterpene limonene 10–30 fold, and seems equally suited to generating higher levels of other terpenes for research, industrial production or therapeutic applications"
"The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway provides intermediates for the synthesis of a multitude of natural products which serve numerous biochemical functions in plants: sterols (isoprenoids with a C30 backbone) are essential components of membranes; carotenoids (C40) and chlorophylls (which contain a C20 isoprenoid side-chain) act as photosynthetic pigments; plastoquinone, phylloquinone and ubiquinone (all of which contain long isoprenoid side-chains) participate in electron transport chains; gibberellins (C20), brassinosteroids (C30) and abscisic acid (C15) are phytohormones derived from isoprenoid intermediates; prenylation of proteins (with C15 or C20 isoprenoid moieties) may mediate subcellular targeting and regulation of activity; and several monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and diterpenes (C20) have been demonstrated to be involved in plant defense. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genes coding for enzymes involved in the metabolism of isoprenoid-derived compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana. By combining homology and sequence motif searches with knowledge regarding the phylogenetic distribution of pathways of isoprenoid metabolism across species, candidate genes for these pathways in A. thalianawere obtained. A detailed analysis of the vicinity of chromosome loci for genes of isoprenoid metabolism in A. thaliana provided evidence for the clustering of genes involved in common pathways. Multiple sequence alignments were used to estimate the number of genes in gene families and sequence relationship trees were utilized to classify their individual members. The integration of all these datasets allows the generation of a knowledge-based metabolic map of isoprenoid metabolic pathways in A. thaliana and provides a substantial improvement of the currently available gene annotation"
"Plant volatiles are crucial for various interactions with other organisms and their surrounding environment. A large number of these volatiles belong to the terpenoid and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid classes, which have long been considered to be exclusively synthesized from a few canonical pathways. However, several alternative pathways producing these plant volatiles have been discovered recently. This review summarizes the current knowledge about new pathways for these two major groups of plant volatiles, which open new perspectives for applications in metabolic engineering"
"Volatile terpenoids released from different plant parts play crucial roles in pollinator attraction,  plant defense, and interaction with the surrounding environment. Two distinct pathways localized in different subcellular compartments are responsible for the biosynthesis of these compounds. Recent advances in the characterization of genes and enzymes responsible for substrate and end product biosynthesis as well as efforts in metabolic engineering have revealed new aspects of volatile terpenoid biosynthesis. This review summarizes recent progress in the characterization of volatile terpenoid biosynthetic genes,  their spatio-temporal expression patterns and subcellular localization of corresponding proteins. In addition, recent information obtained from metabolic engineering is discussed"
"Terpenoids represent the largest class of secondary metabolites and usually do not contain nitrogen or sulfur in their structures. Many terpenoids serve as defence compounds against microbes and herbivores and/or are signal molecules to attract pollinating insects, fruit-dispersing animals or predators which can destroy insect herbivores. As a consequence, many terpenoids have pronounced pharmacological activities and are therefore interesting for medicine and biotechnology. The first part of the biosynthesis is the generation of a C5 unit, such as isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) or dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Two independent pathways have been discovered that can produce the C5 unit: the mevalonate and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Depending on the number of C5 units, we distinguish hemiterpenes C5, monoterpenes including iridoids (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), sesterterpenes (C25), triterpenes (including steroids) (C30), tetraterpenes (C40) and polyterpenes (>C40). The biosynthesis (including enzymes, genes and their regulation) of mevalonate and the methylerythritol phosphate pathway and the consecutive pathways leading to mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes are discussed in this chapter in detail."
"Terpene synthases are responsible for synthesis of a large number of terpenes in plants using substrates provided by two distinct metabolic pathways, the mevalonate-dependent pathway that is located in cytosol and has been suggested to be responsible for synthesis of sesquiterpenes (C15), and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway located in plastids and suggested to be responsible for the synthesis of hemi- (C5), mono- (C10), and diterpenes (C20). Recent advances in characterization of genes and enzymes responsible for substrate and end product biosynthesis as well as efforts in metabolic engineering have demonstrated existence of a number of multi-substrate terpene synthases. This review summarizes the progress in the characterization of such multi-substrate terpene synthases and suggests that the presence of multi-substrate use might have been significantly underestimated. Multi-substrate use could lead to important changes in terpene product profiles upon substrate profile changes under perturbation of metabolism in stressed plants as well as under certain developmental stages. We therefore argue that multi-substrate use can be significant under physiological conditions and can result in complicate modifications in terpene profiles"
"The biogenetic origin of the isoprenoid building blocks of the sesquiterpene germacrene D was studied in Solidago canadensis. Feeding experiments were carried out with 1-[5,5-d2]deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (D2-DOXP), [5-13C]mevalonolactone (13C-MVL) and [1-13C]-d-glucose. The hydrodistillate of a cut shoot fed with D2-DOXP was investigated by enantio-MDGC–MS and the volatile fraction of a shoot supplied with 13C-MVL was examined by GC–C–IRMS. The incorporation of [1-13C]-d-glucose was analyzed by quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy after isolation of germacrene D from the essential oil. Our labeling studies revealed that the biosynthesis of the C-15 skeleton of sesquiterpene germacrene D in Solidago canadensis proceeds predominantly via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway"
"Terpenoids, the largest class of plant secondary metabolites, play essential roles in both plant and human life. In higher plants, the five-carbon building blocks of all terpenoids, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate, are derived from two independent pathways localized in different cellular compartments. The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP or nonmevalonate) pathway, localized in the plastids, is thought to provide IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate for hemiterpene, monoterpene, and diterpene biosynthesis, whereas the cytosol-localized mevalonate pathway provides C5 units for sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Stable isotope-labeled, pathway-specific precursors (1-deoxy-[5,5-2H2]-D-xylulose and [2,2-2H2]-mevalolactone) were supplied to cut snapdragon flowers, which emit both monoterpenes and the sesquiterpene, nerolidol. We show that only one of the two pathways, the plastid-localized MEP pathway, is active in the formation of volatile terpenes. The MEP pathway provides IPP precursors for both plastidial monoterpene and cytosolic sesquiterpene biosynthesis in the epidermis of snapdragon petals. The trafficking of IPP occurs unidirectionally from the plastids to cytosol. The MEP pathway operates in a rhythmic manner controlled by the circadian clock, which determines the rhythmicity of terpenoid emission."
"In higher plants, both the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and mevalonate (MVA) pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. However, despite a significant amount of research on the activity of these pathways under different conditions, the relative contribution of each to the biosynthesis of diverse isoprenoids remains unclear. In this work, we examined the formation of several classes of isoprenoids in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). After feeding [5,5-2H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose ([5,5-2H2]DOX) and [2-13C]MVA to intact cotton seedlings hydroponically, incorporation into isoprenoids was analyzed by MS and NMR. The predominant pattern of incorporation followed the classical scheme in which C5units from the MEP pathway were used to form monoterpenes (C10), phytol side chains (C20) and carotenoids (C40) while C5 units from the MVA pathway were used to form sesquiterpenes (C15), terpenoid aldehydes (C15 and C25) and steroids/triterpenoids (C30). However, both pathways contributed to all classes of terpenoids, sometimes substantially. For example, the MEP pathway provided up to 20% of the substrate for sterols and the MVA pathway provided as much as 50% of the substrate for phytol side chains and carotenoids. Incorporation of C5 units from the MEP pathway was highest in cotyledons, compared to true leaves, and not observed at all in the roots. Incorporation of C5 units from the MVA pathway was highest in the roots (into sterols) and more prominent in the first true leaves than in other above-ground organs. The relative accumulation of label in intermediates vs. end products of phytosterol metabolism confirmed previous identification of slow steps in this pathway."
"Isoprenoids are a large and structurally diverse family of compounds that play essential roles in plants as hormones, photosynthetic pigments, electron carriers, and membrane components as well as serving in communication and defense. Now it is unequivocally proved that two distinct and independent biosynthetic routes exist to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the two building blocks for isoprenoids in plants. The cytosolic pathway is triggered by Acetyl Coenzyme A where classical intermediate mevalonic acid is formed which, in turn, converts into IPP and DMAPP. These further combine to elongate into sesquiterpenes (C15) and triterpenes (C30); whereas the plastidial pathway provides precursors for the biosynthesis of isoprene (C5), monoterpenes (C10), diterpenes (C20), and tetraterpenes (C40). The pathway is initiated by the transketolase-type condensation of pyruvate (C-2 and C-3) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DXP), followed by the isomerization and reduction of this intermediate to 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP), formation of the cytidine 5'-diphosphate (CDP) derivative, phosphorylation at C2, and cyclization to 2-C-methylerythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (CDP-Me2P as the last defined step). The genes encoding each enzyme of the plastid pathway up to formation of the cyclic diphosphate have been isolated from plants and from eubacteria where the pathway exists. Studies on the complete biosynthetic pathways using radio-labeled substrates will help in characterizing and identifying the enzymes involved in each and every step of cyclization, isomerization, chain elongation, hydrogen shifts, oxidation and hydroxylation during the formation of many isoprenoid compounds present in food and flavor substances and are highly useful to human beings"
"Plants produce a plethora of volatile compounds for both general and specialized functions. Recent advances in instrumentation, coupled with our present ability to isolate and characterize genes and the enzymes they encode from many diverse plant species, have greatly enhanced our understanding of how plants synthezise such compounds and regulate their production. The next level of understanding should surely come from studying the significance of these volatiles for plant physiology and their impact on the ecological interac- tions of plants with their environment "
"The sessile nature of plants has resulted in the evolution of an extraordinarily diverse suite of protective mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses. Though volatile isoprenoids are known to be involved in many types of biotic interactions, they also play important but relatively unappreciated roles in abiotic stress responses. We review those roles, discuss the proposed mechanistic explanations and examine the evolutionary significance of volatile isoprenoid emission. We note that abiotic stress responses generically involve production of reactive oxygen species in plant cells, and volatile isoprenoids mitigate the effects of oxidative stress by mediating the oxidative status of the plant. On the basis of these observations, we propose a 'single biochemical mechanism for multiple physiological stressors' model, whereby the protective effect against abiotic stress is exerted through direct or indirect improvement in resistance to damage by reactive oxygen species."
"Among plant secondary metabolites, volatile isoprenoids have received increasing attention because they are involved in a range of physiological and ecological interactions, often helping plants cope with abiotic and biotic stressors, and potentially affecting the chemistry of the troposphere once they are emitted in the air. We review evidence about the beneficial functions of volatile isoprenoids in leaves, principally as antioxidants and membrane stabilizing agents, avoiding heat damage. Because the Mediterranean environment is characterized by prolonged dry and hot seasons, and recurrent heat-waves, we surmise that volatile isoprenoids are particularly widespread, and play an important physiological role, in Mediterranean woody plants. Based on a review of available inventories, isoprene emission characterizes deciduous woody plants, whereas evergreens are more often monoterpene emitters. Monoterpene emitters may be better fit to the Mediterranean climate, and, in general, to climate conditions favoring evergreens."
"Individual biotic and abiotic stresses, such as high temperature, high light and herbivore attack, are well known to increase the emission of volatile organic compounds from plants. Much less is known about the effect of multiple, co-occurring stress factors, despite the fact that multiple stresses are probably the rule under natural conditions. Here, after briefly summarizing the basic effects of single stress factors on the volatile emission of plants, we survey the influence of multiple stresses. When two or more stresses co-occur their effects are sometimes additive, while in other cases the influence of one stress has priority. Further investigations on the effects of multiple stress factors will improve our understanding of the patterns and functions of plant volatile emission"
"Volatile compounds act as a language that plants use for their communication and interaction with the surrounding environment. To date, a total of 1700 volatile compounds have been isolated from more than 90 plant families. These volatiles, released from leaves, flowers, and fruits into the atmosphere and from roots into the soil, defend plants against herbivores and pathogens or provide a reproductive advantage by attracting pollinators and seed dispersers. Plant volatiles constitute about 1% of plant secondary metabolites and are mainly represented by terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, fatty acid derivatives, and amino acid derivatives. In this review we focus on the functions of plant volatiles, their biosynthesis and regulation, and the metabolic engineering of the volatile spectrum, which results in plant defense improvement and changes of scent and aroma properties of flowers and fruits"
"In aromatic plants species, biosynthesis of essential oils occurs through two complex natural biochemical pathways involving different enzymatic reactions. Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) are the universal precursors of essential oil biosynthesis and are produced by the cytosolic enzymatic MVA (mevalonic acid) pathway or by plastidic and enzymatic 1-deoxy-d-xylolose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway, also called the 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. In the particular plant cell part, prenyl diphosphate synthases condense isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) further to form prenyl diphosphates, which are used as substrates for geranyl diphosphate (GPP; C10) or for fernesyl diphosphate (FPP; C15). Essential oils are final terpenoid products and are formed by a huge group of enzymes known as terpene synthases (TPS). Essential oils are important secondary metabolites of plants and have been used not only in different industries but also in ethnobotanical medicines for centuries. Hence, considerable research has been undertaken to understand the essential oil biosynthetic pathways. This review will be a valuable source of information in the field of natural products, as we give detailed insights about biosynthesis of essential oils in plants and thus indicate also new unexplored horizons for further research"
"Defense-related terpenoid biosynthesis in conifers is a dynamic process closely associated with specialized anatomical structures that allows conifers to cope with attack from many potential pests and pathogens. The constitutive and inducible terpenoid defense of conifers involves several hundred different monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Changing arrays of these many compounds are formed from the general isoprenoid pathway by activities of large gene families for two classes of enzymes, the terpene synthases and the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases of the CYP720B group. Extensive studies have been conducted on the genomics, proteomics and molecular biochemical characterization of these enzymes. Many of the conifer terpene synthases are multi-product enzymes, and the P450 enzymes of the CYP720B group are promiscuous in catalyzing multiple oxidations, along homologous series of diterpenoids, from a broad spectrum of substrates. The terpene synthases and CYP720B genes respond to authentic or simulated insect attack with increased transcript levels, protein abundance and enzyme activity. The constitutive and induced oleoresin terpenoids for conifer defense accumulate in preformed cortical resin ducts and in xylem trauma-associated resin ducts. Formation of these resin ducts de novo in the cambium zone and developing xylem, following insect attack or treatment of trees with methyl jasmonate, is a unique feature of the induced defense of long-lived conifer trees"
"Plant genomes encode isopentenyl phosphate kinases (IPKs) that reactivate isopentenyl phosphate (IP) via ATP-dependent phosphorylation, forming the primary metabolite isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) used generally for isoprenoid/terpenoid biosynthesis. Therefore, the existence of IPKs in plants raises unanswered questions concerning the origin and regulatory roles of IP in plant terpenoid metabolism. Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence showing that IP forms during specific dephosphorylation of IPP catalysed by a subset of Nudix superfamily hydrolases. Increasing metabolically available IP by overexpression of a bacterial phosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MPD) in Nicotiana tabacum resulted in significant enhancement in both monoterpene and sesquiterpene production. These results indicate that perturbing IP metabolism results in measurable changes in terpene products derived from both the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and mevalonate (MVA) pathways. Moreover, the unpredicted peroxisomal localization of bacterial MPD led us to discover that the step catalysed by phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) imposes a hidden constraint on flux through the classical MVA pathway. These complementary findings fundamentally alter conventional views of metabolic regulation of terpenoid metabolism in plants and provide new metabolic engineering targets for the production of high-value terpenes in plants"
